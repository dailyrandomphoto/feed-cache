  &lt;p&gt;Blocks? Chains? How does this whole thing work?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="g4oerr"&gt;If you’re like me, you’ve probably spent the last decade hearing about blockchain technology and all the ways it’ll change the world. And at some point, you’ve probably wondered, “Hey… what the heck even &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a blockchain?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZghJgI"&gt;So, like Gandalf giving Bilbo a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22608361/jrr-token-cryptocurrency-one-ring-lord-of-the-rings"&gt;Tolkien-themed cryptocoins&lt;/a&gt; and sending him on an adventure (pretty sure that’s how the story goes), &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; told me to try to learn about and demystify the tech that underlies everything from cryptocurrencies to NFTs. Possibly because my editors want to drive me to the point where I build &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_nTpsv9PNqo?t=20"&gt;an actual red string board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uNVBY"&gt;So, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVXrvnHrW70"&gt;shall we begin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yDJS4C"&gt;What is blockchain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="apGwFJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve read 1,000 analogies trying to explain the blockchain. Could you give me another one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQWXWt"&gt;You can think of a blockchain like an obsessive club filled with members who love to keep track of things. The club has a ton of complicated rules to make sure that every member writes down the exact same set of records about what happens each day (whether it’s bird sightings, or beer tastings, or flower sales) and that once data is recorded and accepted, it becomes exponentially more difficult to change as more and more records are added on top of it. Then, usually, outsiders can come by and check out all their records and go, “Oh, wow, a cardinal flew by at 10AM in front of Mike’s house. Cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTXxfY"&gt;And, of course, there’s an unwritten rule that says you can never stop talking about being in the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6FYcK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzRGxK"&gt;At their core, blockchains let you agree about data with strangers on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evmbqf"&gt;Public blockchains provide a place to put information that anyone can add to, that no one can change, and that isn’t controlled by any single person or entity. (Generally, at least; we’ll deal with the caveats and exceptions later.) Instead of one company or person keeping track of everything, that responsibility is spread out to everyone on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTM6y9"&gt;These properties are often described with very technical-sounding language like “distributed ledger,” “peer-to-peer,” and “cryptographically hashed,” but these are the basic properties that those words describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMfNOv"&gt;We’ll get into the technical side of &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;all that is done a bit later on, but there are probably a few basics we should cover first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBVVEE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKxJAC"&gt;Blocks are what store data on the blockchain — and it’s up to whoever’s making the blockchain to determine what kind of data they store. I could, if I wanted to, create a blockchain where each block stored the entire text of &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;. Would it be efficient? No. Would it be dumb? Yes. Have I done it? Also yes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FXY2p41fEQFGR48Zy7gRhfgoSVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823807/image2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is, in part, what the code behind a rudimentary blockchain looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5y0CeG"&gt;For normal cryptocurrencies, though, blocks contain the records of valid transactions that have taken place on the network. I sent you a MitchellCoin? Put it in a block. You sent me 10 MitchellCoins in return? That’s so kind of you! That’s in the block, too. For cryptocurrencies, you can imagine blocks as boxes of receipts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwY6Mq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nXqkw"&gt;Let’s say I just made a new blockchain: the first block would be there, shiny and new, but lonely. Then, the second block would come along and say, “the block before me is the first block.” The next block would say “the block before me is the second block,” and so on, creating a chain (of blocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEYzIQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello, I’m a blockchain expert, and this is a massive oversimplification. You haven’t mentioned orphaned blocks, block times, forks —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nst4BZ"&gt;Okay yes, blockchain systems are &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;complex, as you’d expect for a system that needs to be able to handle millions of people using it, worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWuhPX"&gt;You definitely could get into galaxy-brain level discussions so thick with jargon that you’d need an entire article just to point you to the proper dictionary, but the extremely basic version is that there are a bunch of blocks that point back to each other in a line. Once a block is made and accepted onto the chain, it can’t be removed without extreme effort. You can only add new blocks. We’ll get into why that is and how the process works in just a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGjSjh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, we’re just talking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies here, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrO9h3"&gt;Well, yes and no. Cryptocurrencies are built using blockchain technology, and they’re by far the most well-known usage of the tech. At this point, you’ve probably heard of at least three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. All three run on their own, separate blockchains, and there’s way more where those came from, just in the cryptocurrency space alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrCUB0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So blockchains are used by people looking to get rich, but Online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRGPzr"&gt;Well, the oodles of money being thrown around is what gets a lot of attention, but blockchain technology isn’t just limited to financial purposes. Technically, anyone can make a blockchain to keep track of anything, so there could really be infinite blockchains. (I even made a very silly one while writing this article.) There are also companies that run their own blockchains, but we’ll get into that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KXvYX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, Mitchell, it’s your mom who, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;as you know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, doesn’t keep up with tech news. Why should I care about blockchain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8DRED"&gt;Hi, mom! Great to talk to you again! How was your kayaking trip? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1YrpP"&gt;People talk about blockchain &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, saying that it’s going to revolutionize everything, and that it could be the next internet. I know you weren’t, as you say, born yesterday, so you can tell that those claims may be just &lt;em&gt;a bit&lt;/em&gt; grandiose. But there is still the possibility of it supporting fascinating new companies, apps, and systems — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;lucrative ones&lt;/a&gt;, at that — and having a basic understanding of the tech will let you know who’s a huckster and who may actually have interesting ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJGSGK"&gt;Or maybe blockchains could accelerate the climate disaster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648278/ida-hurricane-new-orleans-louisiana-climate-change-storm"&gt;destroying the Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhq1dc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0VXS5"&gt;Nah, you don’t really need to worry about that. I’ve been told it’s perfectly fine, and the problem will go away any day now. [Sweating profusely (because of the climate change)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="73ZrT4"&gt;What is blockchain’s impact on climate change?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ahXKqs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still worrying about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk2y8h"&gt;That may be because you’ve seen stories about how some cryptocurrencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682109/bitcoin-energy-consumption-annual-calculation-cambridge-index-cbeci-country-comparison"&gt;use more energy than Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; or Libya, or you’ve heard that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/business/dealbook/bitcoin-climate-change.html"&gt;Bill Gates is worried about them&lt;/a&gt;. There are so many facets to the discussion about crypto’s energy use that would take several articles to cover (though one of my colleagues does have an excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;deep dive into the controversy&lt;/a&gt;), but it is safe to say that blockchains have a reputation for being environmentally unfriendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9aEk9"&gt;Part of the reason for that is a system called “proof of work,” which many blockchains (especially cryptocurrencies) employ for security and trust purposes. If a blockchain uses proof of work to validate blocks, then it requires a lot of computing power to complete transactions. Since computers need energy to run, transactions end up using a lot of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh0MGf"&gt;It is worth noting that it doesn’t have to be this way: blockchains themselves don’t inherently use a ton of energy, and there are alternatives to proof of work. We’ll get into why that is a bit later. But, at the moment anyway, most of the applications of blockchain technology that people are familiar with, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, use proof of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CF4Nq4"&gt;To understand why the proof of work model needs computers to work so hard, we first have to understand how the other parts of blockchain technology operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9owtw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so what does the blockchain look like? Is it a website? An app? An interactive VR experience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upP5db"&gt;Blockchains start out life as a completely empty list, with no information at all. Then, the creators will create something called the Genesis Block, which is just the first block in the chain. Unlike every other block, it doesn’t point back to anything. People can then add information to that list over time — what that information looks like, though, depends on what the blockchain is meant for: if it’s a cryptocurrency blockchain, it’ll be a bunch of transactions. If it’s a blockchain meant for tracking lettuce (which you could do, if you really wanted), it’ll probably look a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCS9pV"&gt;If you had to visualize what a blockchain actually looks like, imagine a bunch of receipts ordered into boxes, which are all tied together. Every so often, a new box is added, containing the receipts that were gathered since the last box was added to the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMmCM8"&gt;In this example, the receipts are transactions, and the boxes are blocks. Managing the transactions as they happen, before they make it on to the blockchain, is a network of computers, commonly called nodes, that are running a special piece of software they use to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oBTwa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the nodes saying?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf2xMH"&gt;Well, when users do any sort of transaction or change, they’re sending out messages to the entire network, for which the nodes are listening. Let’s use a made-up cryptocurrency named, completely randomly, MitchellCoin. If I wanted to send someone five MitchellCoins, I would broadcast that out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffehev"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what’s stopping me from broadcasting out the message that everyone’s given me all their MitchellCoin? Besides my stand-up morals, of course.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uI2ZEl"&gt;When the nodes see messages, they do some checks on it: namely, they’d check to make sure that it was digitally signed by me, to confirm an impersonator isn’t spending my money, and that the message hasn’t been tampered with since I signed it. How the actual signature is made is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s22eJ1eVLTU"&gt;a pretty complex process&lt;/a&gt;, but the end result is a message that is verifiably sent by a specific person — it would be almost impossible to forge (unlike a real signature). This prevents unscrupulous people from falsely claiming that someone else sent them MitchellCoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EIrYs"&gt;Nodes will also check to make sure the transaction is valid (say, by checking I actually have five MitchellCoins to spend, or that the person adding a shipment of lettuce to the blockchain is authorized to do so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plIxuG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uh, is that it? After the node does its verification, the transaction is done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeUObf"&gt;Transactions don’t go through right away. They have to wait for the next block to be added to the chain — a time period that can differ by blockchain. After a block is created and becomes part of the blockchain, all the transactions that are contained in it will become part of the blockchain, too. The process of competing to create that block is known as “mining.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EtLM2"&gt;How the block is mined depends on the model that the blockchain operates on, which we’ll get into in a bit. After a mining node has created a block, it’ll broadcast it out to the world. The other nodes will check to make sure it’s a valid block, then add it to their own ledgers. It’s possible for multiple blocks to be created at once, but eventually the network will end up building more blocks on top of one than the other, making that block part of the official chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vE4Ps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That seems… pretty easy to mess with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Acofe7"&gt;It does, but blockchains have a few features to prevent tampering. To understand how they do that, you have to understand hashing — &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrRzFC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hahahah, blaze it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4CElO"&gt;No, it’s not a weed thing — though the confusion is understandable, given how Bitcoin was, for a time, widely associated with buying drugs on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8RIJW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, why would people buy drugs using a tech where every transaction is publicly available?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMtVsQ"&gt;While the raw data of the Bitcoin blockchain is public, it doesn’t include your personal identifying information (or, at least, it shouldn’t). You will have a unique address to identify you as an entity on the blockchain, because you can’t just say “Hey, I’ve got 15 BTC to spend” without &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way of identifying who you are and how many coins you have, but that doesn’t include data like your name or address. (If any purchase or a pattern of purchases reveals your identity, though, it’s all out in the open.) The most high-profile cases were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/13/7538059/silk-road-trial-ross-ulbricht"&gt;in the early days&lt;/a&gt; before governments started &lt;a href="https://www.cryptovantage.com/guides/know-your-customer/"&gt;regulating cryptocurrency exchanges&lt;/a&gt;, but the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409501/feds-arrest-founder-bitcoin-mixer-laundered-cryptocurrency"&gt;still announces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136749/doj-ohio-helix-bitcoin-darknet-cryptocurrency-laundering-crime"&gt;regular busts&lt;/a&gt; of organizations that try to launder Bitcoin for use in illegal marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYnm8p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Sorry, you were talking about hashing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHQTiZ"&gt;Alright, buckle in — this is going to get complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KSIah"&gt;Hashing is a cryptographic technique that’s been essential to all sorts of computing &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/hans-peter-luhn-and-the-birth-of-the-hashing-algorithm"&gt;since the 1950s and ‘60s&lt;/a&gt;, and blockchains use it to prevent tampering. In blockchains, hashes basically act as unique tags that prevent someone from changing data in a block, or even swapping in a fake block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFcEKa"&gt;Hashing lets you create a string of characters (called the “hash”) from any piece of data. You put a bunch of data in (an entire block) and get a smaller, unique piece of data out (the hash).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj6pXw"&gt;To confirm nothing gets tampered with, each block stores the hash of the block before it. That way, if there’s ever a discrepancy between the two places the hash is stored, you’ll know something’s gone wrong (more accurately, your computer will know — you don’t have to manually check the chain yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4AsGy"&gt; Hashes have a few important properties: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YtRDla"&gt;They will always be the same given the same piece of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bE0RTD"&gt;They will completely change if any part of that data changes, even by the slightest amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j0Qh4H"&gt;It’s very easy to double check that a given hash came from a given piece of data, but very difficult to tell what data was given just from the hash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffqu2y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7IB0z"&gt;Right, let’s do a quick example. Let’s pretend that when we run the word “blockchain” through our hashing algorithm, we get “ef7797” as a result (in reality, hashes are much longer). If we run “blocchain” through, which is only one letter different, we get “8e809e.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBKPbr"&gt;If we wanted to make sure that we’re looking at the same data that was originally hashed, it would be easy as long as we were using the same program to create our hashes. Running “blocchain” through the hashing program will always result in “8e809e,” no matter who’s doing it. But it would take a very long time to go in reverse: if I wanted to know what someone put into the hashing program in order to get “9ed142,” I’d just have to make guesses until I found the specific word that produces that hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQIKZY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still coming up with a lot of weed jokes, but not coming up with how this relates to blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ulm5nu"&gt;Each block in the chain contains within it the hash of the previous block, which is just what the hashing algorithm spits out when given the piece of data that is the block. If anything about that block were to change (say, a transaction in it, or even the entire block itself), the block’s hash would change, breaking the chain: the next block, which contains within it the hash of the previous block would say “Hey, that block pointing to me isn’t the same one that was pointing to me when I was created! Something’s wrong!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFHaWz"&gt;This all adds up to a system where anyone looking at a new block submitted to the chain can tell that nothing has been changed at any point. If it had, the hashes of every block after the change would have to be different than the ledger up to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJaD2u"&gt;By the way, the hashes that blockchain uses are specifically cryptographic hashes. That’s part of the reason for the crypto- prefix that shows up on words like “cryptocurrency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqstv7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think I get it, but could you provide a snazzy illustration just in case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhilBI"&gt;You bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wakUUdpBuOJuXUxPRHnlQAV3eeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823873/acastro_210902_4741_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I6ephx"&gt;So how does everyone agree on which version of the blockchain is correct? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="28vpRV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like how are we checking that these hashes match up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xfhwyy"&gt;The exact answer depends on what blockchain you’re talking about, but each one has something called a “consensus algorithm.” Basically, each blockchain decides how it wants to decide what the canonical truth is — generally, it’s based on the chain that has had the most work put into it. In a proof-of-work based blockchain, that means the chain with the most blocks: since every block requires work to mine, the longest chain will be the one with the most work put into it and will therefore be the official chain. (There are some alternative ways of doing it, however, which we’ll touch on later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nylnKz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I wanted to attack this? Like if I spent 5,000 MitchellCoins, how would I change the record to say that I still had those coins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3d4ta"&gt;It would be extremely painful (for your computer, that is). So first what you’d have to do is change the block where that happened. You’d then have to recompute the hash for that block, and every block that came after… And you’d not only have to do that on one computer (which would be hard enough, for reasons we’ll go into in a second), but on enough computers to drown out everyone else who was mining legitimately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oppqgs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds very hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPBI5Z"&gt;That’s the point. That’s how you can have these things exist in public, yet still be reasonably sure that no one is messing with the record. Attacks can and do happen, but when so much computing power is required to pull one off, it’s hard to do without someone noticing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeiwQm"&gt;The math changes, however, if there are very few people mining a particular coin. If MitchellCoin were a real thing, and only a few people were mining it on their home computers, it wouldn’t be that hard, or that expensive, for someone to amass 51 percent of the computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5tuK4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The word “blockchain” is starting to feel fake…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBgkTJ"&gt;Ah, that would be the semantic satiation kicking in. That’s the name for the feeling where you’ve heard a word so many times that it loses all meaning. It’s not surprising, given how many times I’ve used the word “blockchain” here. Let’s do it a few more times, just to make sure: blockchain blockchain blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B5USe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So wait, how does this come together to actually make a block?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTlypZ"&gt;Well, when two nodes love each other very much…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laPGGG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4HdsV"&gt;Sorry. So how a block gets made, or “mined” depends on the blockchain itself. One of the most popular systems is called “proof of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pwyimw"&gt;Proof of work systems are… complex, but we’ve already covered most of what we need to know to understand them. Basically, the blockchain will have certain rules for what it wants hashes to look like for blocks. Let’s say, for instance, that the MitchellCoin blockchain requires the first five characters of the hash to all be the letter a (so that it’s constantly screaming, like I am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaIsnj"&gt;When a mining node wants to create a block, it would take all the data in the block, plus a special number called a nonce, and run it through the hashing algorithm. If the hash doesn’t start out as “aaaaa,” it would increase the nonce by one, and start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcDv6T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So basically, your computer is just… guessing numbers until it gets to the hash it wants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UJgHz"&gt;Pretty much, yeah. And the hashes are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; — I’ve been using just a couple of characters as examples, but in general the hashes are 60+ characters long. On average, your computer will have to make a ton of guesses before it finds one that meets the criteria. But, again, while it takes us a long time to figure out an appropriate hash, it takes almost no time at all to check to make sure that our data actually does hash out to what we say it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkN1Nd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, it’s me, your computer that’s mining for crypto. Why are you making me work so haaarrrddd?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ6D9V"&gt;Oh no, the AI revolution has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDxqA3"&gt;But really, the difficulty is an important part of the system, because it dictates the security of the block, as well as defining how blocks are made. As we noted before, if you wanted to change a record, you’d both have to recompute the hash for both the block and each subsequent block, as well as win the right to mine each of those blocks. The same is also true for double spends, which is where you try to undo a transaction so you can spend those coins again. The odds of you being able to double spend coins, and then create enough blocks afterward to make a chain long enough to be recognized as legitimate aren’t great. And, if you have enough computing power to tilt those odds in your favor, it’d likely be more profitable to just mine legitimate blocks instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYHhL0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So getting back to the energy thing…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKWMxM"&gt;Right, so when you’re creating, or mining, blocks each guess you make takes time and electricity, whether it’s right or not. And that adds up. But, as mentioned before, that’s what makes the blockchain secure — it would take a lot of time and energy to rewrite the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFf4FI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like blockchains are really dumb and wasteful then! Throw them in the trash!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4aE6l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[chanting] Trash! Trash! Trash! Trash!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnr6QX"&gt;Well the good news is that, while proof of work may be popular, it’s not the only way to do things. There’s also proof of stake systems, where, instead of solving puzzles, people put up crypto as a collateral to get a chance at being the next person to mine a block and be asked to validate blocks mined by others. If they validate malicious blocks, they’ll lose some or all of that money, depending on the blockchain’s rules. Proof of stake blockchains require way less energy, because mining a block doesn’t require making millions of guesses — those with stakes are randomly or algorithmically chosen to create a block, and they won’t need specialized, ultra-powerful hardware to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkXOpL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If proof of stake makes it easy to mine, what would keep people from wanting to mess with it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezjkPC"&gt;Well, an argument for proof of stake is that it incentivizes miners to actually care about the currency, since they have to be &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp"&gt;HODL&lt;/a&gt;ers. Messing with the blockchain would likely reduce confidence in it — making it, and your stake, less valuable. This is in contrast to proof of work miners, who could immediately sell their coins and keep on mining without having to worry too much about the value or stability of the currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x0TGm"&gt;There have been talks of moving to proof of stake, especially on the Ethereum blockchain for a while, but the upgrade is &lt;a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/"&gt;still in a very early stage&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting, though, that blockchains don’t necessarily have to use proof of work &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; proof of stake — there are other &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-trying-build-better-blockchain/"&gt;alternative consensus algorithms&lt;/a&gt; as well, and blockchains that aren’t public or used for currencies can create blocks in completely different ways that are way more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iT54JW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think my brain has kind of melted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5lcXC"&gt;Yeah, as I said it’s a pretty complex system. The good news is that, if you want to use the blockchain, you don’t actually have to know exactly how the system works — just like you don’t have to know how the banking system works to be able to swipe a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7q4nQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of credit cards, hold on a moment. I think I lost my wallet, I could swear I put it somewhere…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brLCZk"&gt;That sounds annoying, but imagine if you had a wallet that you could not only lose, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;forget the password to as well&lt;/a&gt;. Remind me to talk about how those work sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPHnkF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ah, I found it. Okay, back to the blockchain. Can I just trust anything that’s on it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fi33M"&gt;Oh, no, I wouldn’t recommend that at all. The blockchain provides a way to verify, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the data you’re looking at hasn’t been altered. But it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; do much to help you determine whether the data was true when it was entered. There are private enterprise blockchains where every user is known and has specific permissions, but public blockchains are an entirely different beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eURPIm"&gt;For example, say I wanted to sell space rocks and claimed to prove their authenticity using blockchain technology. Even if I figured out a way to provide certificates of authenticity that lived on the blockchain and were indisputably tied to the physical rock I sent you, the blockchain wouldn’t do anything to help you if the “space rock” was actually just a pebble I got from my backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Itunnz"&gt;(Please note: I completely made this up as an example. Any resemblance to someone running a scam with blockchain and space rocks is purely coincidental. Also, if you are doing that… don’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOxtRN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are blockchains just useful for cryptocurrency? Or are there other uses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1NXeee"&gt;While cryptocurrencies obviously get all the hype and coverage, there’s tons of experimentation being done with blockchains in a bunch of different fields. Walmart &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/business/walmart-blockchain-lettuce.html"&gt;has used the blockchain to track produce&lt;/a&gt; from the farm to its stores (and provide easy accountability if there’s a disease outbreak); there are experiments in creating and selling &lt;a href="https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-domains-what-are-they-and-how-are-they-implemented-hi2b30hu"&gt;web addresses, or domains&lt;/a&gt;, on top of the blockchain; and there was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cryptocurrency-technology-finds-new-use-tackling-coronavirus-11587675966"&gt;talk at the beginning of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; about tracking supplies and COVID-19 immunity using the blockchain. It does, though, remain to be seen if any of these systems actually catch on and become essential, or if they end up like all those businesses that sprung up in the mid-2010s that said they would use the blockchain without any real idea of what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct2vsh"&gt;There are also, of course, NFTs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG5KhS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pointing-rick-dalton"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recognize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; NFTs! Those are on the blockchain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGJgQt"&gt;They are! Many NFTs exist on the Ethereum blockchain, which has specific features that allow for them. Yes, that does mean that you can do multiple things at once on a single blockchain — it just depends on how the data is set up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58VcQB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you marry me on the blockchain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSxO3y"&gt;Wow, forward. Uh, no, but there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364647/coinbase-employees-nft-wedding-exchange-romance"&gt;people who have made NFT wedding rings&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, you should probably make sure your partner (who I will reiterate is not me) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redditships/status/1432396694608662536?s=20"&gt;is into that before trying it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sts4wJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aw, okay. Well, will blockchain revolutionize voting / currency / inventory systems / news?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4VIFS"&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; blockchain boosters who like to say that the tech is the future of everything, and that it’ll be as big as the internet. However, as with anyone who’s telling you how great something they’re deeply invested in is, you should probably take what they say with 0.001 Saltcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLg7rq"&gt;If a space would benefit in some way from being decentralized, or if everyone needs to share a known-truthful record, then yes, there is a chance blockchain could be a future tech. But if not, then there’s not a ton of benefit to using the technology over, say, a regular database. Blockchains are just a tool like any other — one of IBM’s fellows told me that when it creates blockchains for enterprises, the blockchain is really a small part of a larger IT system that also involves things like databases and other legacy programs. In other words, most of the time companies aren’t just throwing out their old systems and moving to blockchains, they’re integrating them in a way that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rMPiiY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard explaining how even relatively simple voting systems are trustworthy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmIXRO"&gt;As for voting specifically? Well, there’s certainly some interest in that area — a bill &lt;a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2021/04/15/alaska-would-be-first-state-to-use-blockchain-based-voting-system-under-proposed-bill/"&gt;proposed in Alaska&lt;/a&gt; looks to move the state’s voting system to the blockchain, and a few other places have experimented with the idea. But at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136219/voatz-blockchain-voting-app-election-software-hacking-mit-research-cybersecurity"&gt;one early effort&lt;/a&gt; has shown the increased risks that come with applying new and perhaps unneeded tech to voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7VW02"&gt;For my part, I tend to agree &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs"&gt;with educational YouTuber Tom Scott&lt;/a&gt; on the matter of voting systems using blockchain to do electronic voting — even if the blockchain made voting completely trustworthy (which wouldn’t necessarily be the case), you also have to prove to the general public &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;it’s trustworthy. As 2020 showed, that can be hard to do with low-tech systems, much less ones that require explainers that are, like, a million words long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXDhfa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honestly, this all really sounds like something I’d like to watch an animated TV show about. Maybe from one of the people behind &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiC8M"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441078/fox-blockchain-animated-series-dan-harmon-nft"&gt;I have good news for you...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh49TE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I’d only be interested in it if it had an obvious blockchain-based cash grab tie-in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjKOOo"&gt;I have &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/dan-harmon-blockchain-nft-crypto-series-fox-1234954403/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;good news for you&lt;/a&gt; (and bad news for everyone with… taste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNtNze"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to put something on the blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL8lF7"&gt;So it’s actually not a ton of work to make your own blockchain from scratch. There’s some coding involved, to be sure, but it’s honestly not anything that couldn’t be figured out with a few days of research (and some basic programming knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxDeDP"&gt;There’s also no rule that says you have to create your own blockchain — some blockchains, like Ethereum, let you build on top of them, allowing you to take advantage of blockchain technology without having to create your own network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKQ2ph"&gt;But the biggest question you should ask yourself before diving into any of that is, of course: does my thing &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;need to be on the blockchain? Am I trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, potentially using way more energy than is necessary for my application?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="170Kuw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I really need my thing to run on the blockchain! The fate of nations depends on it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFUYPR"&gt;It’s definitely possible that you’re working on a specific problem that just needs blockchain technology! But if it’s that important then, uh, you really shouldn’t just be learning all this! I wish you the best of luck, though — see you on the ‘chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKfVap"&gt;(By the way, no one says “see you on the ‘chain.” That was a test to see if you’re truly laser eyes enough.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvlh1q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laser eyes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm98e5"&gt;Nope, sorry. This has been long enough, we’ll have to get into that elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DnScD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xiNoLa"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823875/acastro_210902_4741_still.jpg" alt="Illustration of blocks falling into place."&gt;&lt;video src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/3df0ccbd1ae3bee2d74228aae719aab3/acastro_210902_4741_0001.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>Google Photos will now ship individual prints directly to your door</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XD-NVeRNyrMjUvZU1EW_WDZpRQo=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833266/Rd4_Opt2_GooglePhotos_Aug20201041_7Si2Fgt.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t7IO4U"&gt;Google Photos now lets you order prints of specific photographs and get them shipped to homes in the US for as little as $0.18 plus shipping, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/all-ways-print-your-memories-google-photos/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Although it’s previously been possible to print individual photos through Google Photos, until now you’ve had to pick them up from a local Walmart, CVS, or Walgreens. Otherwise, getting prints shipped has required paying for Google’s $6.99 a month photo subscription, which sends 10 cardstock photo prints each month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS06AN"&gt;Alongside the new shipping option, Google is also expanding the sizes available. There’s now the option of getting prints in larger 11x14, 12x18, 16x20, and 20x30-inch sizes, in addition to the previously available 4x6, 5x7 or 8x10-inch options. Canvas prints, which were already available with shipping, are also getting new 8x10, 16x16, 20x30, 24x36, 30x40, and 36x36-inch sizes, which will sit alongside the existing 8x8, 11x14, and 16x20-inch selection.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will let you control an Xbox with a TV remote soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwm5KKf80Hjzi5adj68USg-5o7w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833242/vpavic_4275_20201030_0033.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yHkI7b"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test the ability for TV remotes to navigate around the Xbox dashboard. A new version of the Xbox dashboard for Xbox Series S / X consoles is being tested with selected Xbox Insiders, and it enables new HDMI-CEC features that let ordinary TV remote controls navigate around the Xbox dashboard and control streaming apps like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZ7uaf"&gt;While the Xbox Series S / X consoles have had some HDMI-CEC features to control TV volume or turn on TVs when an Xbox boots up, these new additions mean you won’t have to reach for an Xbox controller if you just want to watch content from Netflix, Twitch, YouTube, or many other streaming apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FdN1UL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;these are the new Xbox controls in the dashboard &lt;a href="https://t.co/eY7HG8713i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eY7HG8713i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1435734530078429189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WArVjk"&gt;The new HDMI-CEC features also include an option to enable your TV to switch input to your Xbox simply by pressing the Xbox button on a controller. You may already have a TV remote that can control your Xbox using infrared commands, but the addition of HDMI-CEC control should make input switching more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leri4u"&gt;The new options can be found in the HDMI-CEC settings part of the Xbox dashboard, and are currently available to testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha Xbox Insider rings. We’d expect these new features to rollout to all Xbox Series S / X consoles in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8eBwS"&gt;Microsoft is also currently testing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318050/microsoft-edge-xbox-chromium-browser-testing"&gt;new version of the Edge browser&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613617/microsoft-xbox-night-mode-feature-dim-screen-controller-led"&gt;Xbox night mode feature&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627478/microsoft-xbox-series-x-4k-dashboard-update-features"&gt;higher resolution dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, and improved firmware and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663039/microsoft-xbox-controller-firmware-dynamic-latency-input-dli-bluetooth-low-energy"&gt;features for older Xbox One controllers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Ray-Ban’s smart glasses leak before launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIcedLbTPnsi0favZG2LsSDrscI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69833151/stories.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWZ1nQ"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban are set to announce their smart glasses collaboration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661109/facebook-ray-ban-luxottica-smart-glasses-teaser"&gt;later today&lt;/a&gt;, September 9th, and right on cue Evan “Evleaks” Blass has &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/evleaks/status/1435831766418341891"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a ton of alleged photos of the product lineup. The glasses are called Ray-Ban Stories, and other than the box it doesn’t look like Facebook branding appears anywhere on the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjaR20"&gt;Evleaks’ images include three distinct frame styles — Wayfarer, Round, and Meteor — and they all look pretty close to the classic Ray-Ban designs. The difference, of course, is the presence of two cameras by the hinges on either side. There’s also a button along the top of the right temple, which could potentially be used to operate the cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jWVMsf4XUXY9ZkgNMTeTrQEHfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836362/E_0Yb_oXoAAAZqc.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ego693"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599599/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-next-product-launch-specs"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of the glasses that they “have [Ray-Ban’s] iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.” They don’t have screens for AR functionality, however, so we’re still in the dark about what those things might be. Zuckerberg said that the product is part of the company’s “journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future,” and more advanced AR glasses are also in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qPBEI"&gt;For now, these pictures don’t do much to show how or whether Facebook has leapt beyond the capabilities of even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13671164/snapchat-spectacles-glasses-review-camera-sunglasses"&gt;Snap’s early Spectacles&lt;/a&gt; — other than by making glasses that look like regular Ray-Bans, of course. We’ll hopefully have the answer to that question later today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iRobot’s newest Roomba uses AI to avoid dog poop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RfHKlkczb-UOVij3gGUr0eQLvtA=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832964/Roomba_j7_j7__Object_Detection_Pet_Waste.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dog poop avoiding feature is only available on the new Roomba j7+. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: iRobot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUY6vx"&gt;Using a robot vacuum has always been a bit hazardous for pet owners. Leaving a robovac to do its thing in your absence can be a problem if your less-than-perfectly-trained dog or cat also does &lt;em&gt;its &lt;/em&gt;thing while you’re out. A quick Google of “&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Roomba+dog+poop"&gt;Roomba dog poop&lt;/a&gt;” gives you some idea of what the outcome can be, as unheeding robots with spinning brushes barrel into the mess and proceed to spread it liberally around the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R55cEK"&gt;But now, Roomba-maker iRobot say it’s fixed this scatological problem. The company’s latest robovac, the Roomba j7+, uses built-in machine vision and AI to identify and avoid pet messes of all sorts. “It’s a big deal for us,” iRobot founder and CEO Colin Angle tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’ve been working on it for a long time and we’re &lt;em&gt;guaranteeing&lt;/em&gt; that it works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="maeHwn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’re &lt;em&gt;guaranteeing&lt;/em&gt; that it works”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k2Hiq4"&gt;This last point is particularly important. Competing robovacs like the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/review/roborock-s6-maxv-robot-vacuum"&gt;Roborock S6 MaxV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/robot-vacuum-uses-triple-lidar-avoid-dog-poop/"&gt;360 Smart Life robot vacuum&lt;/a&gt; advertise the same mess-avoiding capabilities, but Angle is skeptical that they’re fully reliable. He says iRobot has been working on the problem for years, even creating a huge database of fake pet mess to train their AI vision systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3TZdw"&gt;“Robotics is supposed to be glamorous, but I don’t know how many Play-Doh models of poo we created,” says Angle. “Many, many thousands.” The result, though, is unwavering confidence in the company’s poop-identifying capabilities. “Our competition are starting to claim that they do this, too, but it’s more like [they do it] at CES with the right lighting,” he says. “We felt the need to really put a line in the sand and say, this is real, it’s not a gimmick. If you have a pet we’re not going to let you down here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R9d8iT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10738679"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="McGx0U"&gt;The fact that avoiding dog mess is the headline feature of iRobot’s latest robot vacuum cleaner gives some suggestion about the problems and progress with these machines. They’ve certainly become more efficient and useful over the years, but there are still some basic teething problems that show up when the rubber hits the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9jTVXG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An upgrade to iRobot’s Genius software offers new cleaning modes and features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdcVxe"&gt;iRobot is hoping to fix some of these with an update to its navigation and control software, known as iRobot Genius. This was initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21377585/irobot-ai-software-update-home-intelligence-genius-app"&gt;launched in August last year&lt;/a&gt; for compatible Roombas, and it not only maps users’ homes to allow for more granular cleaning instructions, but uses built-in machine vision to identify furniture and specific “clean zones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwQzjT"&gt;Version 3.0 of iRobot Genius, which launches today as a free upgrade, adds a number of new features. These include a “Quiet Drive” mode which stops the robot from making a noise when heading to and from cleaning jobs; cleaning time estimates for specific rooms; improved mapping capabilities, including suggested room names based on the robot’s ability to identify items of furniture; and a new “Clean While I’m Away” function. This means, if people like, they can allow iRobot access to their phone location, and whenever they leave the house it will trigger a cleaning session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DGEOzP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10738678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jMQQ4s"&gt;The biggest update, though, is only for the new Roomba j7+ which uses a new camera to identify not only dog mess but other hazardous obstacles, like socks, shoes, and headphones. Again, this is done using onboard machine vision, but it does require some action on the part of the owner. If the Roomba finds an unexpected obstacle, it’ll ask via the connected app whether it’s a temporary or permanent fixture. If it’s permanent (like dangling TV cables), then the machine will automatically create a no-clean zone for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbEALR"&gt;As Angle explains, it’s all about making iRobot’s products feel “like a partner” rather than a tool — trusted services that can anticipate owners’ wishes. “The idea is, we know what time it is, we know where we are in the home, and we have an idea of the floor plan in rooms,” he says. “We should start applying respectful rules to our technology and holding our technology to the same types of accountability that we hold each other to in the home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZfeXc"&gt;It’s also how the company wants to differentiate itself from cheaper competitors. The new Roomba j7+ costs $849 with a base station that holds up to 60 days’ worth of dirt, which is many multiples compared to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/robot-vacuum/s?k=robot+vacuum"&gt;the price tag of basic robovacs&lt;/a&gt;. Angle says iRobot’s free software upgrades, now and in the future, should help persuade customers to choose them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY5uzh"&gt;In addition to the features listed above, the new Roomba j7+ also has a new high-end design, a simplified control system (three buttons instead of one), Bluetooth LE capability to simplify onboarding, and a new beveled rim that’s supposed to stop the machine from getting stuck under cabinets and refrigerators. The Roomba j7+ goes on sale today in the US and Canada from iRobot’s website and will be available for purchase at selected retailers from September 19th. It can also be bought without the cleaning base station for $649.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12’s last beta brings a few makeovers and new widgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYauF0PVHqYrRgj75ABSKpm_oUQ=/0x472:1080x1192/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832549/Screenshot_20210908_173434.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xSzYjT"&gt;Today, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661647/android-12-final-beta-5-pixel-5a-stability-ui-changes-preview"&gt;released the final Android 12 beta&lt;/a&gt; before the OS properly launches, and with it a few of the visual changes and features we saw back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;when Android 12 was announced&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the notable inclusions in Beta 5 are the lovely geometric clock widgets, a redesigned calculator, and a new lock screen shortcut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Teo8Db"&gt;The clock app has also gotten some tweaks, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/08/google-clock-material-you-android-12-beta-5/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with an updated design, new animations, and (of course) colors that are responsive to your phone’s theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hzKaY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10742007"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1JtJVF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/08/google-calculator-8-0-brings-material-you-redesign-gallery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; that Beta 5 brings the promised Material You overhaul for the calculator app as well, complete with pastel colors and more playful buttons. Here’s new vs. old:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xWoSK12GXAy8uQPhtt2qUhYF4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835822/Screen_Shot_2021_09_08_at_4.58.56_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new design of Calculator 8.0 in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w15OlTUVCMqM-4yGfVrDCRS-vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835831/image000000.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old design of the built-in calculator found in Android 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3CHfj6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-beta-5-changelog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that the lock screen has a new device control shortcut that lets you control smart home devices with the tap of a button once you’ve woken your phone’s screen up. The device controls had already moved from Android 11’s power menu into the quick settings shade, but now they’re available in another, more convenient place. The button joins the Google Wallet shortcut that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/09/android-12-beta-2-wallet-toggle-comes-to-lock-screen-for-even-faster-nfc-payments/"&gt;showed up on the lock screen in Beta 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78o77H"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/08/on-android-12-beta-5-the-pixel-launchers-search-bar-can-find-almost-anything/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Pixel owners running the beta now have access to a new and improved search bar. For whatever you type in, it’ll show matching settings, contacts, and more, in addition to the app and Google results that the bar used to retrieve. We’d seen &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/13/android-12-beta-4-reveals-more-changes-for-enhanced-search-bar-functionality/"&gt;hints of this feature in previous betas&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of setting screens and APIs, but now it’s something you can actually use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDAhve"&gt;For some of the smaller tweaks that have shown up in Beta 5, you can read &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/08/android-12-beta-5-new-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-beta-5-changelog/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s complete roundups. Or, if you’d like to see the changes for yourself and have a supported device, you can follow our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442576/android-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update"&gt;guide on how to install the beta here&lt;/a&gt;. Do be warned that while the OS is set to be released “in a few weeks,” it may still have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswelch/status/1435677605802487810?s=20"&gt;a few rough edges here or there&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fraud, or just a failure? Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes’s trial opening arguments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTWHGsASAb0nnSeAiPZDgZjttws=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832361/1235132920.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, outside the courtroom | David Odisho / Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Who is Elizabeth Holmes, really?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lpIvYu"&gt;Would you rather be a failure or a fraud? Judging by the opening statements in Elizabeth Holmes’ wire fraud trial, those seem to be Holmes’ options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3gEN4"&gt;Here’s Robert Leach, assistant U.S. attorney, who is prosecuting the case against Holmes: “This is a case about fraud, about lying and cheating to get money,” Leach says. “That’s a crime on Main Street and a crime in Silicon Valley.” But according to Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, Holmes is just another failed startup leader: “In the end, Theranos failed. And Ms. Holmes walked away with nothing. But failure is not a crime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xPJP8I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="819WPU"&gt;Now, by the time the first day of the trial ended, the first witness had only just been introduced. There are plenty more witnesses and apparently just a whole fuckload of documents ahead of us. But my impression is that the prosecution is going to have an uphill battle to show Holmes’ &lt;em&gt;intent to deceive, &lt;/em&gt;a crucial part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh3Hw4"&gt;According to the government, Theranos didn’t start life as a fraud, so that’s nice. Instead, in 2009, Holmes was rapidly running out of money. Worse, things with its pharma partners weren’t going so well — Pfizer and Schering-Plough, two huge drug companies, had cut it loose. Theranos was having a hard time making payroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="448cDt"&gt;“Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie,” Leach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxvHYA"&gt;So Holmes started seeking investments, making the kind of grandiose startup claims we’re all familiar with from the tech industry. (Theranos was a medical company, but never mind.) Holmes gave revenue projections to Safeway that overestimated what Theranos could achieve, and gave Walgreens a report that suggested Pfizer had endorsed their tech. Leach’s allegations about a Pfizer memo that had been shown to investors were astonishing. See, according to him, it was forged. Pfizer’s letterhead might have been on the memo but Pfizer didn’t put it there. I expect we’ll be hearing from Pfizer about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Es5ZTK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes’ own brother, who she’d hired, told her that Theranos’ pregnancy tests had problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4vboHO"&gt;Other allegations from Leach included that Holmes misled investors about Theranos’ relationship with the military — claiming that the company’s mini analyzer was deployed in military helicopters, and saving lives, when its only relationship with the military was a small 2010 study at the Army burn center in Texas. According to Leach, Holmes also deceived investors about the readiness of the analyzer. And! Despite having zero revenue in 2012 and 2013, Holmes went around telling investors that revenue would be $140 million in 2014. (It was actually $150,000.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NppExY"&gt;We’re going to be hearing from some former Theranos employees who tried to tell Holmes and Balwani that the analyzers weren’t working as promised. One of them was fired. The other was ignored. And when Holmes’ own brother, who she’d hired, told her that Theranos’ pregnancy tests had problems, she ignored him. Leach promised the jury would see “email after email” showing that Holmes was aware of the problems — but unlike the Pfizer memo, we didn’t see any specific emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZNED3"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes’ media persona&lt;/a&gt; made an appearance as well. According to Leach, favorable press coverage was a major way that Holmes was able to raise money — saying she “approved” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"&gt;this glowing &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; and timed up a press release with it meant to lure investors. He also said that &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; contained lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq9BOf"&gt;But those pieces do contain some truths, Leach said. Holmes was in full control of Theranos. “She owned it, she controlled it, the buck stopped with her,” Leach said. “She sweated the details. She was in charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="smEgFX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trusting and relying on Balwani as her primary advisor was one of her mistakes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEhKqk"&gt;While the prosecution was specific, the defense was playing for sympathy. Wade opened by telling us about Holmes packing up her belongings into her car after Theranos went under. Then he took us back in time to Holmes dropping out of college at 19, after patenting a miniaturized system that would perform tests and give a result. According to Wade, Holmes’ co-defendant who is being tried separately, Sunny Balwani, encouraged her to drop out. “Trusting and relying on Balwani as her primary advisor was one of her mistakes,” Wade says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0EYjA"&gt;In Wade’s telling, Holmes was a wide-eyed naif — and nothing was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; her fault. See, Balwani was responsible for the clinical labs where things were going wrong for patients, and financial modeling was also his job. Walgreens and Safeway pressured Holmes into marketing herself. So, at the suggestion of a board member, she hired marketing firm &lt;a href="https://www.tbwachiatday.com/"&gt;Chiat Day&lt;/a&gt;. (Not much mention was made of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius&lt;/a&gt;, thought we did see an ad about Theranos’ inexpensive testing.) Also, Walgreens pushed Holmes into agreeing to a phased approach to testing — Theranos hadn’t duped it into thinking it was using its own machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i9Ca0"&gt;Oh, and the inaccurate results? Sure, that can happen in any lab, Wade said. Holmes believed the tests were accurate and reliable and used them herself, as well as recommending them to her family. &lt;em&gt;Balwani&lt;/em&gt; had oversight of the labs, and besides, the lab directors are legally responsible for safe and accurate testing, not Holmes. Some of those lab directors are going to testify and I am &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;interested to hear what they have to say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nI7de6"&gt;And although &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;two years’ worth of Theranos’ tests were thrown out&lt;/a&gt;, Wade argued that we’ll be hearing from only &lt;em&gt;20&lt;/em&gt; patients and doctors who got bad results — when 8 million tests were performed. (Wade did not bring up the tests that had been voided.) Just 20 out of 8 million is an awfully small number of inaccurate tests, Wade said. He even did some showy math for the jury: that’s 0.00025 percent of all tests. This suggests that Theranos’s tests were actually very accurate and that the prosecution is cherry-picking — but it leaves out those voided tests. That is an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; omission! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mABrTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Wade is to be believed, Holmes is responsible for almost nothing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFhE7"&gt;As further evidence that Holmes believed in Theranos, Wade announced that Holmes hadn’t sold any of her shares. “She passed on every opportunity to sell,” he said. She could have made hundreds of millions of dollars, but she was in it for the mission, not money, he said. Now, it’s kind of hard to sell shares of a private company — not impossible! — but I don’t know what kind of agreements might have been in place about her ownership stake. After the omission about the two years’ worth of tests getting shitcanned, I don’t buy much of what Wade is selling. What else is he leaving out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVzrSL"&gt;If Wade is to be believed, Holmes is responsible for almost nothing. She was young, after all, and a college dropout. She worked seven days a week at Theranos but somehow could not possibly be responsible for anything except her dream of success. And while Wade hinted at the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmes-might-claim-abusive-relationship-in-criminal-fraud-defense-11630167496"&gt;abuse allegations Holmes made about Balwani&lt;/a&gt; — he “sometimes had a temper, could lash out, did not always treat people kindly” and in Holmes’ relationship with him, “there was another side to it that most people never saw” — he never directly argued that abuse was a factor in Holmes’ actions. I’m guessing this is because having Holmes take the stand is a risky move, and if the case hangs on the abuse allegations, she’ll have to testify to the abuse. After all, most people didn’t even know the two of them were in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="c5uh0e"&gt;This trial is just beginning, and a lot hinges on the testimony we haven’t yet heard and emails we haven’t yet seen. But the outlines of the story each side is telling are clear. For the prosecution, proving that Holmes isn’t a dimwitted figurehead might be tough — the standard, after all, is “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and Wade hammered hard on the presumption of innocence. Okay. But with so much blame being shifted to Balwani, the question arises: if the defense really wants to argue this is merely the story of failure due to naïveté, then what exactly &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;Elizabeth Holmes doing at Theranos? She was apparently breaking her back there &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt; for fifteen years! Wade suggested she was primarily working on the tests and making bad decisions, but surely if that were all she was doing, she probably could have taken some weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf Hyper review: where the rubber meets the foam </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmPpxrAML7IYH-Ve7WbGOxouhSw=/0x93:2200x1560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832260/verge_sean_hollister_20210822_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nerf Hyper Rush-40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Are these new blasters really the future of Nerf?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8Nmuu2"&gt;For nearly 30 years, Nerf has been synonymous with foam — foam balls, foam darts, and foam arrows blasted across playgrounds or over cubicle walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B0sid"&gt;For its new awesome-looking Hyper blasters, Nerf brand owner Hasbro had something different in mind. To increase their performance and capacity, it charged a small team of engineers to develop a smaller projectile using a new material. They came up with a tiny ball made of thermoplastic elastomer; effectively, rubber instead of foam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXedXj"&gt;Before they could perfect that ball, the company’s designers had to build a new set of blasters to actually fire those projectiles, too. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-HF-Blaster/dp/B083QZPGX9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The $30 Hyper Rush-40&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-Pump-Action/dp/B083QZK786/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 Siege-50&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-SMG-Blaster/dp/B083QZLSZ5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 Mach-100&lt;/a&gt; were developed at the same time as the new rounds, they told me on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSTraO"&gt;That might be why they don’t work particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hr8LD"&gt;I’ve been testing them in my local park, my backyard, and this past month, I got to try them at an actual Nerf war. Honestly, I can’t recommend them at all. And I’m still not sure whether it’s because the ammo has fundamental limitations, or whether this first wave of blasters just misses the mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVss73"&gt;Let’s discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7IL4B3gKI29S1FtlRHjcCLCvNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835515/verge_sean_hollister_20210822_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top to bottom: Rush-40, Siege-50, Mach-100.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gg26Rd"&gt;Dream vs. reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4z5zSQ"&gt;When I was a kid, you’d have to reload most Nerf blasters after every single shot. Only the biggest, bulkiest and most inaccurate two-handed toys let you do more. When I returned to Nerf as an adult, a five-shot revolver you could prime with your thumb was a revelation, and yet you’d still have to carry a bulky drum magazine to feed a rifle with more than 18 darts at a time. It was only 2017 when the company finally released &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Rival-Nemesis-MXVII-10K-Red/dp/B01MG5QHC1/ref=asc_df_B01MG5QHC1/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=241949400705&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18065931603132406381&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-406502453996&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $100 blaster&lt;/a&gt; that could fit enough ammo to hold down a fort thanks to a gigantic hopper-fed system that held 100 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDR9b"&gt;So when Nerf announced its new Hyper ammo was small enough to cram 40 shots into a pistol or 100 into an SMG-sized blaster, plus paintball-style canisters to top up, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Rival-Nemesis-MXVII-10K-Red/dp/B01MG5QHC1/ref=asc_df_B01MG5QHC1/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=241949400705&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18065931603132406381&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-406502453996&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it sounded like a dream&lt;/a&gt;: we’d finally be able to battle without constantly thinking about the next reload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KdlrE"&gt;Instead, I’m constantly thinking about whether my blaster will actually shoot when I pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k9YOaqEeIjjUbi-uvSmjIlPsp34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835611/verge_sean_hollister_20210907.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To prime the spring-powered Rush-40, you pull back on the entire slide, hopper and all. But you’ll have to point it down first. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAzvKk"&gt;Whether you pick the Rush-40, Siege-50 or Mach-100, their integrated ammo boxes all rely on gravity to feed rounds into the chamber, and these rounds don’t always want to go in. If you actually stuff 40 tiny yellow balls into a Rush-40, or 50 of them into a Siege-50, they might not have enough room to reach the chute at all. Even if you don’t, they need to slide down the slope just right to reach the inner chamber. Mess it up, and nothing will happen when you pull the trigger, just a puff of air. So far, my best bet has been to point the blaster down to the ground each time I prime it — but that means not keeping it aimed at my target. It’s a real disadvantage in a fast-paced Nerf battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JmNcb"&gt;Even with the Mach-100, which has a dedicated mechanical agitator and conveyor belt to keep the balls moving, it can be a problem: the supposedly full-auto blaster would often pop just a few balls at a time, then pause, then fart out two at once, sometimes with dramatically reduced range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_OxRfNJFgLzNmT4mvvNXDEYjacw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835554/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike the Rival Perses with its lightweight rechargeable pack, the similar Hyper Mach-100 requires 6 D batteries. I wouldn’t want to hold it this way for long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vdGYQb"&gt;And even when they do fire, you can’t expect them to go anywhere near where their blaster’s built-in aiming sights are pointed. With the Rush-40 pistol and Mach-100 SMG in particular, their shots almost immediately curve right down to the ground, forcing you to aim much higher than your target and rain balls down. I did get some tags this way, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imtUeo"&gt;It also mystifies me why Hasbro produced paintball-like hoppers and pods for easy refills without giving them a way to mate. Every time I whip out one of the cool canisters, which smartly attach to each blaster’s built-in rails, I inevitably dump a bunch of them on the ground, because the loading doors and flip-top canister don’t match up at all. Hasbro designer Rob Maschin says the team would love to change that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYOFAC"&gt;This is all a shame, because in many ways these Hyper balls are the best projectiles Nerf’s made in years. While they’re the same dimpled shape as the company’s larger foam Rival balls, the new TPE rounds are far denser and fly further. They’re &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaA_xTaRa7I"&gt;easy to wash&lt;/a&gt;, not terribly hard to pick up with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-Weasel-Small-Nut-Gatherer/dp/B0173P3O16/ref=asc_df_B0173P3O16/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=216531775325&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=4657220126082372686&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-370918601718&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small nut gatherer&lt;/a&gt;, and their electric yellow makes them incredibly easy to spot on the ground. No word on whether they’re biodegradable should someone decide to be lazy, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhpWdm"&gt;“We produced probably a dozen different colors and just threw them out into a lawn out back to see which is easiest to see — that neon yellow popped,” Nerf brand manager Greg Nyland told me. It’s true: despite being smaller than Rival, they catch my eye at a distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xQLHlQjJ3eiQQRZhNJptaQI6oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835532/verge_sean_hollister_20210516.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tall grass doesn’t necessarily present an issue...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiwshh9tYZryrU-yTdJ8_Ey3e4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835535/verge_sean_hollister_20210904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...but clumpy turf can. There are three balls hidden in this picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5MuRkR"&gt;You can even use a black light to find them at night, since they’re UV-reactive. They do bounce everywhere and roll all over the place, and could get lost in storm grates, but the only time I personally had trouble was in dense, clumpy grass where they’d fall into little pockets of turf and I had to be standing at the right angle to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0la05v"&gt;Perhaps as importantly, the blasters can spit out these rounds more powerfully than anything else Hasbro will let you buy on a shelf. I consistently saw all three blasters exceeding 100 feet per second on my chronograph, with the Rush-40 and Siege-50 regularly crossing the 115 feet per second mark. And while those balls did dive into the ground when I fired flat, I measured ranges of up to 150 feet with my distance measuring wheel after I angled shots up into the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wjOiyXE8c5kJhMS9iqVMgqCYUgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835543/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rush-40 and the Kronos are practically the same blaster but with a different ammo type.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="grhWHI"&gt;To get a sense of how much performance has changed, I compared the Hyper Rush-40 to the Rival Kronos — since the Rush is largely just a Kronos with the new projectiles on board. As you can see in the chart, the Rush’s maximum range absolutely dwarfs the Kronos, but at the expense of range when shot flat. With the old Kronos, I can sometimes hit things I see in my sights, but I found little reason to aim with Hyper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULwUE2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741937"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TV7YQy"&gt;Range isn’t the whole story, though. The Hyper rounds hit harder (I asked friends to shoot me in the face), so it’s more obvious when you’ve been tagged. They travel faster and don’t loft in the air quite like Rival rounds, so they’ll likely be harder to dodge, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctMFVT"&gt;Speaking of lofting and range, Hasbro surprisingly omitted a feature from two of these blasters typically used to improve both: a little rubber nub called a “hop-up” that adds backspin to the ball, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect"&gt;taking advantage of the Magnus effect&lt;/a&gt; to fly through the air. But the Rush-40 and Mach-100 mysteriously don’t have a hop-up, even though the Rival blasters they’re based on (the aforementioned Rival Kronos and Rival Perses) most definitely do. And while the Siege-50 has one, mine barely worked. Still, some Nerfers have &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Og-ht0nN354?t=742"&gt;already created&lt;/a&gt; 3D printed aftermarket hop-ups for the Rush-40 that seem to improve their accuracy. It’s likely Hasbro’s future Hyper blasters will, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLOejC"&gt;I’m less certain why Hyper rounds feed so poorly, but I have a theory. To make them safe, Hasbro made them squishy, and now they’re &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; gummy to avoid sticking on each other when they’re crammed into a hopper. I imagine they could even jam blasters if not for the Hyper hoppers’ tilt-down-to-load feeding chutes, which ensure only one round gets chambered at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIZYCvBTa8e57KcL8o1NVSOu4Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835619/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyper vs. Rival vs. Elite vs. Mega ammo size comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYcbNroOpMLwSJw9dU67j57o8Gw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835620/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squishing both Rival and Hyper balls. My thumb sinks into Rival a little like a pillow, while the gummy Hyper bulges out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wzMJFh"&gt;It’s tricky. If Hasbro had simply made its foam Rival balls smaller, they would have been lighter too, which isn’t necessarily helpful for speed and accuracy. But if you make them denser to fix those things, they aren’t quite as soft — and as Hasbro veteran engineer Bob DeRoche explained on the call, every single blaster the company makes has to meet its Kinetic Energy Disbursement (KED) standard for safety. “Based on the speed, the weight, the diameter, and how much that disperses, you have to be under that KED number. If it’s under that, you’re safe — it’ll hurt your eye, it won’t feel good, but it won’t damage your eye, he says.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6rC3m"&gt;Technically, every single Hyper blaster comes with a pair of safety glasses too — a first for a Nerf product, I believe — and prominent warning labels about wearing them in the field. But the primary safety mechanism was building a TPE pellet with the right squish, and the team admits that squish was a challenge for the blasters — which, remember, they had to develop simultaneously. “We didn’t have that luxury of time,” says DeRoche. “When we first got those samples of the round and got closer to what we wanted, we were still getting into the final state of not being as tacky or sticky,” adding that it was “problematic” to keep them fluffed and loose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xku9bQ"&gt;That’s why Hasbro decided to start with hopper-fed blasters to begin with, as opposed to compression feeding systems like a spring-loaded magazine. Nyland suggests we shouldn’t rule out other feeding mechanisms, though, pointing to just how much Nerf’s Rival line evolved since its 2015 debut, too. I have to admit he’s got a point: &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/nerf-rival-review-the-evolution-of-foam-warfare-1730896686"&gt;the first Rival blasters showed off serious potential&lt;/a&gt;, but their tiny magazines and terrible ergonomics were vastly improved just a couple years later. I’d be excited to see co-branded &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; blasters that can actually fit a decent number of shots inside, but I wonder whether the gummy rounds will ever work in a truly enclosed space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A6lurj"&gt;The competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SqAmc0"&gt;But the real reason to skip Hyper — for now — isn’t any of these issues. It’s that Hyper doesn’t compete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB4ZDH"&gt;Not only does Hyper require you to buy into a new, unproven ammo type that likely won’t be available at your local Nerf war, Hasbro’s expecting teens and young adults to see them as the blaster of choice for sporting-grade Nerf, and that’s just not the reality today. The sporting part of the Nerf community is increasingly standardizing on half-length of the same size of dart that Hasbro’s blasters have used for years, to the point nearly every player at my last Nerf war had at least one short dart blaster in their loadout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y11ga"&gt;Modern short darts from brands like Worker and Dart Zone fly so straight you can consistently hit things you aim at. They’re cheap, too: typically between 8 and 10 cents per dart, compared to the 15 to 21 cents you’ll pay per Hyper ball right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AyalQZsCAr52niuU_fM-t22wYk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835617/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At $40, I’d buy a Dart Zone Conquest Pro over a Nerf Hyper Siege-50 any day of the week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="np2GvQ"&gt;And you don’t need to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"&gt;the kind of incredible 3D printed blasters we featured here&lt;/a&gt; to get started, because an upstart rival named Dart Zone is making it increasingly easy to get into short darts, too. For the same $40 you’d pay for Hasbro’s Hyper Siege-50, you could hit up a Walmart for the similar pump-action-shotgun-esque &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-Conquest-Pro-Half-Length-Ultimate-Dart-Blaster%2F185917597&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dart Zone Conquest Pro&lt;/a&gt; instead, and have 15 darts that actually fly where you aim them with just as much power and without the feeding issues. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-Pro-Blaster-Ammo-Clip-Refill-Compatible-with-Nexus-Pro-Aeon-Pro-and-Conquest-Pro%2F476510661&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 more buys a pair of additional magazines&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-100-Half-Length-Pro-Dart-Refill-Shoots-Over-125-FT%2F809673491%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26wl13%3D2031%26adid%3D22222222420449455996%26wmlspartner%3Dwmtlabs%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D501107745824%26wl4%3Dpla-293946777986%26wl5%3D9032047%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Dlocal%26wl12%3D809673491%26wl13%3D2031%26veh%3Dsem_LIA%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwvuGJBhB1EiwACU1AiX0wrzxpgItQh7nSJEEwEbA9uySZFYYznU2JDWfTJ1CndnRZbrX91BoC8wUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 additional darts&lt;/a&gt;, compared to $12 (on sale!) for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NER-H-Refill-Canister-50/dp/B0851GQJ1G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a canister of just 50 Hyper rounds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vK2A4Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The engineers building ridiculous dart blasters that Nerf won’t touch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gw9tVp"&gt;I was able to keep some foes pinned down with the Mach-100, and I got some tags with the others too, but I spent most of my time wishing I had something more reliable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Do4kK6"&gt;Perhaps the biggest thing I don’t understand about Hasbro’s foam-flinging strategy is why it let this competition go unchecked, instead of building better darts itself. It was Nerf that popularized the foam dart &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Nerf/History"&gt;some 29 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but the competition’s short darts and even full-lengths fly so much better than any projectile Hasbro has ever made. Perhaps that’s intentional for safety reasons, or for fun? (I do remember when dodging darts all &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-style was a great part of the game.) But Walmart seems perfectly happy to carry Dart Zone’s more powerful and accurate blasters, and without requiring bundled safety glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WzaAH6"&gt;Maybe Hyper will surprise us, but after this slow start and the company’s forgettable Ultra and Elite 2.0 lines (both of which performed worse than previous blasters in a number of ways), I’m hoping Hasbro might take a harder look at how it can truly compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzsVNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9jfUV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads for $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, more than 30 percent off the typical list price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $90 ($45 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids+ service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. We’ve seen the Kindle Kids Edition drop to as low as $70 during Amazon Prime Day, which is its current price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;As far as deals go, you can currently pick up the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support for $85 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition at Amazon for $105&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHnfba6HB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the 32GB Paperwhite with ads for $110; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $130 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon is running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $125&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $115&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $140&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="JA82PQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google settles with worker allegedly fired for his workplace activism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z09WWoC_zhwdLcsWCe8VaMjVrZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831999/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N0gM6"&gt;Google reached a settlement with a fired employee who the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims was let go from the company for his workplace activism, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/google-settles-with-employee-allegedly-fired-for-activism?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The employee, Laurence Berland, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20983053/google-fires-four-employees-memo-rebecca-rivers-laurence-berland-union-busting-accusation-walkout"&gt;fired in 2019&lt;/a&gt; allegedly for violating Google’s data security policies. He had been a vocal critic of Google’s work with the US Customs and Border Protection and was terminated amid internal organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS1ix5"&gt;The settlement was approved in July by the NLRB, though the terms haven’t been revealed, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JGpO7"&gt;The NLRB has accused Google of violating labor law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;in firing Berland and four other workers in 2019&lt;/a&gt; over organizing activities and is still battling Google over those accusations. One employee, Kathryn Spiers, was allegedly fired for creating an internal pop-up message reminding workers of their labor rights; Google said she didn’t have the proper approval for sending that code, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;according to Spiers&lt;/a&gt;. The other employees, including Berland, Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers, and Paul Duke, say they were fired for &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/google-fired-us-for-organizing-were-fighting-back-d0daa8113aed"&gt;participating in protected labor organizing&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/3/20992786/google-workers-fired-nlrb-laurence-berland-rebecca-rivers-sophie-waldman-paul-duke"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; they were let go for violating the company’s data security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
