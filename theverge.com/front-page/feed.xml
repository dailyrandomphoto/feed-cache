    <title>EU approves Microsoft’s $7.5 billion Bethesda acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxA1FKWo9liaTlYi4cGanFj2azQ=/1x0:1848x1231/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68928256/xboxbethesda.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MRXMdN"&gt;The European Commission has approved Microsoft’s $7.5 billion deal to acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; studio Bethesda Softworks. Microsoft’s deal has been &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=2_M_10001"&gt;approved by the EU&lt;/a&gt; without conditions, as it “does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market.” The acquisition required EU approval before Microsoft could finalize the Bethesda deal and bring future games to its Xbox Game Pass subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgdwHE"&gt;Once the deal is closed, Microsoft’s list of first-party studios will jump to 23, following the addition of Bethesda sub-studios like &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; developer Arkane, &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein&lt;/em&gt; studio MachineGames, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; maker id Software, and &lt;em&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/em&gt; studio Tango Gameworks. Microsoft appears to be planning to keep Bethesda running separately, with its existing leadership. That approach seems to have worked for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151477/microsoft-minecraft-mojang-acquisition"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11920072/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-2016"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which have all continued to run separately after Microsoft acquired them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5YFNLo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Microsoft bought Bethesda for $7.5 billion ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ha3Rnn"&gt;Microsoft originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x"&gt;announced its plans&lt;/a&gt; to acquire Bethesda in September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;promising to honor PS5 exclusivity commitments&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;GhostWire: Tokyo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls: Online &lt;/em&gt;will also “continue to be supported exactly as it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbzm1w"&gt;How Microsoft handles future Bethesda titles will come down to a “case-by-case” basis, according to comments from Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer in September. It’s still not clear how Microsoft plans to handle the upcoming space epic &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eiaA8"&gt;Microsoft might not even have to launch future Bethesda games exclusively on Xbox. Just having them on day one on Xbox Game Pass might be a big enough draw in itself for players to subscribe. Xbox gaming chief Phil Spencer has also &lt;a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/phil-spencer-on-exclusivity-monetisation-and-game-development/"&gt;questioned the viability&lt;/a&gt; of exclusivity deals for games recently, and Microsoft’s plans for Xbox are very much centered on Xbox Game Pass and xCloud game streaming reaching millions more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srO87z"&gt;In fact, Microsoft is reportedly planning to outline its plans for Xbox later this month. A “future of gaming” event is rumored to take place on March 23rd, and it could be an ideal opportunity for Microsoft to discuss the future of Bethesda, xCloud on iOS, and its plans for Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ next phones will come out on March 23rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gd20eAxmGutUK_pqXNBPCzRYU9o=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68928031/Image_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;OnePlus confirms it will launch its 9-series devices later this month. | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJkiMb"&gt;OnePlus has announced an official launch date for its next phones: the OnePlus 9 series will be formally announced on March 23rd at 10AM ET. It’s also confirming a partnership with Swedish camera maker Hasselblad to improve the devices’ camera systems — something that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272052/oneplus-9-pro-hasselbland-quad-rear-cameras-ultrawide-telephoto-zoom-specs"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306934/oneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau"&gt;hinted at&lt;/a&gt; previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l81V8D"&gt;Rumors thus far have pointed to the announcement of a OnePlus 9 Pro with curved 1440p 120Hz display, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;45W fast charging&lt;/a&gt;, and reverse wireless charging. OnePlus’ reference to the “series” product launch would seem to confirm more than one device debuting later this month. There’s also confirmation of 5G, which isn’t surprising in this year of our lord 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="07e4P0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies have tweaked the cameras’ color reproduction to look more natural&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0mobt"&gt;As for the Hasselblad partnership, details aren’t super promising. The two companies have agreed to a three-year deal to “co-develop the next generation of smartphone camera systems for future OnePlus flagship devices.” That includes the upcoming 9-series devices. For a start, the companies claim to have tweaked the cameras’ color reproduction to look more natural. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSWx1S"&gt;The 9-series will also use a new Sony IMX789 sensor and offer 12-bit RAW image capture, which the Samsung S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max also include. That’s a nice step forward to capture and retain this large amount of data, and it’s helpful for post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct36Tw"&gt;But a standard RAW file — even one that’s 12-bit — still misses out on the benefits of computational photography that you’ll enjoy taking a regular JPEG image with the native camera app. It would be even better to offer something like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;Apple’s ProRAW&lt;/a&gt;, which combines the benefits of those computational techniques and RAW image capture. That doesn’t seem to be what OnePlus is describing here, but we’ve reached out to ask and will update this story accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oPalkR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 8 Pro review: big league","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8 review: familiar formula","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219278/oneplus-8-review-specs-features-camera-battery-screen-price-photos-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SYLFho"&gt;It’s fair to treat this Hasselblad partnership with some skepticism. OnePlus is far from the first smartphone manufacturer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11111022/huawei-leica-collaboration-mobile-photography"&gt;partner with a legacy camera brand&lt;/a&gt;, and results from previous partnerships &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/26/11507260/leica-phone-huawei-p9-no"&gt;haven’t amounted to much&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t even Hasselblad’s first partnership with a phone manufacturer. The company previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/31/12729838/hasselblad-true-zoom-announced-moto-z"&gt;loaned its name to a MotoMod&lt;/a&gt; that was more or less just an underwhelming point-and-shoot camera. In this case, at least, the results of this joint venture will go into the phone itself — not on something that attaches to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo overtakes Huawei to lead Chinese smartphone market for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KE_veaLpsdmmpG5MQIUdKpc8ApY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68927938/DSCF7293.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M3PqSc"&gt;Oppo has become the best-selling smartphone brand in China for the first time ever, &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/oppo-becomes-number-1-smartphone-brand-china-first-time-ever/"&gt;according to figures from Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;. Counterpoint’s report says that Oppo managed to capture 21 percent of the world’s biggest smartphone market in January, ahead of Vivo and Huawei, which both achieved 20 percent. Apple and Xiaomi rounded out the top five with 16 percent apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwWkpF"&gt;Oppo’s sales were up 26 percent year on year and increased 33 percent from the previous month. Counterpoint says that the new Reno 5 series had a successful launch due to offering better specs at a lower price point than the earlier Reno 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EktVGt"&gt;But for Oppo to gain market share, someone has to lose it, and the report shows that Huawei’s smartphone troubles are taking hold in China too. Counterpoint says Huawei has increased its focus on the premium market because of component shortages caused by US sanctions, so Chinese distributors have been focusing on other brands for volume. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei’s sale of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, which was also sparked by sanctions, will cut its market share down further, with Honor now considered a competitor as opposed to an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v720FG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindX3Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOFindX3Pro&lt;/a&gt;, our latest high-end flagship series. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AwakenColour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AwakenColour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GxerLioEq3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GxerLioEq3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1368748571101597698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U8NFzq"&gt;These figures are just for one month, but Counterpoint expects Huawei’s share of the market to continue its decline throughout 2021. Oppo will look to capitalize on the opportunity with the launch of its latest flagship phone, the Find X3 Pro, which is being announced in full on Thursday. If you want an early look, the company just tweeted a teaser that doesn’t leave a whole lot to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Without Remorse, Thunder Force, and a new teaser for The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hollywood Exteriors And Landmarks - 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szZ0j9zfTX3xbq6F6gCHQjxSYoo=/1098x421:4032x2377/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68926785/1231480531.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZ0zu6"&gt;I had the end of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; spoiled before I watched it because I basically work on the internet and couldn’t quite avoid it, so I won’t do the same to you, dear reader. Let’s just say I didn’t hate it? My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;Julia Alexander writes in her review&lt;/a&gt; that the finale “never lost sight of the story it wanted to tell, the show it wanted to be, and the finale does a mostly decent job of hitting those final notes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1y8rI"&gt;Next up in the MCU, of course, is&lt;em&gt; The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;. After giving us a full trailer during the Super Bowl last month, Marvel dropped a new teaser titled “Coworkers” (it’s over before you know it) so let’s dive in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="stzMaw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdBUjYJ4-GQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IbRaq7"&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWm0XR"&gt;This was supposed to be Marvel Studios’ first big original series for Disney Plus, but it got bumped several times (and yes, one reason was the coronavirus pandemic). The six-episode series takes place after &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, with Sam Wilson/Falcon picking up where Captain America left off, and teaming up with Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, starring Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, hits Disney Plus on March 19th. Can’t wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eDVbkp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnx6-YLXFwg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HRLCET"&gt;Thunder Force&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EFxfsQ"&gt;Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer as a couple of childhood best friends turned 40-something, crime-fighting superheroes? Yes, please. Bobby Cannavale is a villain (who utters the line “how can we not stop two chicks in their forties?!” which, lol) with glowing red eyes (a little unsubtle but OK) and Jason Bateman’s character has crab claws for hands so let’s assume he’s also a baddie (but apparently a Capricorn, not a Cancer). Directed by McCarthy’s husband and longtime collaborator Ben Falcone, &lt;em&gt;Thunder Force&lt;/em&gt; hits Netflix April 9th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q01TXT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11wwx5VKThY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2DSsg1"&gt;Voyagers &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W0dRWL"&gt;I watched this trailer a couple of times because I wasn’t totally sure what was going on other than some sexy antics and people taking a drug referred to as “blue.” And also Colin Farrell. Also they’re in space. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/video/voyagers-trailer-colin-farrell-tye-sheridan-lily-rose-depp-blast-off-in-psychedelic-space-trip/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; describes &lt;em&gt;Voyagers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a “sci-fi YA bacchanalia,” so it seems I was on the right track. &lt;em&gt;Voyagers&lt;/em&gt; was written and directed by Neil Burger, who also directed the YA staple &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to Farrell, &lt;em&gt;Voyagers&lt;/em&gt; stars Lily-Rose Depp, Tye Sheridan, and Fionn Whitehead, and is due in theaters April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6V7pJp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-rw2cxFVLg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FxIptT"&gt;Without Remorse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Gnv5cc"&gt;Michael B. Jordan stars as Navy SEAL John Kelly, who is seeking revenge on Russian soldiers who attack him and kill his pregnant wife. Without Remorse is based on the 1993 Tom Clancy novel, and is a spinoff from Clancy’s &lt;em&gt;Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt; series (note that Harrison Ford, John Krasinski, Alec Baldwin, Ben Affleck, and Chris Pine have all played Ryan in various films, so yeah, it’s time to get a new Clancy character in the mix). Brett Gelman, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Jamie Bell star in &lt;em&gt;Without Remorse&lt;/em&gt;, which is directed by Stefano Sollima and comes to Amazon Prime Video on April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google HR reportedly advised mental health leave in response to complaints of racist or sexist behavior</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2b51wk3MJ5v0UcM0lETOLfX6i8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68926316/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFuzJs"&gt;Several current and former Google employees say the company’s human resources department would often suggest mental health counseling or leave in response to complaints about racist or sexist behavior in the workplace, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-advised-mental-health-care-when-workers-complained-about-racism-n1259728"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBj8L6"&gt;The workers described encounters with coworkers that included racist comments about skin color and hairstyles, as well as sexual harassment. When they contacted Google’s human resources department, each was encouraged to take mental health leave, even when their complaints were unrelated to mental health concerns, according to &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ee9qYa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Timnit Gebru was fired from Google — then the harassers arrived","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gdZRKY"&gt;The report follows the December firing of Google AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru, who refused a manager’s request to retract a paper that described the dangers of language models like the ones Google relies on to power its search engine. Gebru wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv&lt;/a&gt; describing her frustration over the paper, and mentioned her doubts about Google’s commitments to diversity and inclusion. She says Google told her the email was “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Google’s head of AI claimed Gebru resigned, which she has vehemently disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEk5bs"&gt;And April Christina Curley, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/second-top-black-female-google-employee-says-she-was-ousted-n1252277"&gt;Black woman who worked as a diversity recruiter&lt;/a&gt; for Google, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135824730013696"&gt;said she was fired in September&lt;/a&gt; after being denied promotions and having her pay cut, despite her strong work performance and her successful recruitment of hundreds of students from historically Black colleges and universities to Google’s engineering department. Curley told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt; she was also encouraged to take mental health leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k94uS1"&gt;Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday, but a spokeswoman told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; that “all concerns reported to us are investigated rigorously, and we take firm action against employees who violate our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple mixed-reality headset likely coming sometime in 2022, analyst predicts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GM6j7JAfkcWWDb-2Kqv5qjSxH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925839/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rC9zwg"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts in a new research note that Apple will release a “helmet-type” mixed reality headset next year, augmented reality glasses in mid-2025, and an AR contact lens product by 2030-2040, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLmg9"&gt;“We foresee that the helmet product will provide AR and VR experiences, while glasses and contact lens types of products are more likely to focus on AR applications,” Kuo writes in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAGYsV"&gt;While several prototypes of Apple’s mixed reality headset weigh between 200 and 300 grams, Kuo says, if Apple can solve some technical problems the headset could end up weighing between 100 and 200 grams, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reported. He added that the headset will likely be priced in the $1,000 range in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERZ1mP"&gt;The headset will be able to offer an immersive experience Kuo says will be “significantly better” than those on the market now, with Sony micro-OLED displays, and should be able to run independently of an iPhone, “more like a portable product” than a mobile one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b5abT"&gt;Kuo’s note is mostly in line with other predictions of a headset &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;hitting the market sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but with the price tag closer to $3,000. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that Apple was using a fabric mesh material to reduce the weight of the headset, and had a rendering based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype” that showed what the headset might look like. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla is expanding its Full Self Driving beta to more drivers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjcbGl3YN-MVwupcqS-ueHAg8YA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925714/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sHoO9G"&gt;Tesla is expanding its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta, CEO Elon Musk said, doubling its size with a new software update, and eventually increasing the number of participants tenfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S441d"&gt;“Still be careful, but it’s getting mature,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368017749851598850?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Friday. He said Saturday that Tesla would add a “download beta” button to Tesla displays in the coming days “due to high levels of demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iiLwMh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding “Download Beta” button to Service section of car display in ~10 days &lt;a href="https://t.co/D6M3ZiMarG"&gt;https://t.co/D6M3ZiMarG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368329387733512193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hOxxvV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527577/tesla-full-self-driving-autopilot-beta-software-update"&gt;Tesla first introduced the FSD beta in October&lt;/a&gt; to vehicle owners in its Early Access Program. At the time, Musk said the company was handling the software update “very cautiously.” Drivers still are expected to keep their hands on the steering wheel and should be prepared to assume control of their Tesla at any time. Tesla uses the data from the FSB beta to improve performance, and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/05/elon-musk-tesla-doubling-size-full-self-driving-beta-program/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Musk said last month there were about 1,000 vehicles in the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FofUkD"&gt;Musk noted that in Tesla’s case, the term “beta is used to reduce complacency in usage and set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested by Tesla simulation and QA drive teams.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUACv"&gt;He added that availability of the FSD beta will vary by region, due to what he called regulatory approval delays and Tesla’s own internal development and testing. Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1368249032783491079?s=21"&gt;director of AI tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla owners interested in participating in the beta should email earlyaccess@tesla.com,  which he says the company is using to coordinate the program&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom King’s Vision comics are the perfect follow-up to WandaVision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPw5KBlv6BG4uqk8z5WNrLaO3GY=/0x2:975x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925488/vision.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6wu9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This weekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bivWz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s season finale has hit Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’ve got a hankering for more surreal suburban comic book drama, look no further than &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt;, a 12-issue run from writer Tom King and artist Gabriel Hernandez Walta, which explores further the idea of a superhero trying to step back and start a family — no matter the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQefD6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; is a 12-issue comic series. While it lightly ties into the character’s past history over decades of comics, it’s largely a standalone story: Vision moves to the DC suburbs, and (literally) makes a family: a wife, Virginia, and two teenage kids, Viv and Vin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmuT7m"&gt;Issue one drops readers right into the mix alongside the newly minted synthezoid family. Vision is trying to juggle his work as an Avenger (and as the superhero group’s government liaison) and as a new father and husband; Virginia works to fit into the neighborhood; and the twins struggle with teenage drama of trying to fit in at school (which is particularly hard given their robotic nature and superpowers). Later issues also include Sparky, a particularly adorable synthezoid dog. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlpKp3XkG8WoorLhshA7V_WduLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348250/vdc1250_107_comp_v004_r709_a3f29eea.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GHAMCj"&gt;It’s the kind of series that sees Vision battling a gigantic monster alongside the Avengers while also chatting on the phone with Virginia to sort out drama with the twins at school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXoa9R"&gt;But throughout it all is a creeping sense of horror and dread, helped by an unseen narrator that promises throughout the issue that Vision’s seemingly perfect suburban life will end in tears. Things start out relatively benign, like neighbors who are unnerved by the family or a mean spray-painted slogan on the garage, but things quickly devolve into murder cover-ups as Vision and his new family start to get stuck in a web of lies, misunderstandings, and revenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2DVYM"&gt;If you enjoyed the slow burn of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeTomKingComics030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/a&gt;, with super-heroic drama sandwiched between an unnerving illusion of home tranquility, &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; #1 (and the rest of the run) should offer plenty more fodder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dthY6X"&gt;The series is great for newcomers to Vision as a character, too: interspersed across the run is a reexamination of pivotal moments in the artificial hero’s career, including his relationship with Wanda, their desire for a family, his time as a familiar-looking White Vision that has lost all his memories, and more. For MCU fans that are more familiar with Vision’s on-screen origin, it’s a good look at the original version of the character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVe3Mp"&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; is a compelling look at the foibles and follies of people, and an examination of what someone would be willing to do to protect their family. What could be more human than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yhH1r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s it by?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vision &lt;/em&gt;was created by writer Tom King (also known for his recent run on &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; and his acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Mister Miracle&lt;/em&gt; series), artist Gabriel Hernandez Walta, and colorist Jordie Bellaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tg7Okv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"So you want to start reading comics? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22303444/comics-buying-guide-subscription-comixology-marvel-unlimited-dc-universe-infinite"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wrP0fY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it?&lt;/strong&gt; The entire twelve-issue run is available on the &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/unlimited"&gt;Marvel Unlimited subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vision-Complete-Directors-Cut-ebook/dp/B077ZG3HY4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;digital collection&lt;/a&gt; is also available from Kindle / Comixology for $6.49, along with paperback and hardcover collections (which are a little pricier and harder to find). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian intelligence reportedly used fake news sites to spread misinformation about coronavirus vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fP-Yqerd7gOtIuMxHPHNm49OyAI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925480/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E5cuEJ"&gt;Four online publications linked to Russian intelligence agencies have been spreading false or misleading information about coronavirus vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, citing an official at the US Department of State’s Global Engagement Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZNXSs"&gt;The sites, identified as New Eastern Outlook, Oriental Review, News Front, and Rebel Inside, have emphasized the side effects of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine as well as other western pharma companies’ vaccines, stoking concerns about whether the vaccines are effective or had been rushed through the US approval process, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lbQqG"&gt;The sites don’t have large audiences, but officials said their false stories are often picked up and circulated by international media. They typically focus on true news reports about rare side effects of the vaccines, but fail to provide accurate context that shows the vaccines are safe for most people. “Russian intelligence services bear direct responsibility for using these four platforms to spread propaganda and lies,” a State Department spokesman told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSIICA"&gt;In addition to the campaign to discredit Western vaccines, Russia’s state media and Twitter accounts connected to the Russian government are also trying to boost the profile of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWOF25"&gt;A spokesperson for the Kremlin denied the allegations to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCw3wX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/russia-s-claim-successful-covid-19-vaccine-doesn-t-pass-smell-test-critics-say"&gt;Russia announced in November&lt;/a&gt; that its Sputnik V vaccine had efficacy of 90 percent, but critics said the clinical trials of the vaccine on patients were too small. However, British medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00191-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that larger-scale testing had found Sputnik V was safe, and had a 91 percent efficacy rate. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-global-trade-middle-east-diplomacy-moscow-e61ebd3c8fe746c60f5ecc1ec323c99a"&gt;According to the&lt;em&gt; Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; as of late February only 4 million people in Russia— about 3 percent of the population— had been vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The most powerful Wear OS watches are held back by Wear OS</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Android users still can’t get anything as good as the Apple Watch&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8JIy2S"&gt;For the past month, I’ve been testing the two most powerful Wear OS watches you can buy: the TicWatch Pro 3 from Mobvoi and the Fossil Gen 5 LTE. They’re not spec-for-spec identical, but they do share a basic shape: big, chunky, round, and black. If you’re using Android and want a smartwatch, they’re at the top of a persistently tiny list of top-flight smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7Zd3b"&gt;Despite Wear OS’s reputation, both watches are perfectly competent and can do the basics of what many people want out of a smartwatch. Both also offer what I’d characterize as acceptable battery life: a full day most of the time, two at a stretch. The TicWatch can actually go much longer, thanks to a clever second screen layered on top of the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCNKNu"&gt;But Wear OS does have that reputation: for years, watches that ran it have been slow, ran out of battery life quickly, and suffered from a tiny ecosystem of apps. Some of those problems have been solved, but that doesn’t mean that these watches (or, honestly, any smartwatch available to Android owners) lives up to the polish and features iPhone users can get with the Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1vJz9"&gt;The Apple Watch comparison isn’t really useful for Android users — it’s not and probably never will be an option. Instead, let’s just look at these two watches on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Mobvoi TicWatch 3 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kts0fR4e5rhqCadWxU7nIfmFjCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21998689/dbohn_201028_4270_0002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mobvoi TicWatch 3 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jjI83C"&gt;TicWatch Pro 3 review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="j02eF6"&gt;At $299.99, the TicWatch Pro 3 is not an impulse buy. But the price is about right for what Mobvoi has created. It has pushed the limits of what Wear OS can do in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni0LzI"&gt;First, it has crammed the best technology it could get for a Wear OS device in here. One big differentiator for the TicWatch Pro 3 is that it is the only watch using Qualcomm’s latest smartwatch processor, the Snapdragon 4100. (More from Motorola and possibly OnePlus have been rumored to be coming this year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gihATw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374880"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1rlNQ9"&gt;That processor makes the watch faster than other Wear OS devices — though it still can sometimes feel a step behind both Samsung’s Tizen-based watches and even Fitbits. It also accounts for some of the TicWatch’s battery life, which I’ve found can last two and even three days with all the bells and whistles turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfPhz6"&gt;The second thing Mobvoi has done to push Wear OS is add a bunch of bells and whistles to make up for the platform’s missing features. The main thing it’s done is put an LCD panel on top of the regular OLED screen. This allows the TicWatch to go into a low power mode when it’s on standby and a super-low power mode when you need it to last for more than a few days on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl87Ni"&gt;Wear OS powers its fitness offerings with Google Fit, which has seen a few updates but is very far behind Apple’s fitness offerings. Mobvoi can’t fix that, but it has tried to fill in the gaps with its own suite of fitness apps on the watch. It even includes a blood oxygen sensor — though it’s no more accurate than the norm for smartwatches, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;which isn’t very good&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe5bop"&gt;However, using them requires you to place a large amount of trust in Mobvoi the company — as the watch makes perfectly clear when you try to launch these apps, there’s no way to do that without sharing a bunch of information with Mobvoi. I applaud the transparency, but that still wasn’t enough to make me comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W34wt2"&gt;One thing to keep in mind with the TicWatch Pro 3: its aesthetics. It’s unapologetically a big, chunky watch. I don’t have huge wrists and it absolutely feels dominated by this thing. It is “honest” in its design, at least, in that it isn’t trying to look like a fancier watch than it is — right on down to the matte plastic lugs that hold the replaceable straps in place. I also wish it had a rotating crown for scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woqBmV"&gt;I ended up using the TicWatch Pro 3 like a bog standard Wear OS watch in the end, turning off its extra screen and sticking to Google Fit for fitness data. It absolutely did the job, but at $299 I think most people would be better off considering other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUPAkp"&gt;There is only one spec that the TicWatch lacks: LTE. For that, you’ll need to buy the Fossil.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6aYjUT"&gt;Fossil Gen 5 LTE review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r3UOSx"&gt;I reviewed the original &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and I called it the “best of a Wear OS situation.” I think that (dubious) honor now goes to the TicWatch Pro 3, but if you need LTE, the $349 Fossil Gen 5 is one of two options you’ve got on Android (the other is Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 3 LTE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9grr4o"&gt;Fortunately, the Fossil Gen 5 is essentially unchanged by the addition of LTE. If you’re willing to pay your carrier the extra monthly charges to turn it on, using the Gen 5 with LTE felt virtually the same as using it with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvz6s1"&gt;Even battery life didn’t seem to be a problem. I did notice the watch was more likely to hit two full days with LTE turned off, but I usually didn’t manage to drain it in a single day even when using mostly LTE. Sadly, Fossil also feels as though it needs to make up for Wear OS’s shortcomings by keeping its entirely too complicated battery saver features. A watch should never require users to dig into granular radio toggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji1cnG"&gt;It does still use the older Snapdragon 3100 processor, though it didn’t feel particularly slow as a result. Aesthetically, it’s very slightly different from the regular Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle that I own and it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much smaller than the TicWatch, but subtle differences make it look just a little more premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erRx07"&gt;All in all, if you must have an LTE smartwatch and you use Android, this is your best option if you really prefer Wear OS to Tizen. If you’re agnostic, I think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Watch 3 with LTE is probably a better choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="JuXsr6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374915"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2LQ1WT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10374870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Wear OS watches" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkEjmOfbSAu7BNtY6H9bDrOcmas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346216/DSC02550_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wear OS watches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7B4rWR"&gt;As I’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17277608/android-wear-os-gear-sport-fitbit-versa-skagen-smartwatch"&gt;harping on for three years now, every smartwatch for Android involves some kind of compromise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ueQnD"&gt;Samsung watches need a lot more apps and require you to install a lot of extra stuff on your phone to get them working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzk8F7"&gt;Fitbits are great for fitness but not so great at integrating into Android. There’s also the not-so-little matter about the company now being owned by Google’s hardware division. The future of the entire Fitbit ecosystem is sort of up in the air right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PlRVEt"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Android deserves better smartwatches. Here’s why|37724" data-volume-uuid="af3b4b5b6" data-volume-id="37724" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-893" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mkqVcE"&gt;And honestly, the future of Wear OS is also up in the air. There’s little movement lately in app support and though Google has done a decent enough job keeping the OS from falling into utter decay, it hasn’t done much more than that. It’s overdue for an overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7iYHj"&gt;There are likely more Wear OS watches coming that might be worth waiting for, but the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 remains the best option for traditional smartwatch stuff. At the end of the day, it’s difficult to recommend anybody spend three or four hundred dollars to get on board the rudderless Wear OS boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vhGwiu"&gt;Both the TicWatch Pro 3 and the Fossil Gen 5 LTE are good enough smartwatches for what they are. It’s just that what they are is the best of an old platform with a questionable future.&lt;/p&gt;
