    <title>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 leak suggests better battery life is on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDs1lohe7zoLNw1jfRaZwNTjh5U=/338x0:2162x1216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573764/17a1cca82fdaa085e6a7da0895a7b6855c33cd7b5943c466b0f539c1b260d8b4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlwoQb"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2 seems like it will improve on the battery life and price of its predecessor, according to leaked Samsung slides (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/23/galaxy-chromebook-2-specs-leak/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;previous Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; was an attractively designed 2-in-1 that nonetheless faltered due to its battery life and high $999 price tag. If these slides are to be believed, then next year might hold some Chromebooks to be hopeful about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC4EoH"&gt;The most important change is that battery life. The slides shared by leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_?s=20"&gt;WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt; say Samsung is targeting 12-plus hours of battery life on this new model. That’s a lot more than the measly 4 hours and 20 minutes (and the 8 hours Samsung promised) we observed in our review of this year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1oLI5V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;p.s. how about 699? &lt;a href="https://t.co/DDSdmTiDu3"&gt;https://t.co/DDSdmTiDu3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341780886954512387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yINy07"&gt;Samsung’s slides also note the Galaxy Chromebook 2 will be the first Chromebook with a QLED, or quantum dot LED, screen. The company’s previous Chromebook used a 4K AMOLED, a choice which seemed to hurt the battery life of the device. Switching to QLED would match the change Samsung made in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/29/20938145/samsung-galaxy-book-flex-ion-laptops-design-wireless-charging-qled-hands-on"&gt;its non-Chrome OS laptops in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqWkFS"&gt;The old Galaxy Chromebook relied on an Intel 10th-gen Core i5 that was more than capable of handling the tasks Samsung imagined customers would use the device for, but this new Galaxy Chromebook 2 is supposedly switching to a 10th-gen Core i3. It isn’t necessarily a step down for browser-based work in Chrome OS, but it is interesting considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505926/intel-11th-gen-rocket-lake-desktop-processors-q1-2021-amd"&gt;the availability of 11th-gen Intel processors in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wctmX"&gt;All these changes may have played a role in the $699 (likely entry-level) price, the final notable tidbit from WalkingCat’s leak. The original Galaxy Chromebook was pitched as something “premium” for “professionals,” and at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194081/samsung-leaked-galaxy-chromebook-2-orange-color-ces-2021"&gt;from the renders we’ve seen&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is maintaining that sleek design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II3XNX"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook 2’s cheaper price puts it closer to actual high-end Chromebooks than to proper laptops from Apple and others. Swapping to a different processor, and relying on a display it already sources for its other laptops, could help improve sales, especially when combined with a lower price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXddwG"&gt;We’ll have to wait till that promised February 2021 launch date from the slide to know for sure. But CES 2021 is right around the corner, and with it comes the possibility of some clarity on Samsung’s Chromebook roadmap for next year and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s deleting ads that mocked Apple for not including a charger in the box</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xT9k5lmNZP2UHqlY_bVoNIBpos=/313x0:2188x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573712/samsung_mocking_apple_no_charger_iphone_12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Samsung (via 9to5Google)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESGDhC"&gt;Samsung has been caught deleting an ad that makes fun of Apple for not including a charging brick with the iPhone 12 — the same thing it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317304/samsung-smartphone-chargers-2021-cost-environment"&gt;rumored to be doing&lt;/a&gt; with its Galaxy S21 phones. The Facebook post was made by Samsung Caribbean back in October, and it had a picture of a charging brick with the caption “Included with your Galaxy” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/23/samsung-apple-charger-removal-post/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Samsung ad including an image with a phone charging brick captioned “Included with your Galaxy”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zzJi48iA6W98DtXxi-fhFmTHg98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193430/samsung_charger_apple_ad_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Samsung (via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Facebook post that has now been deleted, adding even more fuel to the rumors that Samsung won’t be including a charger with its upcoming phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sT6PeX"&gt;This isn’t the first time Samsung has deleted ads after adopting the same practice it previously mocked Apple for. Back when the Galaxy Note 10 launched without a headphone jack, Samsung &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/08/galaxy-note-10-headphone-jack-is-dead-why-and-how-to-embrace-change/"&gt;deleted ads making fun of the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt; for not having a similar plug (ads that were made even more awkward by the fact that the iPhone in the ad was just referred to as the “ten”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iExgNc"&gt;None of this is to say that doing the same thing as Apple is necessarily a bad thing. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758050/samsung-galaxy-note-10-headphone-jack-35mm-usbc-unpacked-event"&gt;had an explanation&lt;/a&gt; as to why it removed the headphone jack, and not including the charger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;could very well be good for the environment&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just not a great look when Samsung is posting ads about including a charger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;only a few months before&lt;/a&gt; it’s expected to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Px1gU"&gt;Despite the awkwardness that the marketing could cause, Samsung could handle this better than Apple did. When Apple removed the charging brick, they also changed the cable that came with the phone: almost every previous iPhone came with a USB-A brick, and the cable included in the iPhone 12’s box was USB-C to Lightning. So the argument of “everyone has a charging brick” fell flat because almost any previous iPhone bricks weren’t compatible with the included cable (though&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHJA3AM%2FA%2F20w-usb-c-power-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F23%2F22197394%2Fsamsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Apple would happily sell customers one for $20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UwMgA"&gt;Samsung’s phones, however, use standard USB-C cables for charging, as opposed to Apple’s proprietary Lighting. This means that the cable that comes with Samsung’s new phone will work with the charging brick that came with last year’s model (though it won’t help people who don’t buy new phones every year, as the Galaxy S10 from two years ago &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExI-hp7d-0g"&gt;came with a USB-A charging brick&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond are finally coming to HBO Max in January</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/trTXL0hBa7YSRzEvP2N9zFtlL8E=/18x0:918x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573641/batman_animated.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8Md2a"&gt;A number of beloved DC titles are moving from DC Universe to HBO Max on January 1st, including &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Batman Beyond. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZh3yh"&gt;Starting in 2021, series and movies like &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Justice League Dark: Apokolips War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Batman: Bad Blood &lt;/em&gt;will become available to HBO Max subscribers. Other DC titles available on other streamers, including &lt;em&gt;Superman: Doomsday &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Superman: Man of Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, will also be available on HBO Max. The full list can be seen on &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-highlights-january-2021"&gt;WarnerMedia’s site.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvyQT2"&gt;The move isn’t too surprising considering DC previously announced its DC Universe streaming service will transform into a comics-exclusive platform, to be called DC Universe Infinite, &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2020/09/18/dc-universe-transforms-into-dc-universe-infinite-the-ultimate-comic-book"&gt;beginning on January 21st&lt;/a&gt;. Shows and films still on DC Universe will make their move over to HBO Max throughout the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lnF8m2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Between ‘The Animated Series,’ ‘Batman Beyond,’ and ‘WandaVision’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Disney Plus, it’s a good time for streaming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TST7T5"&gt;Up until recently, many of the titles were available exclusively on DC Universe, which costs an additional $8 a month. For people who are looking to marathon a bunch of their favorite DC series and films over the holidays, having to maintain two subscriptions — one for DC Universe and another $15 monthly subscription for HBO Max — isn’t ideal. Yet as WarnerMedia puts an additional emphasis on growing HBO Max, offloading DC Universe titles to its newest streaming service will help bolster and keep HBO Max subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGFjl0"&gt;2021 is an important year for WarnerMedia and HBO Max. The company is simultaneously releasing its movies on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day they’re out in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. Executives are hopeful the move will rapidly accelerate the streamer’s subscriber base, which isn’t growing as fast as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528234/hbo-max-subscribers-activations-att-directv-warner"&gt;industry insiders would have liked&lt;/a&gt;. HBO Max will also play host to some big originals, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377320/justice-league-snyder-trailer-fandome-first-look-darkseid-cyborg"&gt;Zack Snyder’s &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl &lt;/em&gt;reboot, among others. Having a number of popular “comfort series” like &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Batman Beyond&lt;/em&gt; may encourage people to keep their HBO Max subscriptions active even after they’ve watched the latest shows and movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NILJL2"&gt;(This is where I strongly recommend HBO Max’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/8/13/21364259/harley-quinn-hbo-max-poison-ivy-animated"&gt;animated &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t seen it yet. It’s the best TV show I’ve watched all year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4U9cmP"&gt;Not to mention that, if you’re like me, you’ve been not-so-quietly asking WarnerMedia to move &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;over for a while. Between &lt;em&gt;The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Batman Beyond&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562411/wandavision-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a good time for streaming, for both DC and Marvel fans. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety means sorting signal from noise  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Scene setter images outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Op-nva1AYMOgGpc9ZP9dEcRVX-A=/0x0:2420x1613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573357/1230138067.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jason Armond / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IF3puX"&gt;With the launch of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, officials expect to see a surge in the number of potential bad vaccine reactions. Their job will be to find out how real those reactions are — finding a signal in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzv3do"&gt;If previous vaccine reports are a guide, the vast majority of the reports won’t end up being real safety issues. But federal officials encourage physicians, especially those who don’t usually give vaccines, to tell the programs about any hint of an issue — because they want to make sure they know about and thoroughly investigate everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmUJZH"&gt;To some degree, the problem has to do with large numbers and the relative novelty of the vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccines are also under intense scrutiny, and both recipients and their doctors are on alert for the slightest of side effects. Tens of millions of people are set to be vaccinated over the next few months. In a normal year, the main vaccine safety system in the US gets around 50,000 reports of potential bad reactions. This year, there may be 10 or 20 times more reports, says Grace Lee, a member of the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="coeC95"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s just going to be more cases, period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ANQPzd"&gt;“There’s just going to be more cases, period, for the COVID-19 vaccine,” says Lee, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16J04H"&gt;The backbone of the vaccine safety program is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a 20-year-old federal tool that tracks side effects for immunizations given in the US. Anyone can report a bad reaction to a vaccine to VAERS, which is jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRPrf3"&gt;Pediatricians tend to be more familiar with the vaccine reporting systems than doctors in other specialties, because they administer childhood vaccinations — and kids get a lot of vaccines. Other types of doctors are less likely to report to VAERS, a study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004283?via%3Dihub"&gt;from the CDC found&lt;/a&gt;. But pediatricians won’t be giving the majority of COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJhcRr"&gt;The CDC has been working with professional organizations of physicians working with older adults and in long-term care facilities to raise awareness of programs such as VAERS, says Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the Vaccine Safety Team on the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force. It’s specifically targeting groups of physicians outside of the agency’s normal VAERS partnerships, he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;To reach nursing homes and long-term care facilities, the CDC is leaning on the National Healthcare Safety Network, which normally tracks health care-related infections in around 17,000 long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZQPLm"&gt;Anecdotally, Lee says she’s heard more and more health care providers in her own hospital system asking about VAERS. She takes that as a sign that the outreach programs are working. “They’re asking all the right questions, so they know of its existence, and they know we’re required to report into it,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMeCfv"&gt;Lee isn’t worried that people won’t report to VAERS — she’s more concerned that too many people will, and that the system will struggle with the sheer number of reports. The authorized COVID-19 vaccines cause side effects like fever and headache, and even mild symptoms could seem concerning to people scrutinizing vaccine recipients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1xp24o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we had a system that only picked up signals when they were real, it wouldn’t be looking hard enough”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VsE7wI"&gt;Nine out of ten safety signals end up not being real problems with a vaccine, Lee says. But experts want the safety monitoring programs to be sensitive. “We don’t want to miss anything,” she says. “If we had a system that only picked up signals when they were real, it wouldn’t be looking hard enough.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPpup8"&gt;Under early tests, the programs seem to be working as they should. In the first week of the US COVID-19 vaccination campaign, health officials flagged six allergic reactions in people receiving the shot. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf"&gt;Other&lt;/a&gt; reactions were also reported to federal officials, CDC epidemiologist Thomas Clark said during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting last weekend. After an investigation, officials determined they weren’t true cases of severe allergic reaction — a sign the system is catching reports and figuring out which are relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jp49zF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under early tests, the programs seem to be working as they should&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eEjAeg"&gt;It’s important to be open about any safety concerns reported, but it’s also important not to raise problems too early that might not end up being real, Lee says. “It’s a really hard balance of when the right time is to let people know there’s been a signal,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmrmiR"&gt;During the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, VAERS will work in tandem with other safety monitoring systems. Those include v-safe, a new text-message based platform that asks COVID-19 vaccine recipients to report how they feel after they get the shot, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project, a national network of experts that consults with doctors on vaccine safety issues. “It’s really all hands on deck,” Lee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NVj78"&gt;The integrated network of safety monitoring programs is one way to make sure experts are actually seeing a safety signal. Any problems flagged through VAERS will be checked against the other tools, such as v-safe, Lee says. “We can look in another system and say ‘Hey, are you seeing that?’” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Into the Spider-Verse is leaving Netflix, and it plays into 2020’s biggest streaming problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-abYhsuxcpk67qdx8DHrCr-k6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572930/SpiderVerse_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony Pictures Animation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eOpAm0"&gt;Two of the biggest movies people want to talk about this week are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s another film that can’t be missed: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFlJur"&gt;Sony’s critically acclaimed 2018 animated superhero movie, which saw Miles Morales step into the web slinger’s suit and save the world with the help of a few other Spider-beings, is leaving &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/23/22197177/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-watch-netflix-dvd-4k-blu-ray"&gt;Netflix on December 25th&lt;/a&gt;. That’s two days from now. It’s also unclear where &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse &lt;/em&gt;will end up. Sony doesn’t have a major streaming platform, and none of the other big streamers — HBO Max, Disney Plus, Peacock, Apple TV Plus, or Amazon Prime Video — have announced that it’s arriving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZwxjh"&gt;Streaming shuffles aren’t new. Movies and TV shows leave Netflix (or Hulu, or HBO Max) every single month. Ephemerality has defined streaming for years. It’s why sites like JustWatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21291519/justwatch-streaming-search-engine-filter-app-impressions-hbo-max-disney-plus-netflix-hulu"&gt;have found massive success&lt;/a&gt;, helping people who flock to Google to find out where the movie they watched on HBO Max has wound up, or why tweet threads about the importance of physical media pop up every single week. (This is where I plug buying Blu-rays if possible, especially because streaming also coincides with impermanence, and titles can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220576/splash-tom-hanks-disney-plus-butt-cgi-hair-streaming-physical-digital"&gt;seemingly be edited at whim&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BkQQMW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is where 2020 becomes especially interesting; it’s the beginning of big, noticeable exclusivity plays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8TKYdy"&gt;Year endings also tend to see more titles leave likely because more licenses expire. This is where 2020 becomes especially interesting; it’s the beginning of big, noticeable exclusivity plays. Before HBO Max, Disney Plus, and Peacock launched, the rights owners were prepared to license their titles to the major streamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6klMDE"&gt;It’s a lucrative business — if you don’t have your own streamer. Netflix paid a reported $300 million for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/100277562"&gt;first-run Disney movies in 2012&lt;/a&gt; (although the deal didn’t kick in until 2016). It was a major milestone moment; Netflix beat out Showtime and Starz for that premium window offering. That “Pay 1 window” becomes a bidding war; think of how movies go from theaters to Blu-ray / digital retailers, and then wind up on HBO before they’re played on broadcast networks like ABC. Netflix signed a similar deal in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/17/4437404/netflix-dreamworks-exclusive-deal"&gt;2013 with DreamWorks Animation&lt;/a&gt;. Back in the early days of the streaming bonanza, it was also fantastic for subscribers. With new mega deals, and one of the biggest TV libraries available that included shows from every major network, Netflix had &lt;em&gt;basically everything &lt;/em&gt;people needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxHp7M"&gt;Everything’s changed now. Netflix is far from the only streamer on the block, and in the United States specifically, it’s facing several waves of new competition. In 2019, television research group Ampere Analysis noted that about 20 percent of Netflix’s library included titles from NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, and WarnerMedia. Three of those companies have since publicly announced the importance of building their own streaming services, taking back much of the content they’ve licensed out to Netflix and other streamers and adding it exclusively to their own products. (The fourth company, Fox, got swallowed up by Disney.) It’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasondashbailey/status/1341048466986954757"&gt;not just Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, but Netflix remains the quintessential example. Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://decider.com/2019/12/04/netflix-film-catalog-shrunk-40-percent-2014"&gt;library is literally shrinking&lt;/a&gt; — something executives have &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/01/netflix-executive-team-shrugs-off-friends-exit-impact-is-nothing-we-can-see-1202837394/"&gt;effectively shrugged off&lt;/a&gt; as Netflix pushes into making more original series and films than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wi6xbu"&gt;That change is as clear as day when looking at Netflix’s list of titles leaving by the end of the year. All seasons of &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt;? Gone. You’ll have to sign up for HBO Max to view those. &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;? Going to need a Premium Peacock subscription to watch any episode from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174856/the-office-netflix-peacock-streaming"&gt;season three through its finale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2 &lt;/em&gt;is about to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18093994/ralph-breaks-the-internet-movie-review-john-c-reilly-sarah-silverman"&gt;become a Disney Plus exclusive&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;Dexter &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Nurse Jackie &lt;/em&gt;will&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;likely find their way to Showtime’s OTT service or whatever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437729/cbs-all-access-paramount-plus-new-name-rebrand-2021-international-disney-hbo"&gt;Paramount Plus is going to be&lt;/a&gt;. (More details on that in the new year.) For those doing the math at home, that means instead of spending $14 a month to watch all of those shows, it’ll now cost approximately $45 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgzWrk"&gt;Movies and TV shows from content owners may still end up on Netflix. NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS have spoken about the importance of licensing while setting up their streaming businesses. But the biggest titles, the ones that executives think people will sign up for, will remain exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AlSwBU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of spending $14 a month to watch all of those shows, it’ll now cost approximately $45 a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cC1gTw"&gt;For companies like Disney and WarnerMedia, it makes sense. I’m sure people are watching &lt;em&gt;Friends &lt;/em&gt;on HBO Max; whether it’s driving subscriber growth remains to be seen. Other titles that WarnerMedia doesn’t need exclusively get sold off somewhere else — like &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/rick-and-morty-season-4-hbo-max-hulu-release-date"&gt;which is also on Hulu&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a similar deal with ViacomCBS, which licensed &lt;em&gt;South Park &lt;/em&gt;to WarnerMedia (it now streams on HBO Max) for &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/south-park-stream-exclusively-hbo-max-1203387212/"&gt;more than $500 million&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the rights will revert back to the original content holders, and they’ll do another calculus as to where &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt; can make them the most money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNrh8U"&gt;What’s impossible to ignore, however, is how much our streaming experiences have changed in less than a decade. It used to be that if you wanted to watch something, there was a 90 percent chance Netflix had it. If Netflix didn’t, it was probably on Hulu. Now, it practically takes a college degree in content ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94Stg4"&gt;All of which is a long way of saying, “Who knows where &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse &lt;/em&gt;will end up?” So, if you want to watch it on Netflix, do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhX3OJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjF0c3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehawwd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qd5qqy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ACLU is suing for more information about the FBI’s phone-hacking lab</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wNRkrtmqPhSWfHDOeKkSJXnty8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572501/acastro_180109_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGKIVx"&gt;On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a new lawsuit demanding information about the FBI’s Electronic Device Analysis Unit (EDAU) — a forensic unit that the ACLU believes has been quietly breaking the iPhone’s local encryption systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFP3QN"&gt;“The FBI is secretly breaking the encryption that secures our cell phones and laptops from identity thieves, hackers, and abusive governments,” the ACLU said &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/the-fbi-is-secretly-breaking-into-encrypted-devices-were-suing/"&gt;in a statement announcing the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, “and it refuses to even acknowledge that it has information about these efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdnXlh"&gt;The FBI has made few public statements about the EDAU, but the lawsuit cites a handful of cases in which prosecutors have submitted a “Mobile Device Unlock Request” and received data from a previously locked phone. The EDAU also put in public requests for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/9/17550970/apple-ios-usb-restricted-mode-iphone-passcode-cracking-bypassed-usb-accessory"&gt;the GrayKey devices&lt;/a&gt; that found success unlocking a previous version of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsSWeJ"&gt;In June 2018, the ACLU filed a FOIA request for records relating to the EDAU, but the FBI has refused to confirm any records even exist. After a string of appeals within the FOIA process, the group is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-v-department-justice-complaint-injunctive-relief?redirect=aclu-v-department-justice-complaint-injunctive-relief"&gt;taking the issue to federal court&lt;/a&gt;, calling on the attorney general and FBI inspector general to directly intervene and make the records available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HVt4V"&gt;“We’re demanding the government release records concerning any policies applicable to the EDAU, its technological capabilities to unlock or access electronic devices, and its requests for, purchases of, or uses of software that could enable it to bypass encryption,” the ACLU said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDW8TM"&gt;For years, Apple has promoted its iOS disk encryption as a powerful protection against identity theft and unauthorized access — a crucial reassurance as more and more sensitive data is routed through our phones. Apple’s insistence on robust data security has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/12/10749806/encryption-debate-fbi-terrorism-going-dark"&gt;brought it into conflict with the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, which has repeatedly pressured the company to build a backdoor into its system, most notably in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11325030/apple-fbi-iphone-hack-security-encryption-what-comes-next"&gt;the San Bernardino case&lt;/a&gt;. The FBI’s current capability to break iOS encryption remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom may launch an email service and calendar app to compete with Google and Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrtrlNpAmcag-yDlGK1rDKNV5JE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572093/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EXWZEp"&gt;Videoconferencing platform Zoom has had a blockbuster year, with its stock price rising more than 500 percent due to the unprecedented surge in remote work brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. But now the company is looking to expand beyond workplace video chat and into new territories, specifically email and calendar services, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/buoyed-by-video-success-zoom-explores-email-calendar-services"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEo54i"&gt;The company is already working on the email product, which the report states will be a web email service Zoom may begin testing as early as next year. The calendar app appears farther off and it’s unclear if development has even started. But both ideas are smart avenues for Zoom to explore, especially if companies start bringing employees back to the office and reliance on videoconferencing declines as COVID-19 vaccine distribution picks up through 2021. Zoom declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZwfDI"&gt;Many of Zoom’s major competitors are videoconferencing platforms bundled as part of broader enterprise app suites, with the two biggest ones belonging to Microsoft with its Office 365 platform and Google with its competing Workspace bundle. Both of those platforms offer calendar, email, and videoconferencing products, so it makes sense Zoom would look to email and calendar to try to round out its offerings and make Zoom less of single-purpose platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvOcYe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report has a number of other telling signs the company is interested in building a full enterprise app suite, including job postings for “exciting chat features” and its existing integrations with other apps like Asana and Dropbox. But there is always the possibility the company decides to wait and see how the shift back to office work affects businesses and whether remote work remains a prominent factor of life well into the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJUzH7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 2:58PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that Zoom declined to comment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The CDC says the top global health story of 2020 was mosquitoes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anopheles Stephensi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbxjUN9fSM8tqEyvLbODICnOxxA=/18x0:5283x3510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571975/938660572.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iMnYNX"&gt;Like they do every December, websites across the internet are rounding up their best posts and stories from the year. That includes the website for the Center for Global Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which highlighted its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/newsletter/2020/december-21-2020.html"&gt;top five stories&lt;/a&gt; for 2020. And coming in at the number one spot, the health agency picked... mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGAFF8"&gt;Specifically, it picked its recognition of World Mosquito Day, where the center called attention to a mosquito species called &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which spreads malaria. It’s certainly an interesting choice, considering the CDC spent the year battling a global pandemic. Not to knock mosquitoes! They’re very important, and they’re very deadly. But COVID-19 didn’t even make the number two slot — it clocked in at number three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV58bc"&gt;Infectious disease and global health experts on Twitter found it interesting, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K7PLlL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh my goodness. Did a mosquito write this list?&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Michaud (@joshmich) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshmich/status/1341505174540574722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="tQuN7z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"#1:  The Spread of Anopheles stephensi and the Fight Against the World’s Deadliest Animal"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cdc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CDC&lt;/a&gt; surprising choice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;December 21, 2020: Top 5 Global Health Stories of 2020 &lt;a href="https://t.co/rCHa3wiWmw"&gt;https://t.co/rCHa3wiWmw&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDCgov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CDCgov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Sax (@PaulSaxMD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PaulSaxMD/status/1341567501054976000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNu2A8"&gt;The Center for Global Health didn’t say what its methodology was for this ranking, so we can’t be sure how the list ended up ranked the way it did. The CDC could be tracking page views. Or maybe it’s a sign of self awareness from the agency, which made a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/cdc-coronavirus.html"&gt;number of missteps&lt;/a&gt; stateside that contributed to the horrible US response to the pandemic. Maybe the people building the list were just sick of COVID-19. No clear answers here. But congrats to the mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government blacklisted DJI drones, but some drone companies are more confused than worried</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gvZpD7rPkqUKZddwxa000Q-nyk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571797/vpavic_042029_4003_0144.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydf6LW"&gt;Last week, the US Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put Chinese drone maker DJI&lt;/a&gt; on its Entity List, limiting how it can work with US companies. The news startled DJI’s huge American user base, including companies that rely on DJI for entire fleets of commercial drones. But it’s likely less onerous than it initially sounded — even if, like many Trump administration decisions, it comes with a dose of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78UycQ"&gt;The Trump administration has repeatedly used sanctions to crack down on Chinese tech giants, sometimes on nebulous or disputed grounds. It banned US companies from dealing with Huawei and ZTE, and it’s pursued confusing, legally ambiguous bans on the Chinese social apps WeChat and TikTok. While the Entity List is primarily meant for restricting companies that threaten national security, DJI is being censured for enabling “wide-scale human rights abuses within China,” following reports that it &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-26/dji-s-drone-supremacy-comes-at-a-price?srnd=economics-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;provided surveillance drones&lt;/a&gt; for Chinese detention camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z7LQYr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Banning DJI would devastate the US drone industry — but that’s seemingly not happening&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VV5wwD"&gt;Completely banning DJI drones would be a catastrophic blow to the industry — but early indications suggest that’s not happening. DJI dominates hobbyist and commercial small drone sales, thanks to its comparatively low prices, sophisticated designs, and early entry to the market. “It’s the equivalent of taking Apple out of the smartphone game,” says Daniel Windham, a geographic information system (GIS) specialist who works with DJI drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyOtiy"&gt;After the announcement, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22190097/dji-blacklist-ban-xinjiang-entity-list-trump"&gt;DJI asserted&lt;/a&gt; that Americans could still buy its products. “DJI is disappointed in the US Department of Commerce’s decision. Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1yctf"&gt;That tallies with other companies’ interpretation of the order. “The challenge with the order has been just figuring it out,” says Mike Winn, CEO of drone data analysis company DroneDeploy. “Our understanding, after talking to lots of experts and lawyers, is that US companies are restricted from exporting US technologies.” Companies can get around this by applying for a license — something that has allowed Intel, for instance, to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/intel-huawei/intel-gets-u-s-licences-to-supply-some-products-to-huawei-idUSKCN26D0I3"&gt;continue working&lt;/a&gt; with Huawei. “I think in the short term, we don’t see a big problem here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="itZgnB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At this point, we simply don’t have enough data.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QISYvZ"&gt;Limiting engagement with DJI could still cause trouble for companies that sell components to the company, and it could force DJI to adapt its supply chain. But for people buying, using, and reselling the drones, it would be less of a problem. “Often, this type of order restricts a foreign company from purchasing US products. If that is the case, there would be zero impact,” says Kerry Garrison, general manager of drone vendor Multicopter Warehouse. Garrison notes that the federal government had already placed restrictions on buying the Chinese-made drones, although it could cause larger problems if the government bans using federal grants to buy them. “At this time, we simply don’t have enough data yet to really know for sure what this will all amount to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49Zkpt"&gt;The Trump administration announced its ban just a month before President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office, and it’s unclear what tack Biden will take toward the drone maker. But Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, believes there’s not much political appetite for loosening restrictions on China. “Any of these actions that they would reverse would have a political cost,” Chorzempa says. And since DJI isn’t accused of violating a concrete sanctions rule or creating a specific technical vulnerability, there’s not a simple fix for getting taken off the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shoq97"&gt;Even if the ban stands, though, DJI’s business may be unusually well-structured to withstand cutoffs. “While I’m sure there’s going to be some changes for DJI, they are a very highly vertically integrated company and they produce a lot of their own hardware,” says Winn. DJI’s drones benefit immensely from US-made software applications, but these are built on top of DJI’s own software development kit. It’s not tied to an American-made operating system the way that phone maker Huawei depended on Google — a dependence that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;locked phone buyers out&lt;/a&gt; of popular Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QD11Oa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivals have still called to “think twice” about using DJI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TaTneO"&gt;Some competitors have nonetheless hailed the DJI ban as an opportunity. The decision “sends an unmistakable signal to the marketplace: companies should think twice about doing business with a known violator of human rights,” said Brendan Groves, the policy head at rival drone company Skydio. Similarly, open-source drone platform Auterion argued that the blacklisting would make “every transaction” with DJI a legal risk, pushing businesses toward US-made alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRgqpO"&gt;But Winn doesn’t think DJI will be supplanted anytime soon. “We think it’s very exciting that there are more options. But the reality is that DJI has about 75 percent market share.” If it were truly shut out of the American market, it would leave a “big, big hole” to fill. “We don’t yet know of a company that could do that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 review: powerful portable gaming</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great gaming rig and an okay laptop&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hARC30"&gt;If you’re looking for the absolute most powerful gaming hardware out there... well, you don’t want the Asus ROG Strix Scar 15. You want a desktop or a laptop that weighs seven pounds, requires multiple power bricks, and is basically a desktop. But if you still want something you can realistically carry around, the Strix is about as powerful as it gets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cwetf"&gt;We’ve reviewed a number of Asus laptops this year that are members of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price#:~:text=Asus%20ROG%20Zephyrus%20G14%20specs&amp;amp;text=Speaking%20of%20the%20touchpad%20and,sturdy%2C%20with%20very%20little%20flex."&gt;ROG Zephyrus gaming line&lt;/a&gt; — powerful, while still portable and attractive. You’d buy a Zephyrus if you want decent gaming results but also want an everyday work machine you could bring into the office or class. The Strix line eschews the latter role. These are gaming laptops. They are just for games. They’re not cheap, they’re not subtle, and they hold nothing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Close-up of the ROG Strix logo on the Strix Scar 15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFPvN4jbdg4Fv03-vpjPWA8h18c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183651/mchin_190314_4347_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Strike. Slay. Stun.” is the Strix Scar’s motto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zUSwu"&gt;That’s where the Strix Scar 15 stands out. Every aspect is designed with the gaming enthusiast in mind, and there are a number of unique features for those customers. Of course, those also come with a few trade-offs — and folks who might need to use their machine for tasks besides gaming should consider other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D1Eslb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10248257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iFFcBD"&gt;The Strix Scar 15 starts at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/search?q=rog%20strix%20scar%2015&amp;amp;s_c=1"&gt;$2,199.99&lt;/a&gt; on the Asus store. The &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202006AM100000008"&gt;base model&lt;/a&gt; comes with a Core i7-10875H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super, 1GB of SSD storage, and a 240Hz screen. The model we’re looking at today is a significant step up from that: it costs &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202007AM150000006"&gt;$2,799.99&lt;/a&gt; and is powered by Intel’s eight-core Core i9-10980HK and an RTX 2070 Super, which are joined by 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and a 1920 x 1080 300Hz screen (3ms response time). The 10980HK is a workhorse — it’s one of the most powerful mobile chips on the market — and 300Hz is the fastest display you can get on a 15-inch laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Strix Scar 15 seen at a 135-degree angle." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aTzXemr0v3qrt3uxufTnb2q6HSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183653/mchin_190314_4347_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the design was inspired by a collaboration with BMW Designworks Group. See it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X80o4X"&gt;If you clicked on this review, you’re probably most curious about the frame rates this laptop is putting up. Suffice to say: they’re good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VPXwV"&gt;On &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; at maximum settings, the Strix Scar averaged 248fps. Thanks to this model’s 300Hz screen, the chips aren’t just rendering 248fps; you’re actually seeing 248fps. You’ll see a frame rate difference between this system and an identical one with a 240Hz display, albeit a small one. (But to folks who play a lot of esports and first-person shooters, a small difference can matter.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UDX7az"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The chips aren’t just rendering 248fps — you’re actually seeing 248fps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rW7ge8"&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;CS:GO &lt;/em&gt;was a smooth experience. The Scar only dipped below 100fps once when I was running through a thick flurry of dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXX38n"&gt;Not all titles are able to take full advantage of the 300Hz screen, unless you plan on bumping the quality settings down. The Strix put up 67fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s highest settings with ray tracing on Ultra. On &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt; (one of the most demanding games out there) cranked up to Ultra, the Scar averaged 54fps. Both games were quite playable on those settings, without any stuttering or slowdown. Those results are right on par with the MSI GE66 Raider (which put up 50fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;and 70fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;) and beat the smaller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; by a significant margin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the ROG Strix Scar 15 review." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qdvjcXIH0uL3-zLL2M1iC2ClaiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183656/mchin_190314_4347_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can connect a G-Sync monitor via USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 from the back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t31NeL19hhWHFmS_xsfq1oTMIh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183655/mchin_190314_4347_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With HDMI 2.0b, you can view content at up to 60Hz on a connected 4K monitor or TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FZ2Zks"&gt;It’s worth noting that while I was letting the Scar rip in Turbo mode (the highest power profile available) the 10980HK got quite hot throughout my gaming session, spending a chunk of time in the mid-90s and even hitting 99 degrees Celsius a couple of times. When I swapped to the regular Performance profile, the CPU spent more time in the mid-high 80s, and I only saw a 1-2fps difference as a result. So if you’re worried about frying your hardware, you won’t miss much if you stay on the Performance profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sXeShN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 10980HK got quite hot throughout my gaming session&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VP2QZ1"&gt;Moving on to other laptop stuff. Apart from its chips, what distinguishes the Strix Scar 15 as a gaming laptop is the design. It features a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, a luminous logo on the lid, and a bright LED strip around the front three sides. A glowing strip may seem obnoxious, but this one is actually more subdued than strips you may have seen on gaming rigs like MSI’s GE66 Raider. It wraps around the underside of the deck, so you don’t see it full-on; the effect is less garish gamer than the GE66 Raider and more fancy nightclub. (You can turn all of the RGB stuff off, of course. But then, what’s the point?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XsFFNA"&gt;Another cool thing is the deck design, which is printed with what Asus calls “Cybertext.” Basically, Republic of Gamers is written all over it in an urban-chic sort of font. It’s subtle and far from distracting, but it gives the whole product a subtle sci-fi vibe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHnaHM"&gt;Speaking of the keyboard deck: the palm rests are coated in a unique “soft-touch paint.” It’s much smoother than your typical palm rest (you can very much feel the difference when you touch the rest of the chassis) and is quite nice to lay your hands on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y815DN"&gt;Asus keyboards are often among my favorites, and the Strix Scar’s keyboard is no exception. I love typing on this. I feel like my fingers are flying while using it. There’s a satisfying click with very little resistance. And I especially appreciate the convenient row of hotkeys at the top, which includes volume controls, a microphone mute, one that changes the performance profile, and another button that brings up Armoury Crate (Asus’ app where you can adjust various settings and features). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bwx9P7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You have a good port selection at your disposal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47EDtA"&gt;If you’d rather plug in your own peripherals, you have a good port selection at your disposal. There are three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports and an audio jack on the left side, while the back houses one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port (which supports DisplayPort, but not PD charging), the charging port, one LAN RJ-45, and one HDMI 2.0. That’s most of what you’ll need but there’s one glaring omission: Thunderbolt. Plenty of people may not care about this, but it’s a port I’m disappointed not to see on a $2,799 laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpRAtR"&gt;On the right side is a Keystone II reader. A Keystone II is a physical key on which you can save personal settings. You can also use it to access a private storage space, which Asus refers to as a “shadow drive.” This can be encrypted if you have Windows 10 Pro. (Only this model ships with that operating system. You’ll need to upgrade from Windows 10 Home if you buy the base configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The lid of the Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a9GgQF5vOtkTJ7Xe7w_VshYEvfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183660/mchin_190315_4347_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can link a shadow drive to multiple keystones to share access or create backups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9jUfqX"&gt;The Keystone II is a neat idea considering how many settings and profiles there are to keep track of on the Strix. In the ROG app GameVisual, you can choose between color presets for different types of games (FPS mode enhances brightness and contrast, RPG mode prioritizes vivid colors, etc.). In Aura Creator, you can customize your keyboard’s colors and animation. In GameFirst VI, you can prioritize bandwidth between the programs you have running; there are presets like Gaming First, Live Streaming First, and Multimedia First.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="mgdyqq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Keystone II is a neat idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t6uAS6"&gt;One more thing I like: the speakers. Music sounded great, with a nice surround quality. The Strix won’t replace a good external speaker and percussion was a bit tinny. But vocals were quite clear, and at maximum volume, I never heard distortion. The laptop’s fans get quite loud during gaming, but I had no trouble hearing my games’ audio over them. (You can also switch to the Silent profile if the whine is bothering you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Close-up of the LED strip on the Asus ROG Strix Scar 15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69glPYacI8MQwpTqEHpWWYpRrgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183650/mchin_190314_4347_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says its “smart amp” technology makes real-time adjustments to the Strix’s speaker output to minimize distortion and prevent damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="thBI83"&gt;There’s lots of good stuff on the Strix, as you can see. But there are trade-offs, too. Most of them aren’t super relevant to gaming (and thus, forgivable on a laptop like the Strix), but they’re worth bearing in mind nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvz9YJ"&gt;For one: there’s no webcam. It’s not a deal-breaker — streamers will be using their own equipment anyway — but it’s a big minus for anyone who would otherwise use the Strix for an occasional work meeting or virtual catch-up with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xEaInJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10248274"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K145jC"&gt;I also have a couple of issues with the trackpad. It has discrete clickers, which require a bit more skittering around to press than integrated buttons. I like these particular clickers more than most, but they’re still easy to miss and I sometimes found myself whacking chassis when trying to click. Generally, I found it less responsive and less accurate than I wanted it to be. Occasionally, it thought I was clicking when I wasn’t, causing me to accidentally drag things everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6sPfL"&gt;The touchpad also has a nifty feature where it can morph into an LED number pad if you press an integrated NumLock button in the top-right corner — but I hit this button with my palm while typing and accidentally activated the Numpad several times. Unlike with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ ZenBooks&lt;/a&gt; that also have this feature, you can’t navigate with the touchpad while the Numpad is up, so I kept having to interrupt my workflow to deactivate it. (You can disable the touchpad itself with F10, but there’s not an easy way to disable the NumPad without disabling the touchpad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPbHvr"&gt;The biggest downside, though, is battery life. I averaged two hours and 28 minutes of sustained multitasking and office work with the Strix on the Battery Saver profile with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. (With all the battery-saving features off and a slightly heavier load, I got as low as one hour.) The Strix is a gaming laptop, so I wasn’t expecting hours upon hours of juice. Still, plenty of competitors do better: The MSI GE66 Raider (also powering an LED strip and RGB keyboard) made it through four hours of that same workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Evt1jx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10248279"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMRCnB"&gt;Gaming on battery is possible, but not great. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;ran mostly in the high teens and low 20s. I got an hour and 15 minutes of the game on a charge, but I started to see stuttering when the Strix was down to 60 percent (about half an hour in) and the game became unplayable at 10 percent. Realistically, if you plan on bringing the Scar anywhere, you’ll need to bring the massive 280W adapter and spend some time charging the device. (It took 45 minutes to charge up to 60 percent during very light Chrome use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPHWTO"&gt;Overall, these nitpicks emphasize Asus’ priority with the Scar. It’s not a laptop that’s meant to double as a travel companion or a work-from-home driver — don’t buy it to be your primary PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix Scar keyboard and touchpad seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWsp4RQkgOp05sBWK83_UiqjnPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183659/mchin_190315_4347_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See that “NumLK” thing in the top-right corner? The NumPad pops up if you tap that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8UlXaM"&gt;But that doesn’t mean the Scar isn’t great at what it’s supposed to be great at, which is gaming. Its results are on par with those of the best 15-inch rigs on the market, and it offers useful customization software with a unique colorful design to boot. If you need the best frame rates and the fastest screen, the Strix Scar 15 is a fine purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
