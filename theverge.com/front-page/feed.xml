    <title>Bezos says Amazon workers aren’t treated like robots, unveils robotic plan to keep them working</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bezos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eXTdjHdx4jW98MgWPk9XpMlGoSM=/0x0:400x267/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131508/bezos-square.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uU5Mw6"&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders?"&gt;his final letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt; as CEO that the e-commerce giant has to “do a better job for our employees.” The letter comes amid ongoing reports of untenable conditions for Amazon workers. And it outlines a strategy that seems odd for a company that has been accused of treating workers like robots: a robotic scheme that will develop new staffing schedules using an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v70U3m"&gt;Bezos pushed back on the idea that, according to news reports, Amazon doesn’t care for its employees. “In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qof4z7"&gt;To address concerns about working conditions, Bezos said the company will develop new staffing schedules “that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks.” The technology will roll out throughout 2021, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxUJIA"&gt;In addition to giving a nod to working conditions at Amazon, the letter is the first time Bezos has publicly addressed the failed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;union drive at its Bessemer, Alabama plant&lt;/a&gt;. “Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t,” Bezos wrote. “I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better &lt;em&gt;vision&lt;/em&gt; for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBgvu6"&gt;Amazon issued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;a rare public apology&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;was caught publicly lying&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) that its workers have not ever had to pee in water bottles to meet their work demands. This is &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;a well-documented issue at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;how it robotically tracks and fires&lt;/a&gt; workers. An Amazon worker &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as recently as late March that bathroom breaks (or the lack of) were still a problem. “You’re sitting there and you have to go take a piss, but you don’t want to rack up ‘time off task,’” the worker said. In addition, Amazon is facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353929/lawsuit-alleges-amazon-failed-breaks-overtime-wages"&gt;a lawsuit over workers’ missed lunch breaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7akVHn"&gt;Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union that led the Bessemer unionization drive, said in a statement Thursday that the impact of the union drive, regardless of the outcome, has been “devastating” for Amazon’s reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiaM2q"&gt;“We have initiated a global debate about the way Amazon treats its employees,” Appelbaum wrote. “Bezos’s admission today demonstrates that what we have been saying about workplace conditions is correct. But his admission won’t change anything, workers need a union &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; not just another Amazon public relations effort in damage control.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game studio layoffs mean a hellish race against the clock for immigrant developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQVxgs9v2dEnXkN5_uvSA2sp4D4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131452/acastro_210415_4534_gameDevVisas_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;When losing a job becomes a deportation risk&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VG8x6Y"&gt;The layoffs happened suddenly. One day, Jose Abalos was employed, working on &lt;em&gt;Disney Infinity 4&lt;/em&gt;. The next day, he was not. “It was something that upended everything, everything, all kinds of security,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Everything just went belly-up in a single day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd8Gzd"&gt;In May 2016, Disney Interactive shut down its internal studio, Avalanche Software, putting almost &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-10-disney-ceases-publishing-console-games-shutters-infinity"&gt;300 employees&lt;/a&gt; out of work. For Abalos, there was an extra complication. He was working in the states on an H-1B1 visa, a limited program for workers in Singapore and Chile, that requires renewal every year. Abalos only had a month until his visa expired. Not only would he not get the padding of unemployment benefits for anything beyond that date, like his colleagues, but his visa would soon be void, forcing him to leave the country. His life went from “‘Hey, we’re working on &lt;em&gt;Infinity 4&lt;/em&gt;, and this is awesome,’ to ‘Oh, shit. I need to find a job, like, now,’” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Itc4C"&gt;Every year, developers immigrate to the United States to pursue careers in game development. For some people, like Abalos who grew up in Chile, the US offers more opportunity than their home countries, where development communities can be small. According to the Entertainment Software Association’s 2020 economic impact report, the US industry alone supports 143,000 jobs directly. It is home to major developers like Electronic Arts, Valve, and Activision Blizzard across cities big and small, including New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, and Raleigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z0NAup"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Whoever wants to take me, I’ll do it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwshuY"&gt;Regardless of location, however, maintaining a successful game development career is always a challenge. Every year, studios suffer major layoffs, uprooting the lives of their employees. For immigrant workers, the problem is more complex. They don’t just lose a job. They might be forced to abandon their lives entirely and leave the country. This fear trickles down into different aspects of their careers, limiting where developers can afford to take jobs and how much leverage they have to ask for better pay or work conditions once they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V570ZA"&gt;“It was every day, just desperately looking at job searches,” Abalos says. “Whoever wants to take me, I’ll do it.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUZ0AB"&gt;For developers here on visas, time is of the essence. In October 2020, Jennifer Scheurle lost her job suddenly after the project she’d been working on was canceled. Under her O-1 visa, which is given to people with “extraordinary ability or achievement,” she had only 60 days to transfer her visa to another company or leave the country. She started her job hunt that day. “Within the games industry, specifically, getting hired within two to three months is just not a thing, or really rare and difficult to do,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8thFO"&gt;Her health insurance would run out in roughly two weeks. “I lost my ability to go and see my therapist because I didn’t have coverage anymore, which is tough when you’re trying to figure out how to get your life in order,” she says. The project she’d poured her heart into for years was suddenly gone. Her life was thrown into a pressurized timeline of just 60 days, which she says is just not enough. “You have zero time to process what just happened to you. You have zero time to just understand what that means for your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0CRZj"&gt;The process can — and usually does — take months. Recruiters typically wait to attract a wide pool of candidates, who then go through an intensive screening and interview process. Developers may ask a candidate to meet large swaths of their teams, which adds up to hours of interviews. (Pre-COVID, this usually meant in-person gauntlets where a prospective hire could come to the company’s campus for an eight-hour day. As the industry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222465/coronavirus-game-developers-work-from-home-bungie-riot"&gt;works from home&lt;/a&gt;, more of that process is now relegated to video calls.) The long production time on video games, which take years to build, means companies must carefully consider who they want to bring on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MoKbuJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have zero time to process what just happened to you.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OMIQkB"&gt;Scheurle describes a loss of agency in her own life. “I felt like it was not on my own terms,” she says. “I was forced into terms and decisions dictated by this timeline and the [US visa process], instead of me having a minute to think about what I want next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVkwaG"&gt;Contributions from immigrant developers are crucial to maintaining a diverse, and therefore strong, workforce. Employers want to cast a wide net, a recruiter within the games industry tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;; it’s in a company’s best interest to explore talents, technical and artistic, that are vastly different from what they might find in the US alone. It’s impossible to directly track how this loss of talent impacts projects, both those being made now and yet to come. But that loss does exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PhdJE"&gt;Problems don’t just apply to developers in the midst of their careers, but also to young developers hoping to find a job out of college. Raj* came to the States as a student and was, by all accounts, on a successful path. His game was nominated for student awards and received press coverage and accolades. With a strong portfolio and plans to publish his game, he hoped to start a visa process that would help him stay in the country. His team’s dreams for publishing through Nintendo, however, and later a crowdfunding effort, fell through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="pypB6E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was a very real concern ... I could mistakenly end up in a border camp”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KOx2Vn"&gt;It was late April, and his visa was set to expire in May. He’d recently gotten engaged. At the behest of his lawyers, he was told not to leave the country, but rather start the green card process and try for parole that would allow him to stay in the country past his visa’s expiration. “We dropped everything to get this done within the two weeks we had,” Raj says. Instead of spending the year planning his wedding, he and his fiancé held a short ceremony in his in-laws’ backyard. His parents weren’t able to attend, but instead Skyped in. “We had to get everyone on the same page so quickly but we managed it somehow, and got the application submitted within time. Now I just had to wait.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70bQjG"&gt;And he did, for nearly seven months. The initial estimate of three months had stretched on, as complications arose from Trump administration policies. In the meantime, he was unable to take on any work. He was told “to stay indoors as much as possible so as to stay away from ICE agents. There was a very real concern on my lawyer’s end that I could mistakenly end up in a border camp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrFTgW"&gt;That time was challenging for Raj, a self-proclaimed nervous wreck who was “basically under house arrest” for fear of being deported. “I’d now been in the US for months on end with an expired visa and we were terrified we’d hear a knock on the door and it would be an ICE agent,” he says. “I had no idea how long this would continue, or when we’d run out of money. I knew I wasn’t doing well mentally at this point but we couldn’t afford therapy, and I no longer had access to any form of insurance, nor could I apply for any.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbnyTO"&gt;The problem is compounded by the need for many developers who come to the US on visas to have senior-level experience or positions already, the recruiter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Their on-paper qualifications and even country of origin vastly impact the kind of visa they might be able to apply for. Even with a job offer, some developers have had to forfeit those positions because the company couldn’t work out visa issues. Contract work is often inaccessible to developers not able to work in the US. “It’s an impossible fucking process where we lose out on talent on such a massive scale,” Scheurle says. Developers with less experience aren’t allowed to work in positions that might get them the skills they need to ascend to senior talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMkYXk"&gt;It also keeps developers from seeking out smaller companies that might afford them better or more creative opportunities in favor of a larger developer with a bigger bank. To get a visa, any visa, costs thousands of dollars and the help of a good immigration lawyer; some visas, like H-1B, follow strict timelines and approval caps. There’s little margin for error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iktF9n"&gt;“At the end of the day, the company also has to make a request for the visa, and the smaller companies just don’t know how to deal with it,” Abalos says. “Whereas a big company, like, say, Activision or Ubisoft, they have entire departments that deal only with that. That’s their sole purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Ua1u"&gt;It’s an exhausting amount of pressure. “There were points, like, why do I even keep bother trying?” Abalos says. “I mean, should I just start focusing instead on packing everything up and leaving.” Scheurle says the experience made her doubtful that she’d ever want to return to the States. “I love the US and the people as a place,” she says. “I just don’t ever want to go through that again. I want to be somewhere where people appreciate the humanity and what it means to move countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jCJlkL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The stories we don’t hear are even more frightening, even more tragic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mlRZc"&gt;Abalos was able to find a job and stay in the country, while Scheurle took a job in Vancouver. Raj still works in games today but says the trauma of his visa struggles continues to affect him. “I still have episodes now and then, and I can’t cope with high pressure environments like I used to,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqNUfq"&gt;Many of the developers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to still consider themselves to be privileged cases, whether because of their race, education, or financial status. They call themselves examples of best-case scenarios: people who either managed to stay in the country or found lucrative jobs elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsdoMS"&gt;Reflecting on his own experience, Raj, too, sees what he considers privileges. “I would have been deported a hundred times over without all the advantages I had,” he says, pointing to things like his industry accolades, financial support from his family, and access to an immigration lawyer. He calls his ordeal a hellish experience, but still one with positive outcomes that include a happy marriage. “I know from hearing what friends have also gone through that the stories we don’t hear are even more frightening, even more tragic.” The US, in particular, became a harder place for any immigrant to work under Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ZFKVPO"&gt;“I hope that in sharing my story,” Raj says, “a story where things ‘worked out,’ it helps people have more understanding and empathy for the ones that didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuXjFc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Name has been changed to protect the individual’s identity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLxzgR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSRVj1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter begins analyzing harmful impacts of its algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXYPaijXBcGwZWhmOzmNGPFdyTc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131231/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kCijza"&gt;Twitter is starting a new initiative, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-responsible-machine-learning-initiative.html"&gt;Responsible Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;, to assess any “unintentional harms” caused by its algorithms. A team of engineers, researchers, and data scientists across the company will study how Twitter’s use of machine learning can lead to algorithmic biases that negatively impact users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68rLo"&gt;One of the first tasks is an assessment of racial and gender bias in Twitter’s image cropping algorithm. Twitter users have pointed out that its auto-cropped photo previews seem to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;favor white faces over Black faces&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;began testing&lt;/a&gt; displaying full images rather than cropped previews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nznhs"&gt;The team will also look at how timeline recommendations differ across racial subgroups and analyze content recommendations across political ideologies in different countries. Twitter says it will “work closely” with third-party academic researchers and will share results of its analyses and ask for feedback from the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vab6yV"&gt;It’s not clear how much impact the findings will have. Twitter says they “may not always translate into visible product changes,” instead simply leading to “heightened awareness and important discussions” about how the company uses machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXjWVP"&gt;Twitter’s decision to analyze its own algorithms for bias follows other social networks like Facebook, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333405/facebook-instagram-racial-bias-equity-team-formed-ai-algorithms"&gt;formed similar teams in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304960/congress-algorithmic-accountability-act-wyden-clarke-booker-bill-introduced-house-senate"&gt;ongoing pressure&lt;/a&gt; from lawmakers to keep companies’ algorithmic bias in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpJvcy"&gt;Twitter is also in the early stages of exploring “algorithmic choice,” which will potentially allow people to have more input into what content is served to them. CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms"&gt;said in February&lt;/a&gt; that he envisions an “app-store-like view of ranking algorithms,” from which people will be able to choose which algorithms control their feeds. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge’s new Kids Mode is ideal for shared family PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Edge Kids Mode" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZCDSI84GG8SA4tuD81zp1cFiqc=/80x0:958x585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131123/KM_news_feed.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NEXWTJ"&gt;Microsoft is launching a new Kids Mode for its Edge browser today. It’s built directly into Microsoft Edge on Windows and macOS as a free option that’s simple to enable and doesn’t require much work for parents to manage. The mode can be enabled by selecting it from the Edge profile option, and it will lock kids into the Edge browser with access only to approved sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HwJh4"&gt;“It’s a free, protected online environment for kids 12 and under that gives parents peace of mind when their kids browse the web on a shared device,” explains Divya Kumar, product director of Microsoft Edge, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeTCvOuBM_6fk6JhamLQpIMinJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445703/accessing_Kids_Mode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids Mode in Microsoft Edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rFYCHz"&gt;Microsoft really designed this Kids Mode around the scenario where parents might hand a laptop over to a child to let them browse the web. Once you trigger Kids Mode, there’s an option to select between five to eight years or nine to 12 years. Both age ranges include the highest level of tracking prevention in Edge and strict Bing SafeSearch to filter out adult text, images, and videos from searches. Microsoft has provided 70 popular kids sites on an automatic allow list, but parents will have to individually add any additional sites on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDretV"&gt;This special mode actually restricts popular Windows keyboard shortcuts from working to prevent kids from exiting out, but the same shortcut restrictions aren’t in place on macOS, unfortunately. Once Kids Mode is enabled, an adult will have to input their Windows or macOS credentials to exit out and switch back to their normal browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sy7Fub8tzeNTLUN9VaHs4xnrkDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445678/Kids_Mode_blocked_site.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids Mode prompt to allow a website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ebDZqn"&gt;If a child attempts to view a site not on the list, there’s a block page where they can ask for permission from the adult. As this is privacy-focused and localized to the device, Kids Mode doesn’t require a Microsoft Account, nor will it sync your list of approved websites across devices. Unfortunately, that means you’ll have to set up multiple lists if you have more than one shared PC or laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgNXE8"&gt;The higher nine-to-12 age range also includes a news feed on the new tab page in Kids Mode, with curated articles from MSN for Kids. This won’t be current news, or the chance for your child to delve into politics at a young age, as the topics will be more focused on science, fun facts, and animals rather than the latest on the pandemic or geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXaEnewmxn4tt_fZu_-hTWAVgZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445680/Kids_Mode_Finding_Nemo.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids Mode comes with a bunch of Disney and Pixar themes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TzEASO"&gt;Once Kids Mode is enabled, there are also options to customize the themes, colors, and new tab background. Microsoft has even teamed up with Disney and Pixar to offer special themes like &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/em&gt;, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q8mAl"&gt;Microsoft sees this as a “game-changer for parents,” and the simplicity and ease of use is certainly refreshing to see. “When we looked at the other content filtering and control offerings on the market today, we consistently found that most of them require a very lengthy sign-up process or a subscription, and generally don’t offer anything lightweight or catered for kids,” says Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfyRST"&gt;Kids Mode will be available in Microsoft Edge today for both Windows and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz finally allows a full look at the 2022 EQS luxury electric sedan </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/975JN1YOkH6o33560Kz4R_J3DeA=/194x0:4768x3049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131171/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_071.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;And it’s two-tone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="V3uiyU"&gt;Mercedes-Benz finally pulled the camouflage off its 2022 EQS electric sedan, and the two-tone paint job is sure to raise some interesting questions. The German automaker is still keeping several key details under wraps, such as the pricing, but as we said earlier, the EQS is a bold break from the current crop of minimalist electric vehicles with its big battery, huge infotainment screen, and richly appointed interior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bycpFz"&gt;When it arrives at dealerships in the fall of 2021, the EQS will be the first long-range EV from Mercedes available to buy in the US, beating out the EQC compact SUV, which has been delayed indefinitely. As such, it will be the first of nine other EVs that &lt;a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Plans-for-more-than-ten-different-all-electric-vehicles-by-2022-All-systems-are-go.xhtml?oid=29779739"&gt;the automaker plans&lt;/a&gt; to release by 2022. And as a close relative of the segment-defining S-Class, there’s a lot riding on the EQS and the company’s high-stakes effort to define the luxury EV market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQkDGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the EQS will be the first long-range EV from Mercedes available to buy in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBMbaW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; got the chance to drive the EQS last week&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ve already seen much of what Mercedes is announcing today up close. That includes the automatic front and rear doors, the 56-inch Hyperscreen with the company’s MBUX infotainment system, the augmented reality heads-up display, and the various other luxury vehicle accruements that felt both necessary and superfluous in equal parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g_z-H06OhNXZ6AVVK8BDAGSQgg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446004/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_078.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzPq51gaOiRBRbL4V3fAjDv883w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446003/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_077.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jJhK05gDlvi6984d36lupqfarCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446001/2020_11_21_Image_20C0714_072.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5TMSF"&gt;This is our first look at some of the exterior details of the EQS, as Mercedes had previously kept the front and rear section under wraps. Gone is the all-digital front end we saw with the Vision EQS concept car, replaced with a “black radiator grille” with a “three-dimensional star pattern” that is also found in Mercedes’ AMG lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agl6B3"&gt;The headlights are connected by a light bar, a design that is becoming popular among EVs across different brands. There’s no hood ornament like you would find with the S-Class, but the EQS did keep the air vents on either side of the grille, eschewing the flat, vent-less face of the Tesla Model 3 and other EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y33WQn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The two-tone paint scheme in the images provided by Mercedes is certainly a choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TaYld5"&gt;The two-tone paint scheme in the images provided by Mercedes is certainly a choice, and it may prove divisive depending on your opinion about dueling exterior colors. It’s not completely out of the blue, though: Mercedes does offer &lt;a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/vehicles/passenger-cars/mercedes-maybach/the-exterior-design-of-the-new-mercedes-maybach-s-class/"&gt;a two-tone finish on its Maybach S-Class&lt;/a&gt;. And there is something to be said for an attempt to think outside of the monochromatic box. That said, this won’t be the only finish offered and a quick trip to Mercedes’ online configurator is sure to reveal other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6W5Mqw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10448030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0R6Tw5"&gt;The EQS will be available in two trim levels to start out: the rear-wheel drive EQS 450+ and dual-motor, all-wheel drive 580 4MATIC. Frustratingly, Mercedes did not reveal pricing information for either variant, though we should expect both to sell for over six figures. (By way of comparison, the base model of the S-Class is priced at $110,000.) Both models will come with a 107.8kWh battery pack, though Mercedes has said it also plans to sell a version with a smaller, 90kWh battery as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nYsqP"&gt;Built on a brand-new electric vehicle architecture for Mercedes, the EQS is expected to get 770 kilometers of range — or 478 miles — based on the European WLTP cycle. That number will most likely drop when it’s eventually tested by the US EPA, though it could still beat out the longest range Tesla Model S. Regardless, it’s plenty of range for daily driving or even medium to longer trips and will certainly set the standard for the luxury EV market.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1EYHy"&gt;Of course, EVs still represent a small fraction of overall car sales, and luxury vehicles alone won’t spur the mass adoption that policymakers say we’ll need to begin transitioning away from polluting gas-powered cars. But with the right combination of power, range, and affordability, Mercedes and other automakers will have their work cut out for them as we move closer to an all-electric future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FubjxT"&gt;Related: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches $200 million fund for climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izf-vlTMXN2F6fe7wIXn_FWU7_o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130995/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z0P1J5"&gt;Apple has created a $200 million fund to invest in forestry projects to help remove carbon from the atmosphere while also generating financial returns for its investors, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-and-partners-launch-first-ever-200-million-restore-fund%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22385552%2Fapple-200-million-fund-climate-change-environment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Restore Fund will invest in forest properties that are managed to increase carbon removal and produce timber. The goal is to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoAfi6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332461/apple-carbon-neutral-2030-climate-change"&gt;Apple said last year&lt;/a&gt; it wants to eliminate its contributions to climate change and become carbon neutral by 2030. The company says it will directly eliminate 75 percent of emissions from its supply chain and products by 2030, and the Restore Fund will help address the other 25 percent of its emissions. Apple’s partners in the Restore Fund include the nonprofit Conservation International and the Goldman Sachs group which will manage the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1o3BP"&gt;“Through creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real, and measurable carbon impacts, we aim to drive broader change in the future — encouraging investment in carbon removal around the globe,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, said in a statement. “Our hope is that others share our goals and contribute their resources to support and protect critical ecosystems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vVCah"&gt;Apple said it will work with organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and Verra to help determine the projects in which it will invest. The company didn’t say what the fund’s target returns would be but said it would “unlock the potential of this natural solutions by scaling it in a way that makes it attractive to businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bkv7Ds"&gt;There’s some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;controversy around the strategy of using forests&lt;/a&gt; as a way of offsetting greenhouse emissions. The World Economic Forum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;launched an initiative last year&lt;/a&gt; to plant a trillion trees to cut emissions. But its effort cited a study that &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6494/eabc8905"&gt;greatly overestimated&lt;/a&gt; the impact such an effort would have on the environment, researchers later found. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hit a key climate goal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RH5rfLfFusvDjQUxGlsrmtXhMv0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130975/1232289899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UwtAkk"&gt;Facebook announced today that it exceeded&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one of its biggest environmental goals: it managed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 94 percent in 2020. It had previously pledged to cut planet-heating emissions by 75 percent. The company said that it had also achieved its goal of “net zero emissions” — not putting any more emissions into the atmosphere than it can take out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzcRqm"&gt;Facebook also announced that it had achieved another goal: it now purchases enough renewable energy to cover 100 percent of its global operations, which includes its offices and data centers. But that doesn’t mean that all of its operations are actually powered by renewables like solar and wind energy — at least not yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TwVE1E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy to cover 100 percent of its global operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IT7sOt"&gt;Renewable energy is on the rise, but most electricity grids still rely on fossil fuels. When companies can’t purchase enough renewable energy from utilities because there isn’t enough supply, they buy renewable energy certificates that signal that the company invested in renewable energy projects somewhere. Those projects can be located anywhere, and certificates have been sold for so cheap that critics say they &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/what-it-really-means-when-google-and-apple-say-they-run-on-100-renewable-energy-f6d1719fd865"&gt;don’t really lead to more renewable energy generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook also relies on renewable energy certificates, but it focuses on signing long-term contracts to support the construction of new solar and wind developments in the same places where it operates. It’s invested in 63 new renewable energy projects located on the same electrical grids as its data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbV9Um"&gt;Its next target is to reach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437208/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-greenhouse-gas-pledge"&gt;net zero emissions by 2030&lt;/a&gt; for its entire supply chain and other indirect emissions that come from things like employee travel and commuting. To hit that goal, Facebook says that it developed environmental standards for its suppliers. It also plans to rely more heavily on emerging technologies that draw carbon dioxide out of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6gVQ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Misinformation about climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UN4xcA"&gt;Facebook has recently also tried to limit misinformation about climate change on its platform. Last year, it launched a “Climate Science Information Center” in some countries. In the UK this year, it started adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288439/facebook-label-climate-change-posts-misinformation"&gt;label&lt;/a&gt; to some posts about climate change that redirect people to its information center. It all comes on the heels of criticism from activists and policymakers over how misinformation about climate change festered on the site, including one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368136/facebook-climate-change-fact-check-senators-warren"&gt;high-profile case&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook reversing a “false” rating that its fact-checkers gave to an op-ed based on inaccurate information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEpq3G"&gt;“We know the next 10 years will be the defining time for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and that we have a role to play in this effort — both as a platform that connects people to information and as a global company that supports climate action,” Facebook’s director of renewable energy, Urvi Parekh, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/renewable-energy/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHXVb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus adds new workouts designed specifically for pregnant, beginner, and older users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0c5dFFELiunEvEezdXUmUamDso=/59x0:1925x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130908/Apple_iphone12_apple_fitness_plus_workout_for_pregnancy_and_older_adults_and_beginners_041521.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1XnN9E"&gt;Apple is adding a variety of new workouts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;its $9.99-per-month Fitness Plus service&lt;/a&gt;, including programs designed specifically for beginners and workouts tailored for both pregnant and elderly users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mPJK6"&gt;“With more options for getting started, and staying active and healthy during pregnancy as well as at any age or fitness level, we hope even more people will be inspired to keep moving with our amazing team of passionate trainers,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CcRSMS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Fitness Plus review: easy mode","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="til5wu"&gt;The new “Workouts for Pregnancy” program consists of 10 workouts across Apple’s strength, core, and mindful cooldown categories. Each workout is about 10 minutes long and designed specifically for pregnant users, with variations and suggestions for modifying the exercises as a pregnancy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJglp0"&gt;“Workouts for Older Adults,” as the name implies, is a series of eight workouts meant for elderly users. The workouts are generally designed to use either light dumbbells or the user’s bodyweight and feature modifications to use chairs or walls to assist as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZP5AD"&gt;And for beginners who are new to working out (or starting again after a long break), Apple is adding new low-impact yoga, HIIT, and strength classes to help ease newcomers into fitness with basic exercises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOjr4S"&gt;Lastly, Apple Fitness Plus is also adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;new “Time to Walk” episode&lt;/a&gt;: an Earth Day-themed program featuring Jane Fonda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fT0ut9"&gt;The newly added Workouts for Pregnancy, Workouts for Older Adults, and Workouts for Beginners, as well as the new Jane Fonda Time to Walk episode, will be added to Apple Fitness Plus on Monday, April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHLW1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZiuLwt"&gt;Peloton debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a much-desired feature: GymKit support. But now, the company’s pulling back some of that functionality. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that GymKit no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes and instead will “only be available in cycling classes for now.” The spokesperson also said: “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines within Apple’s terms of service,” seemingly suggesting bootcamp workouts didn’t fall under those terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYdBuC"&gt;This change is a disruptive one for users who might have purchased the Bike Plus specifically for its GymKit support. It’s the first piece of hardware from the connected fitness company to support GymKit, and the direct Apple Watch integration makes tracking workouts easy, especially during Bike Bootcamp, which fuses cycling and strength exercises. Now, users will have to find a way to track these trickier workouts, like starting a cycling workout, ending it, switching to a strength-training workout, ending it, and so on. People can also try a cross-training workout, but that might not capture the entirety of the workout, either. When paired with the Apple Watch, the Bike Plus also displays users’ heart rates on the screen. This is also now gone from bootcamp classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfguh6"&gt;This is the reality Peloton users will have to deal with for the time being, at least until Apple starts supporting the bootcamp classes in its terms or Peloton figures something out on its end. I have a Bike Plus at home and use it with an Apple Watch, and I noticed the change immediately. It was upsetting! My output always seemed unusually high during bootcamp workouts, so it’s possible they weren’t accurate, but seeing my heart rate on the screen and having my workout automatically tracked was nice. I’m sad to see this functionality go, but I hope it might return in the future, albeit it with more accurate metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook Spin 513 with a Snapdragon 7c processor starts at $480</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/awz9VSnUVYP0v3XYI2qj0mq-zaI=/0x313:3000x2313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130817/Acer_Chromebook_Spin_513_CP513_1H_L__High_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dsskNS"&gt;We already knew Acer was working on the first two Chrome OS devices powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c chips. And today, the company has released two product listings for its Chromebook Spin 513, but you can’t buy this laptop just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wv9jHs"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-513-starts-at-479-with-snapdragon-7c/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;AboutChromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromebook Spin 513 with the Snapdragon 7c processor has two configuration listings that have appeared on Acer’s website, with a starting price of $479.99. Acer announced in October that the Chromebook Spin would start at $399.99. Additionally, both laptops also do not show 4G LTE for connectivity, which is something that was noted to be a configuration option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtiAuV"&gt;The key difference between the two is the RAM configuration, which is only a $20 price difference. Although the product listing for both Chromebooks include a “Buy Now” button, it is still not available for purchase yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5uyDQ"&gt;The Snapdragon 7c is an entry-level mobile processor that’s built on an 8nm process. Although it is one of the weaker laptop CPUs, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997402/qualcomm-arm-midrange-windows-laptop-processors-8c-7c-8cx-snapdragon"&gt;claims the biggest benefit&lt;/a&gt; for devices powered by this processor is a longer battery life; Acer claims its Chromebook devices powered by the Snapdragon 7c will offer a 14-hour battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
