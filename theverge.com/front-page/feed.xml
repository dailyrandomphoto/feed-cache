    <title>Comcast now sells Xfinity Flex users internet cable TV from YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrwiM_klb8ozay2ZHEgUg-pZzBU=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251941/Web_Publishing_XfinityFlex_YouTubeTVLaunch_16x9_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NRDjUc"&gt;Comcast is introducing YouTube TV to its Xfinity Flex devices, providing users another avenue for opting out of traditional cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MgqhS"&gt;YouTube was &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fxfinity-flex-overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826856%2Fcomcast-xfinity-flex-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previously supported&lt;/a&gt; on Comcast’s Flex boxes, but the addition of YouTube TV gives users the ability to get some 85-plus live television channels for $65 per month. It’s not the first live TV streaming service to arrive on the platform — Sling and Hulu with Live TV were already supported. But it does diversify the streaming options for people who don’t want to pay Comcast for cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpmBa5"&gt;Colin Petrie-Norris, senior vice president of consumer entertainment at Xfinity, said &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/youtube-tv-launches-on-xfinity-flex"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the addition of YouTube TV “is another example of how we surround our broadband service with value, giving our customers access to all their preferred content and subscriptions on one device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWItlR"&gt;It’s a curious move from a cable provider, but it also makes sense if Comcast wants to stay competitive against other over-the-top boxes like Roku, Fire TV Stick, or Chromecast — all of which support YouTube TV. Currently, Comcast provides the boxes to its Xfinity Internet customers at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fxfinity-flex-overview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826856%2Fcomcast-xfinity-flex-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;no additional cost&lt;/a&gt;, but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; need people to use them. And that means supporting popular apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k57vG9"&gt;YouTube TV is available to Flex users beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt8PPE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock will stream NBCUniversal movies as soon as 45 days after theatrical release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WrC5IlId7eGHGpUEmnuH9U2ivog=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251901/acastro_200714_1777_peacock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “majority” of films from Universal Filmed Entertainment Group will be available exclusively on Peacock.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TcTGec"&gt;NBCUniversal committed to adding the “majority” of films from Universal Pictures, Focus Features, Illumination, and DreamWorks Animation Films to its Peacock streaming service as soon as 45 days after they hit theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/interactive/2929fed4187b40648b79a9839e70e91fproduct169208/index.html#/brand/ddfffeac-5bfe-497f-9bfb-d359535d0079/press-releases/4149d711-2be9-4007-afe0-e35210fb8aee"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. The new strategy kicks off with its 2022 slate of films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJB6I6"&gt;This model means that movies including &lt;em&gt;The 355&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Halloween Ends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey: A New Era&lt;/em&gt; will be available on Peacock soon after they debut in theaters. However, some of the company’s bigger 2022 movies, including &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World: Dominion&lt;/em&gt; and Christopher Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Oppenheimer&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t expected to be part of this arrangement, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/universal-movie-theater-theatrical-window-1235130063/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t41J9g"&gt;Entertainment companies have been experimenting with release strategies due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to help drive interest in their streaming services. WarnerMedia, for example, committed to releasing its entire 2021 slate of films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, though will return to theatrical exclusivity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;for its 2022 film releases&lt;/a&gt;. Disney made a handful of movies available on Disney Plus day-and-date with theaters for a fee as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;Premier Access program&lt;/a&gt;, though shifted to theatrical exclusivity for many of its 2021 films released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22668326/disney-movies-exclusive-theatrical-streaming-black-widow-eternals-johansson"&gt;in the year&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Build-A-Bear’s new Matrix Bear probably doesn’t know kung fu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0yA6eOuChkndm3KQt3Pgt_JNDs=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251820/matrixbear.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Enter the Bear-trix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5P2SqV"&gt;Build-A-Bear has announced its latest movie tie-in: an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Fonline-exclusive-matrix-bear-with-costume%2F329693_29694.html%3Fcgid%3Dshop-by-license-matrix&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826150%2Fbuild-a-bear-matrix-bear-neo-outfit-teddy-stuffed-animal-toy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;absolutely incredible-looking &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-themed bear&lt;/a&gt; (officially called “Matrix Bear”) just in time for the release of the upcoming fourth film in the absolutely-not-for-children film series, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKPz8X"&gt;Matrix Bear is unique among Build-A-Bear bears, with green and black fur patterned after the iconic “digital rain” effect from the films. It also features &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;logo on one of its feet, with an optional “hacker costume” outfit patterned after Neo’s garb from the films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cF39vR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Neo still knows kung fu in the latest trailer for The Matrix Resurrections","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820636/the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-neo-trinity-keanu-reeves-deja-vu-loop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mtq2qu"&gt;
&lt;p id="tO8oRc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXT. The Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxcrtt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus&lt;/strong&gt;: Let me tell you why you’re here, at the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop. You’re here because you know something. What you know you can’t explain, but you feel it. You’ve felt it your entire life, that there’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is, but it’s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I’m talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FlSzW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo&lt;/strong&gt;: The Bear-trix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrO6Gp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you want to know what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUMc1o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmIvPH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Neo and Morpheus are both teddy bears in this scene)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2z6M3f"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aE3iV186EdAGNpmVyxLY54H7tCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076879/29693x.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VqkoP6"&gt;The new Matrix Bear is part of Build a Bear’s “The Bear Cave” lineup of bears and accessories intended for adult fans of stuffed animals, rather than the brand’s usual, more child-friendly products. That said, there is still some &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; cognitive dissonance in seeing a leather duster-clad stuffed animal decked out as Neo from the violent, R-rated films with a Bear-A-Bear workshop heart logo on its paw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Vn773"&gt;Matrix Bear isn’t cheap, either: the bear itself costs $29 on its own, while the &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; costume (which includes the coat and sunglasses outfit ) is an additional $22 on top, for a total of $51 for the full set. The Matrix Bear is also an online exclusive, so you won’t be able to go into an actual Build-A-Bear workshop and stuff your own Neo-lookalike teddy at your nearest suburban mall (which is probably for the best, all things considered).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Csqdh"&gt;The Neo-style bear is the only &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-themed outfit that Build-A-Bear offers, which is bad news for anyone hoping to round out their collection with Trinity or Morpheus bears. Although, technically, there’s nothing stopping you (other than financial responsibility and common sense, that is) from getting a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buildabear.com%2Ftimeless-teddy-business-suit-gift-set%2F26518_27532_20666.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22826150%2Fbuild-a-bear-matrix-bear-neo-outfit-teddy-stuffed-animal-toy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;few dozen extra bears in a bunch of matching suits&lt;/a&gt; to recreate the Neo / Agent Smith clone fight from &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; in stop-motion with an army of stuffed animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1Pxrt8"&gt;
&lt;p id="3KlRI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INT. Neo and Morpheus (still talking teddy bears) continue their conversation by the FLUFF ME STATION inside the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5FhLf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Bear-trix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to school... when you go to the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop... when you pay for your new fuzzy friend at the Westchester Mall Build-A-Bear Workshop. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpVdZJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neo&lt;/strong&gt;: What truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJFSoF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morpheus: &lt;/strong&gt;That you are a bear, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into being a furry ball of fluff. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ9XbI"&gt;END SCENE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jUd5Hg"&gt;
&lt;p id="1TtiHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbg0Er"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teL2Mz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv5S7x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft quietly told Apple it was willing to turn big Xbox-exclusive games into iPhone apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i9cVe1ppyQ6-8z8vFKiO3cyOTuA=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251798/xcloud.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Private emails show Microsoft wheeling and dealing to get into the App Store&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="E3Oank"&gt;Remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;when Apple pretended like&lt;/a&gt; it would let cloud gaming services like Microsoft xCloud and Google Stadia into the App Store, while effectively tearing their business models to shreds? Know how Microsoft replied that forcing gamers to download hundreds of individual apps to play a catalog of cloud games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;would be a bad experience&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDCMx8"&gt;In reality, Microsoft was willing to play along with many of Apple’s demands — and it even offered to bring triple-A, Xbox-exclusive games to iPhone to help sweeten the deal. That’s according to a new set of private emails that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; unearthed in the aftermath of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfYI2X"&gt;These games would have run on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) platform, streaming from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade"&gt;remote server farms filled with Xbox One and Xbox Series X processors&lt;/a&gt; instead of relying on the local processing power of your phone. If the deal had been made, you could have theoretically bought a copy of a game like &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in Apple’s App Store itself and launched it like any other app — instead of having to pay $14.99 a month for an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription with a set catalog of games and then needing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;use Microsoft’s web-based App Store workaround&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCr70L"&gt;But primarily, Microsoft was negotiating to bring its Netflix-esque catalog of xCloud games to the App Store, at a time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;when Apple had gotten &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; touchy&lt;/a&gt; about cloud gaming in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hi5NMy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s what Apple’s new rules about cloud gaming actually mean","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"},{"title":"Microsoft snubs Apple’s olive branch to cloud gaming: ‘a bad experience for customers’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5QKg9g"&gt;The emails, between Microsoft Xbox head of business development Lori Wright and several key members of Apple’s App Store teams, show that Microsoft &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; start with a wide array of concerns about stuffing an entire service worth of Xbox games into individual App Store apps as of February 2020. Wright mentioned the “Complexity &amp;amp; management of creating hundreds to thousands of apps,” how they’d have to update every one of those apps to fix any bugs, and how all those app icons could lead to cluttered iOS homescreens, among other worries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="72d3BC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHJwJS"&gt;“We believe that the issues described here will create frustration and confusion for customers, resulting in a sub-par experience on Apple devices relative to the equivalent experience on all other platforms,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbVhIc"&gt;But by March of last year, Microsoft was proposing that it could, actually, create those hundreds or thousands of individual apps to submit to the App Store — as long as it could make those apps a bit more like shortcuts, instead of stuffing the whole cloud gaming streaming stack into each one. She argued that’s similar to how watchOS apps already worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDVQ1w"&gt;“If we have a single streaming tech app, it will be around 150 MB, but the other apps will only be roughly 30 MB and will not need to be updated when the streaming tech is updated. This will be a better experience for users,” Wright wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6eFWOk24KmQ465a08tnAdDOkI7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076481/lori_wright_xcloud_microsoft_email_apple_streaming_stack.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wright explains that Microsoft is “close to finding a solve” to bring Xbox games to iOS as App Store apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enNv0G"&gt;That’s also when Wright pulled out the idea of bringing exclusive triple-A Xbox games to iOS, arguing that they, too, would need “the streaming tech package as a separate app to deliver the right experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibh3oU"&gt;“This would be an incredibly exciting opportunity for iOS users to get access to these exclusive AAA titles in addition to the Game Pass games,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LE6Cm8"&gt;Obviously, none of this happened. Microsoft rejected Apple’s new App Store guidelines in September 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;announced the web workaround version of xCloud&lt;/a&gt; a month later. It arrived this April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRGtCU"&gt;Where did negotiations break down? Microsoft now tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple was actually the one that rejected &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; proposals — because Apple insisted on forcing each and every game to include the full streaming stack and wouldn’t agree to anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ANTUQu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Forcing each game to include our streaming tech stack proved to be unrealistic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amS8gi"&gt;“Our proposal for bringing games through individual apps was designed to comply with App Store policies. It was denied by Apple based on our request that there be a single streaming tech app to support the individual game apps, as the initial email states. Forcing each game to include our streaming tech stack proved to be unrealistic from a support and engineering perspective and would create an incredibly negative experience for customers,” reads a statement from Xbox Cloud Gaming CVP Kareem Choudhry to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83oXGi"&gt;Late last April, Apple’s App Store games manager Mark Grimm suggested that might not be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason the companies didn’t reach an understanding — it might have something to do with money as well. He told colleagues that Microsoft was actually now entertaining the idea of including the streaming code in individual Xbox games on the App Store. “[Wright] was far more positive and was trying to pressure her engineering team into finding a way to put the entire streaming stack into each binary,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzFK5cIx12V37mIWIzLmnC8V70k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076821/apple_grimm_email.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grimm goes on to suggest that Apple’s agreed role in negotiations was to “take the IAP problem back and figure something out,” but it sounds like that didn’t happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TXgaGZ"&gt;But there was also a concern that Microsoft didn’t want to put in-app purchases into each game: “Their proposal for IAPs is still that they process all IAPs on their existing system and settle up with us (either in real-time or monthly),” wrote Grimm, stating the opinion that Apple should let Microsoft’s games bypass IAP. “They’re not trying to circumvent &lt;em&gt;paying us&lt;/em&gt;, they’re trying to circumvent a large amount of redundant API work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="F2jdvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re not trying to circumvent &lt;em&gt;paying us”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SLzwTA"&gt;And Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that money was indeed involved. “Unfortunately, Microsoft proposed a version of xCloud that was not compliant with our App Store Review Guidelines, specifically the requirement to use in-app purchase to unlock additional features or functionality within an app,” reads a statement via Apple spokesperson Adam Dema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr8Qc5"&gt;Microsoft’s Choudhry denies that IAP came into the final decision. “The reasons for rejection were unrelated to in-app purchase capabilities; we currently provide Xbox Cloud Gaming through a singular Xbox Game Pass app in the Google Play Store without IAP enabled, for example, and we would do the same through the App Store if allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZQh0w"&gt;Here’s Choudhry’s general statement on the entire matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EMeJSY"&gt;We explored many options to bring Cloud Gaming via Xbox Game Pass to Apple devices, always in ways that led with the customer experience first, which we believed was best through a singular app. Apple’s Store policies would have forced us to launch each game as an individual app—while we never favored that approach, we explored it as a possibility in the spirit of finding any solution to bring Cloud Gaming to iOS customers. However between that email in March 2020 and our statement to The Verge in September 2020, Apple rejected our proposals and we were left without the ability to release a cohesive Xbox Game Pass offering through the App Store. We shifted our engineering priorities and have now moved to a browser-based solution making Xbox Cloud Gaming available to iOS customers through web browsers, and will continue to look for viable resolutions that allow us into the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="auPX2d"&gt;As for the possibility of bringing triple-A Xbox exclusives to the iPhone and iPad as individual games, he confirms: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3fC3gA"&gt;“In addition to Xbox Game Pass, we were also open to bringing select individual games to iOS as we do today with titles like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy pulls TCL Google TVs amid complaints of slow, buggy software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/speHBcienQnWeFQXFBYRIf-kme4=/20x0:2168x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251693/327063D4_692F_4275_A45A_6A2026E0BFEF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VaLJJm"&gt;Back in late summer, TCL announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;upgraded version of its high-end 6-Series TV&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from some technical improvements — the newer set fully supports HDMI 2.1 and 4K gaming at 120Hz — the biggest change had to do with software, with the latest 6-Series running Google TV instead of the Roku OS that has shipped on many of TCL’s most popular sets in the United States. The company has already released TVs powered by Android TV internationally and on a few budget models in North America, but the 2021 6-Series was meant to be a combined showcase for TCL hardware and Google software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkl6Du"&gt;So far, it’s not working out that way, and things aren’t going quite as well as TCL might’ve hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqmHWT"&gt;Some early buyers of the 6-Series with Google TV (model R646) have complained about what they describe as a buggy, sluggish user interface. I myself have been reviewing a 65-inch model over the past couple weeks, and while the Google TV home screen seems to work relatively well, it didn’t take long for me to notice some general slowness when pulling up and going through the settings menu. There can also be a lag before the TV reacts to remote control commands. My roommates have observed crashing apps and a few instances where the TV itself froze and became unresponsive. Some online reviews cite more annoying problems that require unplugging the TV altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAcBz9"&gt;Similar early criticisms have also been leveled at the 5-Series with Google TV; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1RPvpz5H0U4"&gt;Caleb at &lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found his review unit to be on the slow side and ran into several bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZeQ5novFx3uBWAhquLlHq4PFo-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076791/E4A32016_080D_41C0_8688_6F461E5E3C4E.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tcltvs/comments/r9yiux/will_the_google_tv_os_get_faster_on_the_s546_new/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; about the 5-Series with Google TV is equally applicable to the 6-Series.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ulo5vT"&gt;TCL has already rolled out several software updates meant to improve performance and stability. “Our priority is to deliver an optimized user experience with Google TV and have a cadence of planned software updates for TCL devices,” TCL spokesperson Rachelle Parks told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in late November. Some of those updates do seem to have made a positive difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5nH2w"&gt;But as of this week, Best Buy — the exclusive US retailer of the TCL Google TVs — has abruptly removed both models from its store listings. &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/home-theater/6-series/55-class-6-series-4k-qled-hdr-smart-google-tv-55r646"&gt;TCL’s own website&lt;/a&gt; has a link to Best Buy that no longer works. Prior to the removal, the 65-inch 6-Series I’m testing &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Freviews%2Ftcl-65-class-6-series-mini-led-qled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv%2F6470277&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had an average review rating of 3.5 stars&lt;/a&gt;. Many reviews praise the panel and Mini LED picture quality but go on to list issues encountered with the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq3o3k"&gt;While TCL is familiar with Android TV, the Google TV software experience is new territory for the company, and clearly, it’s having a rough go at this early stage. I hope a lot of the performance issues can be ironed out with more updates; this really is a fantastic TV, with terrific peak brightness and excellent contrast thanks to that Mini LED backlighting. But it’s not where it needs to be right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX4StJ"&gt;In fact, I’ve already gone ahead and plugged an Apple TV 4K into one of the HDMI ports just to avoid the sluggishness and jank. Streaming devices are a great way to speed up budget TVs, but they shouldn’t be a necessary bandaid for a TV with an MSRP of over $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S60Fdn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to both TCL and Best Buy for more details. This could be a supply shortage situation (though it’d be odd for the pages to completely vanish in that case), or maybe TCL is taking a beat to assess next steps for its new Google TVs to turn around their buggy early reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DN-viq88iRgLXKnBD9TUqV9LjhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251636/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyTsr3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the fact that there was no requirement for a time period, the agreement clearly stated "in a prominent and visible location on the People site".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f6ksV6"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also ignored changes to the settlement requested by the NLRB. Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788245/cher-scarlett-apple-nlrb-settlement-leaves-company-appletoo-pay-equity"&gt;left the company in November&lt;/a&gt;, after filing the complaint that accused the company of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” While at the company, she worked to let employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;discuss and gather data about pay equity&lt;/a&gt; and was part of #AppleToo, a campaign about the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;failure to deal with harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has reportedly closed an Apple Store in Texas due to a COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GlyHyyF7X96_IbKY3YI_o7wC6Yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251538/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me4IJw"&gt;Apple closed one of its Southlake, Texas retail stores Wednesday after many staff members contracted COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;em&gt;’ &lt;/em&gt;Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. A manager told employees Wednesday that 22 staffers “have shared that they’re positive for COVID-19,” NBC News reported, and four of the store’s 151 employees reported positive cases right after Black Friday. The store will be closed through Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnEhom"&gt;NBC News’ report highlights a few worrying trends about the Southlake location. One employee said they had previously raised concerns about being unable to keep social distancing. He and another employee said the store was packed “shoulder to shoulder” on Black Friday. And a manager at the Southlake store apparently had asked employees to come even if they had called in sick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ftJJuM"&gt;NBC spoke with four current and former employees at the Southlake store who said they’ve received calls from their manager encouraging them to come to work, even when they called out sick. In two of these cases, the employee had taken the Covid-19 survey and the results said not to come in. The manager did not respond to requests for comment from NBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N5atlM"&gt;Apple’s official policy requires retail staffers to wear masks and to take a COVID-19 survey before they go to work. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;must also be tested for COVID-19 frequently&lt;/a&gt;: unvaccinated workers must be tested twice per week and vaccinated workers tested once per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrpsZe"&gt;The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Schiffer reported this month for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of Apple’s frontline workers find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;working conditions to be untenable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDHSeq"&gt;Most of Apple’s corporate employees will return to the offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;in a hybrid work pilot&lt;/a&gt; beginning February 1st. The company originally announced its hybrid work plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; with the intent to return in September, but that was delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;to January&lt;/a&gt; and then to February. Facebook parent company Meta has also recently updated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1469042247450513410"&gt;its return to work policies&lt;/a&gt;. Offices will fully reopen on January 31st, but staff will be able to defer coming back by three to five months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford stops taking reservations for the F-150 Lightning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Noo_2E1bgoyZ8BCx9P9PA2hrIvc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251187/akrales_20210526_4595_0085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIRLIa"&gt;Ford has &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;stopped taking reservations&lt;/a&gt; for the all-electric F-150 Lightning as it prepares to start making and shipping the new pickup truck in the first half of 2022. The company says it has collected 200,000 refundable $100 deposits for the Lightning since it debuted in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXPMPy"&gt;That means that anyone not already in line may have to wait a while to buy Ford’s first mass-market electric pickup truck off a dealer lot (or order one from the company’s website). Ford hasn’t said how many it plans to build in 2022, but &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that the automaker is looking to build as many as 80,000 in 2023. The company has publicly said it wants to build that many in 2024 after originally targeting just 40,000 annually and has been hiring new workers to handle the demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JKLJJT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Lightning starts at $40,000&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IpjInH"&gt;The F-150 Lightning starts at $40,000 but can more than double depending on which version people buy. That base model is supposed to offer around 230 miles of range and has a more bare-bones interior, including a 12-inch landscape touchscreen display that runs Sync 4. Higher trims will come with the same 15.5-inch vertical touchscreen from the Mustang Mach-E, and there’s an extended range battery option that can push the range to around 300 miles. Towing capacity ranges between 7,700 and 10,000 pounds, depending on the configuration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Ez4Q90"&gt;As long as they start shipping on time, Ford will join Rivian and GMC as the only automakers with an electric pickup truck on the market.

    <title>Life360 makes millions selling location data, and it’s about to buy Tile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Life360’s marketing image of acquiring Tile is also a reminder of how much data it owns now | Image: Life360&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7UuBs"&gt;Life360, the company that bills its product as a “family safety service,” has been selling location data on its 31 million customers — including kids — since 2016, &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/12/06/the-popular-family-safety-app-life360-is-selling-precise-location-data-on-its-tens-of-millions-of-user"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebad8L"&gt;Former employees from data broker companies told &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;that Life360 is “one of the largest sources of data” for what has become a $12 billion phone location tracking industry. In November, the company announced it’s reached a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22797559/tile-bluetooth-tracker-location-gps-acquisition-life360"&gt;acquire&lt;/a&gt; the popular item tracking company Tile for $205 million and said it plans to pursue a dual public listing in the US (it’s currently listed on the Australian Securities Exchange) next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LhNA7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;there are currently no plans to sell Tile’s data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5G3PH0"&gt;“Our philosophy has been first ... be open with our users with what we are doing,” Hulls said, “and give them control.” The Life360 app defaults to consenting to sell user data and would need users to opt out within the app settings to prevent sharing of their personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AprTLJ"&gt;While announcing the acquisition, which will maintain Tile as an independent entity led by current CEO CJ Prober, Hulls described plans for the companies to connect Tile accounts to the Life360 app. During our conversation, he said that the APIs could allow customers to combine all family members (including pets, via another recent acquisition, Jiobit) and their stuff in one interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="lgeq5C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today begins a new chapter in Life360’s history.  I’m excited to announce Life360 is acquiring &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTileApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@thetileapp&lt;/a&gt;. This marks an incredible moment in our vision of being the world’s leading platform for safety and location services. Welcome to the team Tile! &lt;a href="https://t.co/q3uDFJiiGS"&gt;https://t.co/q3uDFJiiGS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Hulls (@ChrisHulls) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisHulls/status/1462938228512624640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8Nlxa"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, Life360 generated almost $700,000 from selling location data in 2016. This would later become a more integral revenue stream for the company. In a conversation with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, CEO Chris Hulls confirmed it brought in about $16 million in 2020, even as the company reported an overall &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21109082-life360-2020-financial-records#document/p39/a2066528"&gt;loss of $16.3 million last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZH5vaQ"&gt;A Tile representative responded to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about how the deal potentially affects data from its Bluetooth (and, eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022"&gt;ultra wideband&lt;/a&gt;) trackers: “Tile does not sell/monetize personal data and we have Life360’s full support and commitment to continue that.” Hulls told T&lt;em&gt;he Markup&lt;/em&gt; there are currently no plans to sell Tile’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0jQFq"&gt;Companies in the location data industry like Cuebiq, X-Mode, SafeGraph, and Allstate’s Arity all pay for access to Life360’s customer tracking. A former Cuebiq employee quoted in the report “joked” that their former employer would not be able to operate its marketing campaign without Life360 data. A former X-Mode employee said Life360 had the “most valuable offerings due to the sheer volume and precision” compared to other sources of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioyE8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; asked Hulls about the claim that his company is the largest hub for the phone location tracking industry; he responded with the following message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZYB6EJ"&gt;We have no means to confirm or deny the accuracy of that statement. However, the vast majority of mobile applications - including some which are many times larger than Life360 - collect, use, and share data in various ways. Our level of participation in the ecosystem is likely commensurate with the size of our user base. As &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; itself has reported, there are almost two billion devices that are connected to the mobile phone location data market. Based on this data, at maximum, with approximately 30 million active users, we account for a very small portion of the overall market. Similarly, from a revenue perspective, we are almost certainly one of the smaller companies involved in the broader industry as the market is estimated to be over $10 billion and we generate approximately $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cbegxe"&gt; Hulls also told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; that Life360 does not share information with government entities — but once the data is purchased, “We cannot comment on the practices of another company or what that company does with data it receives from other sources.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTpnHw"&gt;Hulls continued in the email response to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; saying Life360 prohibits tracing back information to individual customers in its contracts with data purchasers. Hulls says he is also not aware of any instance where a customer was re-identified, stating Life360 follows privacy practices that are “industry best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KVVQCZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Data brokers] depend on people not understanding where things are coming from, where they’re going, where they’re actually getting their data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ZKMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; also spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/bennett-cyphers"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff technologist Bennett Cyphers&lt;/a&gt;, who pointed out that very few apps disclose what companies they’re actually sharing data with because they’re not legally required to do so. It’s not only that the apps aren’t telling users where their data is going, and the companies that pass the data on refuse to tell their customers how it was obtained. As he put it, “Especially the ones [data brokers] that deal in location data, they consider the apps that they collect data from to be trade secrets, and they won’t reveal that to anyone, in response to anything.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1zlvq"&gt;Based on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests on situations where the government has obtained location data from a broker, in every case the EFF has seen, the government has no idea where the data is coming from. “Secrecy is these companies bread and butter, they cannot exist out in the sunlight. They depend on people not understanding where things are coming from, where they’re going, where they’re actually getting their data,” says Cypher about the information brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Z1JxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google bans tracking tool that sold users’ location data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621685/google-ban-safegraph-android-user-data-location-tracking"},{"title":"Secret Service bought access to cellphone location data ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371886/secret-service-usss-locate-x-babel-street-foia-contract-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DpBIeM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life360’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.life360.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043228154-Full-Privacy-Policy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;full privacy policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; states:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AwRXzh"&gt;We may share your personal information, including your precise location data, driving sensor data, unique identifiers or AD IDs and other data with our partners, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/privacypolicy"&gt;Cuebiq&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/trusted-partners/%20"&gt;Partners&lt;/a&gt;, for their marketing and business purposes, including without limitation, to inform and improve tailored advertising, attribution, analytics or research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MEIMKD"&gt;When I spoke to Hulls, he said there’s a list of companies that can purchase data from Life360 and that directly identifiable info — such as names and emails — is stripped out. This data is then put on a server that allows permissible companies to further process it and then distribute it to other parties. “No one can just buy someones’ random data,” Hulls said. Life360 also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Funderstanding-how-life360-uses-and-protects-your-data%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22820381%2Ftile-life360-location-tracking-data-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keeps a blog&lt;/a&gt; on its site where it states about 90 percent of its customers are using the “free application experience” and explains how some services are kept free by subsidizing revenues from location and ad data sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yXB3uK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“if we found that the average user had a problem with it, we would re-evaluate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlZc09"&gt;Hulls feels that Life360 providing precise location data equates to the workings of targeted ads and how the industry as a whole, down to media sites like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is doing this. An example he gave was the &lt;em&gt;New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; using “aggregated phone exhaust data.” Hulls is confident that the services Life360 provides in exchange for data are valuable and compared his company to Credit Karma. From his perspective, “They take what’s pretty personal information, they’ve established trust that’s okay, they take your social, your billing, whatever, they give you credit card offers ... we want to do the same with insurance in a very transparent way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIQalv"&gt;In response to the anonymization of location data, Cyphers pointed out that anonymization is a “meaningless buzzword” in terms of location privacy, where simply slapping a device ID on information isn’t enough to separate it from a real person. The phone that stays where you sleep at night, then follows you to your workplace in the morning, and spends weekends at the places you hang out, is unlikely to belong to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc9mnm"&gt;In comparison to services like Credit Karma or insurers that have launched tracking apps or devices, Cyphers pointed out that people join Credit Karma frequently with the “sole intent” of finding a credit card or loan. Signing up for a family safety app, they may not be aware of how much money is changing hands, how much data is being collected, and how those goals could be misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyBuIL"&gt;We asked Hulls if he thinks Life360 has competitors that have not been similarly scrutinized: “I’m not here to call anyone out but am highlighting that the positioning of us as some giant shadow player is simply wrong,” he wrote in an email response. Hulls also says he believes customers are not worried, and that “if we found that the average user had a problem with it, we would re-evaluate, but we haven’t had users complain about it in any meaningful sense.” In a follow-up email asking if users have reported they were unaware of how their data is used and shared, he says, “Less than .1 percent of our inbound customer support emails mention data whatsoever, and most of the ones that come in ask technical questions about our opt-out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jjvhCs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brokered cell location data led to the outing and resignation of a Catholic official ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eia7bW"&gt;Hulls did say there is “theoretically” enough data available in what Life360 sells to identify individuals, but that to the company’s knowledge it has never happened. He cited the belief that companies would casually break their contract and break the law as possible, theoretically, but frustrating to him as an idea because he thinks “it’s a pretty big step that most reputable companies are not going to do.” We asked what would happen if contracted purchasers like X-Mode are confirmed to have sold data identifiable data to the government, and while Hulls would not confirm active investigations, he says it would sue partner companies that breach the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66EHyF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;’s report on the &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data"&gt;location data industry&lt;/a&gt; helps paint the picture of how the demand for user data is seen as an opportunity by companies like Life360. Hulls stated to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; that selling location data is “an important part of our business model that allows us to keep the core Life360 services free” — citing that its features have “improved driver safety and saved numerous lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1639072537.156400"&gt;While Life360 is a safety company selling peace of mind and perhaps a better offer on your insurance, it’s also like many other companies (Google, Facebook, Roku, and Vizio come to mind) where mining the data generated by users could ultimately be more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJqILI"&gt;Though both the company and Tile delivered statements that there are no &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; plans to sell Tile tracker data, real-time location information is sensitive enough that simply trusting anyone to keep it out of the wrong hands is a hard sell. Even with the ability to opt out after registering, rushed decisions to get through the signup process fast could determine who actually owns your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoDC22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 9th, 4:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hulls requested to share his full email response to The Markup, which is now included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch The Game Awards 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N2YDsGO6dQOKfLZfVR-SDyO6n1M=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251164/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbQOlO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/"&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; are back. The awards ceremony / game conference / concert hosted by Geoff Keighley will deliver a couple hours’ worth of performances (notably, Sting will be playing), game reveals (one of which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1464812686244401153?s=20"&gt;over two years in the making&lt;/a&gt;), and almost certainly, a few new memes. There have been very few teases as to what we’ll see onstage, but don’t take that as any indication that this could be a quiet show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1THRf"&gt;A few years ago, this is where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console"&gt;the debut of the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; was an unexpected surprise. I wouldn’t expect any game console announcements for this year’s show. What you can expect (even if you’d rather avoid it) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820270/the-game-awards-red-carpet-core-metaverse"&gt;are some metaverse happenings&lt;/a&gt; that aim to give you a more immersive way to experience the Game Awards. Speaking of topical issues, Geoff Keighley has stated that the Game Awards won’t feature NFTs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817651/activision-blizzard-the-game-awards-harassment"&gt;nor will Activision Blizzard play any role in the show&lt;/a&gt; beyond its nominated titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M75GxQ"&gt;When are The Game Awards 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VOlLAW"&gt;The Game Awards will air live on Thursday, December 9th at 8PM ET / 5PM PT / 1AM GMT. That’s late for our friends in Europe, but if you’re in Japan, you’ll get to watch it first thing in the morning at 9AM. There will be a pre-show beginning a half-hour earlier than the times above, if you want to tune in then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FHn8uM"&gt;How can I watch The Game Awards 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fh5YVs"&gt;Look no further than the top of this page, where we’re hosting a livestream of The Game Awards from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/thegameawards"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (the stream will automatically go live for the 7:30PM ET pre-show). However, there are some other sites hosting it, including &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
