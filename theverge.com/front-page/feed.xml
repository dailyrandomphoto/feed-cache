    <title>Nerf is hiring a chief TikTok officer, and my inner teen is drooling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LwqMsUagAJIqx-zljI6K3jANIpU=/0x0:1922x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69032119/nerf_cto_tiktok.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gb1ttp"&gt;As a ‘90s kid, I used to dream of winning the &lt;a href="https://supermarketsweep.fandom.com/wiki/Nickelodeon_Super_Toy_Run"&gt;Nickelodeon Super Toy Run&lt;/a&gt; — five minutes to fill a Toys R Us shopping cart with anything I liked. I had my route all planned out: stacks of video games, a few choice Lego sets, and then a fill-up at the Nerf aisle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0zi6k"&gt;The world is very different right now, of course, but Nerf may have just announced a modern, grown-up version of the dream: it’s hiring a chief TikTok officer to dream up the company’s marketing for three months, giving one lucky influencer $30,000 and “a massive amount of Nerf products” in exchange for helping Hasbro figure out how to entice Gen Z. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cpyf8i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B72-s3WKft8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c6ytkm"&gt;Oh yeah, this is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a marketing stunt. But it’s also &lt;a href="https://career4.successfactors.com/sfcareer/jobreqcareerpvt?jobId=41110&amp;amp;company=Hasbro&amp;amp;st=24C251E32CBD5E8C43873FDD4671FA248DCF11E0"&gt;a real job on the company’s real career site&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll have to submit a real job application and interview for the role if Hasbro likes what you’ve got. You’ll be expected to create 10–12 TikTok videos per month, meet weekly with Nerf’s marketing team, and — sadly — be 18 or older to get hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tj3W9l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The engineers building ridiculous dart blasters that Nerf won’t touch","url":"https://t.co/wTkR20p6e9?amp=1"},{"title":"Fry’s Electronics is shutting its doors for good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/24/22298616/frys-electronics-going-out-of-business"},{"title":"Nerf reveals Hyper, its next-gen high capacity blasters with the fastest reloads ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22299490/nerf-hyper-announcement-first-blasters-rush-siege-mach"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Flr5Ai"&gt;It’s also completely remote, so you’ll be interfacing through Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or what have you instead of getting a tour of the Nerf labs or archives. Not as fun as could be! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w19hvT"&gt;But still, pretty fun. Here’s hoping this goes to a new face, not an established influencer! If you’re chosen, we’d &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to hear what it was like afterward. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258"&gt;My DMs are open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>H&amp;M and other Western brands gone from Apple Maps and other apps in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ECONOMY-POLITICS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsXUfMrPeIxm-BQGV1upW_8G1LM=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69031683/1231944072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hector Retamal / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eH7Nbo"&gt;Locations for H&amp;amp;M clothing stores in China were not showing up on Apple Maps searches in China on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-m-is-erased-from-chinese-e-commerce-over-xinjiang-stance-11616695377?st=j58swhl0vn8ankj&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, amid growing anger among Chinese consumers at the company’s decision to stop sourcing from the Xinjiang region. The company has more than 400 stores in China, but all H&amp;amp;M locations are now missing from maps, ride-hailing, and e-commerce applications, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; found. Apple relies on Chinese mapping company &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-CJB-16541"&gt;AutoNavi for its Apple Maps in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1zxjE"&gt;It was the latest of several Western brands, which also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/business/hm-nike-xinjiang-cotton-boycott-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;includes Nike and Adidas&lt;/a&gt;, that are facing calls for boycotts in China. The US &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/citing-uighur-mistreatment-u-s-restricts-imports-china-s-xinjiang-n1240039"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; it would stop imports of cotton and other goods from Xinjiang, over allegations the Chinese government uses forced labor in its production. Earlier this week, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-admin-announces-sanctions-against-chinese-officials-over-human-rights-n1261745"&gt;Biden administration announced&lt;/a&gt; it was imposing sanctions against two Chinese officials over what it says are ongoing human rights abuses against China’s Uyghur Muslim population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhuk49"&gt;In response, the Chinese government and state-run media have urged boycotts of Western brands. On Wednesday, The Communist Party’s Youth League in China pointed to H&amp;amp;M’s &lt;a href="https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/fair-and-equal/human-rights/h-m-group-statement-on-due-diligence-/"&gt;statement from last year&lt;/a&gt;, in which the company said it was “deeply concerned by reports from civil society organizations and media that include accusations of forced labor and discrimination of ethnoreligious minorities in Xinjiang.” H&amp;amp;M said it would not source cotton from the Xinjiang region as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyGhiT"&gt;In a statement &lt;a href="https://share.api.weibo.cn/share/211447276.html?weibo_id=4618372530047437"&gt;posted to its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, H&amp;amp;M China said the company did not “represent any political position” and that the company “continues to respect the Chinese consumer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FXNxT"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported that searches for H&amp;amp;M in Apple Maps on an iPhone, or China-based Baidu Maps, did not return any results, while other retailers appeared as normal. H&amp;amp;M was removed from the Alibaba e-commerce platform this week, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgJAcX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 26th 1:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds detail about Apple Maps in China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Suicide Squad’s first trailer steals all the color from the Snyder Cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ldtm1mDpsyoVIoUx2A5JVVI3HBs=/203x0:1714x1007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69031527/Screen_Shot_2021_03_26_at_9.40.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QERtK2"&gt;Warner Bros. has released &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Z1EbSXxrZ34"&gt;the first trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; (no The). Unlike the extremely grimdark &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; (and the potentially even more grimdark black-and-white version of the film, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351394/zack-snyder-justice-league-black-and-white-hbo-max"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; looks to be filled with color and humor, at least based on this first trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yeIUt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Z1EbSXxrZ34"&gt;Here’s the trailer&lt;/a&gt;, which you may have to watch on YouTube because it is age-restricted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9xF5yQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z1EbSXxrZ34?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EBcTA"&gt;I’m getting some serious &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; vibes from &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer — which makes sense, given that both movies are directed by James Gunn. I love the first &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; movie, so I’m hoping Gunn brings some of the humor and heart from that film to &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrRCdv"&gt;The movie features a huge cast, including Margot Robbie reprising her role as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, and John Cena as Peacemaker. Sylvester Stallone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1375485609460965376"&gt;also stars as King Shark&lt;/a&gt;, a giant, walking, talking shark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjTsGX"&gt;The movie hits theaters and HBO Max on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFpFLw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation 5 is available at Best Buy again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOwELLXC4xn2veWpQfTLPz7hm6k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69031521/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DualSense controller comes with every PS5 console.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ivqFA7"&gt;Best Buy has another round of restocks for Sony’s next-generation console, the PS5. You can buy both the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736000233995574746#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a disc drive right now, while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmwcSE"&gt;Due to the high demand for these gadgets, Best Buy is curbing the demand by releasing small waves of stock every few minutes. If you don’t see it in stock immediately, it’s smart to check back every few minutes to see if more show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igu8hA"&gt;Once your new console is secured, you might want to start looking into which games you want to add to your collection. The PS5 is home to some of the most popular titles right now, such as &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0001-PPSA01487_00-ORWFULLGAME00000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736000564545537000#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The console also has some highly anticipated titles arriving for the system in the next few months, such as &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736000586852610719#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736000532729976668#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q9bLmP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yurQ39"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A subscription to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a good purchase. But you’re not just paying to play most games (excluding free-to-play titles) online, as PS5 users with an active PS Plus subscription also have access to a digital library called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which features various first- and third-party titles released during the PS4’s life span. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPmYRp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4iHcU"&gt;If you want a TV that will take full advantage of your new hardware, there are a few TV options available. Including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736001367696964763#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TCL’s new 6-series line of TVs&lt;/a&gt;. These 4K TVs support 120Hz gaming thanks to their HDMI 2.1 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6kv5uy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HRiiTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bEZaIS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="EJuT6Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy an Xbox Series X / Series S right now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="HcJ9BE"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including Best Buy and Target, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times throughout a week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734069351763648754#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x%2FB224744V.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F8wj714n3rbtl%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, in particular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN6oHa"&gt;The Xbox Series S costs $300 and is currently the most affordable ninth-generation home gaming console. It is smaller, less powerful, and lacks a disc drive, limiting you to only playing digital games. The $500 Xbox Series X serves as Microsoft’s flagship gaming console, including a disc drive and more powerful hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cB7Zs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="THxZFV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Xbox Series X / Series S? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W5MxWn"&gt;Whether you purchase the most affordable next-gen console (the Xbox Series S) or Microsoft’s most powerful gaming console to date (Series X), they share many accessories that will help you get the most out of your experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I206y0"&gt;If you plan to share this console and play local co-op games with family or friends, the purchase of an additional controller is a must. Normally $60, the new Xbox controller does get discounted sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="arsXD4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vBlyA0"&gt;If you are planning to subscribe to both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Live-Gold-Membership-Digital/dp/B002VBWIP6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Live Gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend consolidating those separate purchases and subscribing to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. It combines both services into one package, while also providing additional access to Game Pass for PC and access to Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kFcOAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STmdtT"&gt;When it comes to additional storage, both consoles are rather limited: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the Series X. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, but it is very expensive, costing $220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTSdyQ"&gt;There is a solution that can alleviate this until additional SSD options are made available — specifically, using an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally, I would suggest buying an external hard drive if you plan to play some older games so you don’t use up your limited SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LKeRlK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="FLyqG6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X console&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kBFaZ6"&gt;If you are looking to buy Microsoft’s most powerful console to date, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735999168329855367#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, you can try your luck again right now at Best Buy. The retailer also has the more affordable, all-digital &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735999257205594476#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; available for $299.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lX0bv"&gt;Due to the high demand, we expect the supply to run out very quickly, so don’t hesitate if you’re hoping to score one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wZgY01"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="o8XYUW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E69KNJ"&gt;Once you’ve secured your next-gen Xbox, you might want to buy some additional items, such as games to play on your new console. I strongly recommend picking up a subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes a wide array of first- and third-party titles, including a slew of Bethesda games following Microsoft’s acquisition of ZeniMax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KSvvk"&gt;Of course, if you plan to share this console with a loved one, I also recommend buying an extra controller, as the console only comes with one controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7hBd49"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="4P8TmB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg5JXY"&gt;While on the topic of buying new stuff, it’s not a bad idea to get a TV that will take advantage of next-gen hardware. If you have money to spend, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735709730352278220#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling a Vizio 65-inch 4K OLED TV for $1,500 — that is $500 off its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock pulls racist WWE segments from streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2HxrnjYgSLCEBYaTHrgHGUDn9U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69030964/acastro_190909_1777_wwe_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nf3A6p"&gt;It’s been just over a week since WWE Network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319438/wwe-network-peacock-features-price-faq-deal"&gt;moved into Peacock’s streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, but some wrestling fans are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/mc9ia0/peacock_removing_questionable_older_wwe_content/"&gt;already unhappy&lt;/a&gt; with NBCUniversal for removing a few segments from WWE’s past that were objectively in poor taste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu7P0b"&gt;Viewers have noticed that the version of &lt;em&gt;WrestleMania 6&lt;/em&gt; on Peacock no longer includes an interview and match where one side of “Rowdy” Roddy Piper’s body was painted black. Another short clip where WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon’s on-screen character used a racist term has been completely cut from &lt;em&gt;Survivor Series 2005&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5G6Cv"&gt;WWE, particularly in the late ‘90s when the “Attitude Era” made pro wrestling a cultural phenomenon, aired plenty of questionable segments that only come off worse when viewed through a 2021 lens. Some were plainly offensive, openly racist, and should never have happened at the time. Others were downright bizarre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mL2hUb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you think you’re having a bad day, just remember there’s an NBC intern scrolling through WWE’s entire video library, editing out offensive content for the Peacock Network, who is yet to come across Mae Young giving birth to a hand for the first time...&lt;/p&gt;— Wrestling Travel (@WrestlingTravel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WrestlingTravel/status/1375066076493574150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4jyqUz"&gt;Some wrestlers are having fun with the news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVU08a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty sure none of my dads WWF promos are making it to Peacock &lt;br&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;— Brian Pillman Jr. (@FlyinBrianJr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlyinBrianJr/status/1375191231425355783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="igb9KC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Peacock?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Peacock&lt;/a&gt; if you wanted to edit out any of my dancing gimmick from 2003, that’d be okay.&lt;/p&gt;— Lance Storm (@LanceStorm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceStorm/status/1375316140134522881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mz4GjO"&gt;On the WWE Network, these shows were all available in their original form without any obvious cuts or censorship. Rather than delete history, fans have suggested that Peacock should go the same route as Disney Plus and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963014/disney-plus-racism-cultural-disclaimer-dumbo-song-of-the-south-warner-bros-tom-jerry"&gt;show a disclaimer before programming&lt;/a&gt; that’s particularly objectionable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uLP6W"&gt;That doesn’t seem to be the approach Peacock is taking. &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/racist-wwe-moments-are-being-removed-as-classic-matches-move-to-peacock"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NBCUniversal is reviewing the entire WWE video library that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248330/wwe-network-peacock-move-announced-date-price"&gt;it gained from the WWE Network deal&lt;/a&gt;. This partially explains why only a portion of WWE pay-per-views and past shows are available to stream as of right now; Peacock has said it aims to have the whole vault on its service by late August. WWE is being made aware of any changes and edits, the report says. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to both Peacock and WWE for more details and context on how the former plans to approach editing WWE content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fU5wHw"&gt;The standalone WWE Network service is due to shut down in only a matter of days for customers in the United States: it goes offline April 4th. After that, Peacock will be the lone destination with all of this professional wrestling history. Outside the US, the WWE Network will remain operational, and this has led some fans to seek out VPN options to maintain access to the service they’re familiar with, and one that preserves WWE’s past just as it happened — even the awful bits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW and PG&amp;E think electric vehicles could stabilize California grid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EV smart charging" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLPOZL-nQmU2HKrD7C6Jo8uze8s=/0x0:4875x3250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69030912/P90375018_highRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMW and PG&amp;amp;E are partnering to find out if electric vehicles can support California’s struggling grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X8Jpm3"&gt;As blackouts become more common during California’s fire season, utility PG&amp;amp;E is looking to electric vehicles as one potential backup plan for the state’s stressed-out grid. It’s been working with carmaker BMW to test whether electric vehicles could provide power when there’s an outage or not enough energy to meet demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYBjWx"&gt;Theoretically, a network of EV batteries could one day provide a backup source of energy for communities called a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523976/virtual-power-plants-solar-energy-grid-resilience-climate-change"&gt;virtual power plant&lt;/a&gt;.” But first, automakers and utilities will need to see if it’s worth it to work with each other. Then, they’ll need to get their customers on board, too. BMW and PG&amp;amp;E’s partnership is a sort of test run for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmleDE"&gt;The two companies started working together in 2015. Until now, the pair has mostly focused on increasing the amount of renewable energy used to charge EV batteries. It’s a strategy called “smart-charging” that encourages EV owners to charge their cars during times of the day when there is less electricity demand and more available renewable energy, like solar power. Starting this week, they’re expanding the program, and PG&amp;amp;E customers who drive electric or hybrid BMWs &lt;a href="https://www.pge.com/en/about/newsroom/newsdetails/index.page?title=20210322_pge_and_bmw_group_taking_next_step_in_powering_electric_vehicles_with_renewable_energy_and_supporting_grid_reliability"&gt;can apply for&lt;/a&gt; a 24-month “smart-charging” pilot program and earn cash incentives when they charge their cars during recommended hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYYsHy"&gt;The cars won’t be selling energy back to the grid, but the program could give PG&amp;amp;E some early insight into when and where drivers charge their cars, according to Adam Langton, an energy services manager at BMW of North America. That’ll be key for getting drivers on board for vehicle-to-grid charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8CfMr"&gt;The two companies also said they would begin testing hardware in a lab this year. BMW needs to know how often PG&amp;amp;E might ask drivers to connect to the grid and what toll that might take on the car. PG&amp;amp;E needs to know how much energy a car battery can provide and for how long. They’re also figuring out what additional infrastructure might be needed at someone’s home and across the grid to make all of this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EwnLhu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;PG&amp;amp;E’s territory is a fertile testing ground for vehicle-to-grid technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KOs8zn"&gt;PG&amp;amp;E, which is based in San Francisco, serves a territory that’s a fertile testing ground for vehicle-to-grid technology. It’s already home to more than 320,000 electric vehicles. That’s roughly 20 percent of all electric cars in the US, according to the utility. By 2030, 5 million EVs are expected to be on the road in California. (Last year, California became the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;first state&lt;/a&gt; to ban the future sale of internal combustion engines.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCkifD"&gt;All of those new EVs could put more pressure on an already-strained, aging grid system in the US. But tapping EV batteries for their energy storage capabilities could also provide a boost to the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6M5fO"&gt;“The amount of energy storage you have driving on four wheels is much more than any electric utility will ever build and put on the grid. So it now starts to make sense that you use this as a resource to stabilize the grid,” Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451642/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-energy-grid-battery-day-elon-musk"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said its future vehicles will be able to connect to the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUaayX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;BMW’s upcoming i4&lt;/a&gt;, its first fully electric sedan, is supposed to be able to drive up to 300 miles on a single charge of its 80kWh battery pack. Since most commuters don’t regularly drive that far in a single day, they could one day choose to sell some of that unused energy back to the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1tgFU"&gt;In a separate initiative, BMW plans to test the first 50 i3 cars capable of backfeeding energy to the grid in Germany starting in June. &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/11/28/nissan-energy-leaf-vehicle-to-home-building/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; and Honda have also looked into so-called “bi-directional charging.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="VZPk0Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With enough EVs connected to the grid, they could become sizable “virtual power plants”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykxuhR"&gt;With enough EVs connected to the grid, they could become sizable “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523976/virtual-power-plants-solar-energy-grid-resilience-climate-change"&gt;virtual power plants&lt;/a&gt;.” These are basically just networks of connected batteries that utilities might be able to call upon collectively when they need more juice. Interconnected &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403271/virtual-power-plants-california-apartment-buildings-solar-energy"&gt;residential solar power systems&lt;/a&gt; can also serve the same purpose. The hope is that by working together, all of those batteries can alleviate stress on the grid whenever there’s peak demand. Virtual power plants could also replace polluting, fossil-fueled “peaker plants” that utilities have historically relied on when they’re short on energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ilpOf"&gt;Virtual power plants can also supply energy if a disaster like a storm or fire forces a power plant offline. Since a virtual power plant is a more “distributed” source of energy (meaning it’s made up of a bunch of batteries spread out across many people’s homes), it’s less likely to suffer a complete failure during a single disaster than a more centralized power source like a power plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t85RxS"&gt;After investigators found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18626819/cal-fire-pacific-gas-and-electric-camp-fire-power-lines-cause"&gt;PG&amp;amp;E’s transmission lines sparked&lt;/a&gt; the deadly 2018 Camp Fire in California, the utility started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908434/california-blackouts-utilities-fires-lawsuits-san-francisco-bay-area-pge-pacific-gas-electric"&gt;implementing preemptive outages&lt;/a&gt; during fire season in an effort to prevent another blaze. In that scenario, car batteries could potentially provide power to their owners’ homes once the lights go out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkCsy2"&gt;When asked whether PG&amp;amp;E is working with any other automakers on vehicle-to-grid technology, product manager Maria Sanz said in an email that the company “expect[s] to have more to share on this topic later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJCXaR"&gt;BMW is still a small player when it comes to electric vehicles, with just one fully electric vehicle model available in the US. And even if the world’s leading EV-maker, Tesla, plans to build bidirectional charging cars in the future, Musk admittedly isn’t a fan of the technology. “Very few people would actually use vehicle-to-grid,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451642/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-energy-grid-battery-day-elon-musk"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt; during Tesla’s Battery Day last year. (Tesla already sells home batteries called Powerwalls, which can also be used to form virtual power plants, to accompany its solar panels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qvtbza"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We think that the drivers are going to be willing to participate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0VjlZn"&gt;In the past, car manufacturers and consumers have been concerned about whether vehicle-to-grid charging might prematurely wear out car batteries. As a part of its tests, BMW plans to study how well its batteries would hold up if they’re called on by PG&amp;amp;E to provide energy — and by extension, whether it makes sense for its customers to plug into the grid at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fBp5D"&gt;Figuring out how they can actually get customer buy-in will be another big part of BMW and PG&amp;amp;E’s joint initiative. “From our perspective, we think that the drivers are going to be willing to participate in [vehicle-to-grid charging], but we need to do that in a way that doesn’t compromise their mobility,” says Langton. Future EVs might be able to do wonders for the grid, but that can’t come at the cost of their main job: driving. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Nvidia’s DLSS could make the new Nintendo Switch better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hk5kgac3w4g0ymGhw3iw3lHq9yI=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69030713/nvidia_dlss_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rNwaob"&gt;You’ve probably seen the acronym “DLSS” appearing in more gaming and tech stories recently. You might know that it’s an Nvidia graphics thing, and that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;might be coming to the new Nintendo Switch console&lt;/a&gt; that’s rumored to release later in 2021, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But, really, what is it, and why does it matter? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJD5Ra"&gt;DLSS stands for deep learning super sampling, and it’s a way for Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards to work smarter, not necessarily harder, by running games at a lower resolution, then using dedicated AI cores to improve visual quality with less of the usual performance cost. The deep learning component works on the fly to make your game look as if you haven’t lowered its resolution at all. This feature only works with supported PC games, of which there are over 20 at the time of publishing, including &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7KwG4W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What we actually want from an upgraded Nintendo Switch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="l9yKgW"&gt;On PC, the technique has proven itself to yield a sizable performance boost. Especially with the advent of ray tracing tech, DLSS has been a boon for letting gamers experience all of the latest visual effects on high-resolution displays without having to shell out an exorbitant amount for a GPU. It’s available for GPUs that (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;nominally&lt;/a&gt;) cost just a few hundred dollars, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the previous-gen RTX 20-series cards (not that you can find any of them available right now). For a device like the Nintendo Switch that can’t cram in that much horsepower to begin with, you can imagine why it might be an amazing fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG118b"&gt;Nintendo’s current Switch uses a shrunken-down version of Nvidia’s Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip from 2015. Most games run at sub-1080p resolution when docked and usually less than the 720p resolution of the Switch’s display when in portable mode. Developers for the Switch are already used to making some sizable compromises to get their games working well on the portable console. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7kwJInAvFgT-1Mgc947lJRezF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22162239/doom_eternal_switch_screenshot01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;em&gt; running on the Switch.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5OeyOD"&gt;Panic Button’s porting work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22169262/doom-eternal-switch-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16627782/doom-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, heavily rely on visual tricks like dynamic resolution, motion blur, and lower-fidelity textures to mask the Switch’s inherent weaknesses compared to other consoles — and to get them running at a playable 30 frames per second even on the Switch’s 720p screen, much less 4K. Other games struggle to come close to rendering at that resolution — &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein: Youngblood&lt;/em&gt; usually runs at a 540p resolution in portable mode, according to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kSnz46HiLLc?t=250"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;and even Nintendo’s own &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; has notable slowdown, though the company has a few other shining examples that manage 60 frame-per-second gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcXg4z"&gt;With all of this context in mind, the recent rumors that the next Switch will tap DLSS to help it avoid those compromises has me excited. We don’t know whether Nvidia truly plans to stick an RTX-style graphics chip with Tensor Core AI processors into a Switch just to achieve DLSS, but doing so would make the next generation of Switch games (and perhaps preexisting games) look and run much better, whether in portable mode or displaying a higher resolution while docked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9iIrU"&gt;Of course, games on the Nintendo Switch would likely need to be individually patched to support DLSS, like the fairly small amount of games on PC have been. If games that have DLSS support on PC get a Switch port, will that DLSS work carry over, I wonder? Or, unlikely as it seems, can Nintendo and Nvidia work together to make every game compatible with DLSS in some way to ensure boosted performance across the board? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/85l11DRXOAMoOPfO_zAdzVaWYG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19086556/akrales_190820_3597_0065.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o70qi3"&gt;DLSS 2.0 is the current version that’s available on PC, and it brought better performance and efficiency of RTX AI cores versus the first iteration. &lt;a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/73883/nvidias-next-gen-ampere-dlss-3-0-could-work-on-any-game-that-uses-taa/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TweakTown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cites a YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qMMm9nHFe0Y"&gt;video from channel Moore’s Law is Dead&lt;/a&gt; claiming that a newer DLSS 3.0 version could be in development for GPUs built with the latest Ampere architecture. It’s said to automatically deliver AI enhancements to &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;game with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Ftxaa%2Ftechnology%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F26%2F22348095%2Fnintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;temporal anti-aliasing&lt;/a&gt; (a technique that removes the flickering aliased edges of textures — especially when the camera is in motion), not just the games that have been patched for support. If true, it could make Nintendo’s job a lot easier bringing DLSS features to more games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLHKfj"&gt;To get a sense of how the next Switch could benefit from DLSS without requiring immensely powerful hardware, check out this informative video below that the folks at &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; put together. It focuses on the game &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; running with DLSS enabled at different resolutions. The bit that really stood out to me was when it showed just how good DLSS can make a 540p rendering of the game look when reconstructed into a 1080p image with ray tracing effects and everything set to ultra settings. I’ve time-stamped the video to that exact location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l81NuL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YWIKzRhYZm4?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=629&amp;amp;start=629" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UbW71q"&gt;If that’s what a PC can do with 540p, a Switch with DLSS might not need a huge overhaul to make its own collection of sub-720p games look a lot better than they do today, particularly on the Switch’s relatively small screen where DLSS’s minor wrinkles might be even easier to forgive than they are on a PC monitor. If it gets additional graphical muscle, it’s not a stretch to imagine today’s games competently running at a simulated 4K when docked to a TV as well. This kind of thing would be perfect to showcase at the launch of the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="509t0P"&gt;Since the original Nintendo Switch launched, 4K TVs have become more widely adopted. So, it’ll make sense if Nintendo wants to use hardware that’ll look better on modern televisions. And whatever the company chooses to put in its next Switch, it’ll ultimately still be a mobile processor with limitations compared to what the likes of the Xbox Series X and PS5 can do. Though, hopefully, it will be enough to ensure that future Switch games look far better than they currently do for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It Takes Two is Josef Fares’ latest attempt to show the power of co-op gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSG8Dv-ZzQjg5M1DpQEE29G-K4Y=/139x0:1555x944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69030608/Screen_Shot_2021_03_26_at_9.19.53_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIcuXz"&gt;Josef Fares has strong opinions. The director of Hazelight Studio — whose latest co-op game, &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt;, is out today — rocketed into the spotlight at The Game Awards in 2017 with an off-the-cuff, impassioned speech about the joys of interactive video games that culminated in &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/7/16749886/a-way-out-josef-fares-rant-game-awards-tga-2017"&gt;his meme-worthy “Fuck the Oscars!” line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLzPaT"&gt;Years later, Fares (who, ironically enough, started off as a filmmaker) is still standing firm on his pro-game stance. “Look, my background is a filmmaker. The whole thing with ‘fuck the Oscars’ was actually kind of special,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “One, you have to remember when I was there on the set, everybody was talking, ‘Oh this like the Oscars, it’s like the Oscars.’ And I was like ‘Fuck the Oscars!’ because I was actually saying ‘Fuck the Oscars — because we should celebrate gaming now.’ It’s not that I have anything personal about the Oscars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kGuY8w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A Way Out’s clever co-op play is dragged down by a cliche crime story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17151056/a-way-out-coop-multiplayer-review-ps4-xbox-one"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VNRlui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; is Fares’ third game, following &lt;em&gt;Brothers:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A Tale of Two Sons&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17151056/a-way-out-coop-multiplayer-review-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Way Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Hazelight’s latest game takes a similar tack to &lt;em&gt;A Way Out&lt;/em&gt;, in particular: it’s an exclusively co-op game that you can’t experience at all unless you’re willing to play with a friend or partner (either next to you on a couch or over the internet). According to Fares, the studio never even considered adding any sort of AI companion. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gL6elTeKP3tlb-SgPO53QMn8Huc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399557/Screen_Shot_2021_03_26_at_9.19.59_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp5Ujn"&gt;“They are designed from the beginning like that, so you have to communicate with someone,” he says. “It’s not possible to play with a random [person]. It’s not a matchmaking game where you are just randomly connected. If you want to play with someone you don’t know at all, you must have the ability to talk because if you’re not talking, you can’t progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gONpl"&gt;Communication is a fitting foundation for&lt;em&gt; It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt;, which sees a husband and wife on the verge of divorce who are then magically transformed into a pair of Pixar-esque dolls and forced by a magical talking book to work out their differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf1T5B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Way O&lt;/em&gt;ut offered a thematically compelling narrative pulled out of a crime novel that was let down by dull gameplay that didn’t actually do much to take advantage of the cooperative nature of the game. &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; flips the script: it offers a bizarre, almost nonsensical story lifted up by clever cooperative mechanics. Each of the two characters tends to split up their abilities between levels. For example, an early level gives players a pair of guns — one character can fire sap, while the other ignites it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocvs4m"&gt;The more diverse gameplay isn’t an accident. “We’ve become better at finding cold co-op mechanics that can be combined,” says Fares. “So you really feel the need of co-oping. Also, I talked a lot about marrying the story and the gameplay... we tried to connect the abilities to the character as well. With May, for instance — it’s her toolbox, so she has the hammer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1DiFL"&gt;The result, though, is that &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; is a much more complex game than &lt;em&gt;A Way Out&lt;/em&gt;. To start, it’s a platformer. And while it won’t demand the kind of pixel-perfect skills as something like &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a harder game to get into than the relatively simple &lt;em&gt;A Way Out&lt;/em&gt;. Add in the (admittedly more interesting) new mechanics that change from level to level, and the game runs the risk of overwhelming newer or less experienced players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HW0N6a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why not enjoy a story together in a game?” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nC6NT3"&gt;Still, the resulting game is a unique one, despite the uneven storytelling. As Fares rightly comments, there’s almost no one else out there making these kinds of games. “Of course there are co-op games out there that have your campaign and your add-on co-op campaign and so on, but none are actually designing, writing everything from the beginning as we do at Hazelight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYvRXD"&gt;“I think that opens up... both creatively, but also the dynamics between the characters that you’re playing, that you’re using different abilities, how you can cooperate, and also what’s going on on the couch,” says Fares. “I think there’s so much stuff to explore there.” He views the experience as similar to watching a movie or a TV show: it’s something you do together. “So why not enjoy a story together in a game?” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R7d4v1Eh7REMin5IaPmOA3EyYyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399560/Screen_Shot_2021_03_26_at_9.20.04_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rg6jy7"&gt;And it’s that level of interaction that helps games stand out to Fares from film. “The whole idea is understanding that making the interactive experience [for a game is] totally different than a passive experience as a movie,” he says. “So I sometimes hear when they talk about ‘We should bring on more movie people [to make games].’ Sure, we can be inspired on how they tell stories and so on, but we need to find our own way to tell stories in an interactive way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxUGTl"&gt;And while Fares won’t give too many details on what Hazelight’s next project will look like or if it’ll be another co-op experience, he definitely thinks there’s more room for other developers to join in — and not just with optional cooperative experiences, like with survival games or shooters like &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXhT23"&gt;“We should have our single-player narratives; I love those. But I think there’s a market here, and I think people really appreciate this type of game, you know. To play something with someone that you love or a friend or a father or a mother or whatever — just experience something together and not just a shooter game, you know what I mean?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ska5J8"&gt;&lt;small&gt;It Takes Two &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
