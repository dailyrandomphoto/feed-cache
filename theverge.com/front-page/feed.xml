    <title>How the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 stacks up to the Surface Laptop Studio, Go 3, and more</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i0aKwb"&gt;At its recent hardware event, Microsoft refreshed almost its entire lineup of Surface products (sorry, Surface Book, but you’re sitting this one out). The company showed off the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Go 3&lt;/a&gt;, and it capped off the proceedings with details about its interesting and transforming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686706/microsoft-surface-studio-laptop-design-specs-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;. There was more at the event, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679573/microsoft-surface-pro-x-display-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Wi-Fi version of the Pro X&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686707/microsoft-surface-duo-2-phone-design-specs-features-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; folding phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;Here are all of the biggest announcements&lt;/a&gt; if you wanted to see them in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="belu8g"&gt;If you’re trying to figure out which of these new Windows 11-equipped machines you should buy, knowing their specs might help you make a decision. But given that they’re different sizes and marketed to different kinds of people, professions, and hobbies, this isn’t exactly a level playing field. And we won’t know exactly how they perform until we review, which will likely happen sometime in October. To give you a little more context, we’ve added the Surface Laptop 4 into the table below since it’s a relatively new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IICn8"&gt;Until then, here are all of the specs that matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6UV4Dx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder all of the new Surface hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683783/microsoft-surface-pro-x-8-3-go-laptop-studio-preorder-price-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="kNXo4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10767940"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tiger King is returning for a second season on Netflix later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxh1KQwMWKmuBOVhSoJBe_d9rLg=/288x0:2106x1212/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897843/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_10.13.03_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wtf9WL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/tiger-king-2-leads-pack-of-upcoming-documentaries-exploring-crimes-cons-and"&gt;Netflix has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202720/tiger-king-documentary-review-netflix-joe-exotic"&gt;hit documentary &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be returning for a second season later in 2021, following the success of the first season — which hit streaming just as the COVID-19 pandemic began and is indelibly associated with the early days of COVID lockdown culture, a mix of heady escapism at a time when leaving home seemed impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="knuuH6"&gt;
&lt;p id="eqdEsY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s March 2020. Everyone is stuck at home due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bored with nowhere to go, no one to see, and nothing to do, you — along with millions of others, boot up Netflix and find a new documentary series called Tiger King, a salacious, practically unbelievable story of the rise and fall of self-made tiger zoo magnate Joe Exotic (and his rivalry with fellow tiger aficionado Carol Baskin). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cBWko"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hit play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gzeFKo"&gt;
&lt;p id="S0dmEC"&gt;There isn’t too much information about the upcoming second season — only that it will bring “just as much mayhem and madness as Season 1,” which seems like a high bar to clear. Netflix hasn’t even announced a hard release date or debuted a trailer yet, either; the announcement came as part of the company’s reveal of its upcoming true crime documentary slate, which also includes &lt;em&gt;The Puppet Master: Hunting the Ultimate Conman, The Tinder Swindler, Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bad Vegan (&lt;/em&gt;all of which are A.) real shows and movies, and B.) all debuting in 2022). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rrNk3m"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tiger King is coming back this year — and Season 2 promises just as much mayhem and madness as Season 1! &lt;a href="https://t.co/mFBUxtAl6i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mFBUxtAl6i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1441039660415795201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cHgbRz"&gt;
&lt;p id="7YVZoA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s sometime in 2021. Everyone is still stuck at home because of the still raging Delta variant of COVID-19. Bored with nowhere to go, no one to see, and nothing to do, you — along with millions of others, boot up Netflix and watch the newly announced season two of Tiger King, which delves deeper into the strange tale of Joe Exotic. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xncVbu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hit play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YLrZ1b"&gt;
&lt;p id="W8O58d"&gt;Given that Exotic himself is currently in federal prison, it’ll be interesting to see what parts of the story Netflix is focusing on in the upcoming second season. That said, with how popular the show was when it first debuted (even if some of that &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/nicolas-cage-joe-exotic-amazon-tiger-king-series-scrapped/"&gt;attention has since waned&lt;/a&gt;), it’s obvious that Netflix would want to try and capture the magic a second time with a sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="geFYe8"&gt;
&lt;p id="ff9bio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s sometime in 202X. Everyone is still stuck at home because of the still raging Omega variant of COVID-19. Bored with nowhere to go, no one to see, and nothing to do, you — along with millions of others, crank up your hand generator and boot up Netflix and watch the newly announced season six of Tiger King, detailing the rise of the Tiger King Joe Exotic, Ruler of the Middle United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vF3hc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You sigh and press play. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RRAINg"&gt;
&lt;p id="vOaV9v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; season 2 will arrive on Netflix later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPadOS 15 ruined my iPad’s homescreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ediFrrEth4WP4a4mUR1Txvld0dw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897795/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDjasA"&gt;There’s a lot of promise and potential in iPadOS 15. Even with some features like SharePlay missing from the initial release, others like Quick Note and a dramatically simpler approach to multitasking already improve the day-to-day experience of using Apple’s tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNeARK"&gt;But Apple sure did manage to bungle the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Us0h3"&gt;As my colleague Chaim mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;in his review of iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, the homescreen layout is no longer consistent between vertical and horizontal orientations. I’ve been using the 12.9-inch iPad Pro since 2018, and as of iPadOS 14, the homescreen grid was always 6 x 5 no matter how the iPad was being held. This allowed me to set up dedicated rows for things like photo editing (I edit many of my review photos on the iPad), audio apps, video apps, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Y7qdEYsDxwihGVkkhPjVAB1B28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871871/iPadOS14Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See how icon positioning stayed the same on iPadOS 14? That was nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LvsNsI"&gt;But with iPadOS 15, Apple threw a wrench into all that. When the iPad is in landscape mode, I still get the 6 x 5 layout. But now, as soon as I switch to vertical / portrait, the grid inexplicably changes to 5 x 6, with icons flowing down into the row below them. So much for my attempts at organization and keeping things tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgylnT"&gt;It’s a frustrating change, and it results in a very obvious amount of wasted space at the sides of the screen. The icon spacing in vertical orientation gets almost comical on this large, pixel-rich display if you do drop in some widgets, as you’ll see later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89h7yM"&gt;The best explanation I’ve seen for this reduction in icon density is that it was necessary to support the more flexible widget placement and still keep everything looking somewhat uniform and aesthetically pleasing. It also has to do with how Apple maps out widgets on the homescreen. In his review of iOS and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Federico Viticci surmised that Apple chose to “return to a non-dense grid that allows for both widgets and icons at the same time.” But I’m just not on board. Particularly on iPads, we’re at the point where at least having the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; for a more tightly-packed grid would unlock new promise and creativity. Apple still doesn’t even permit empty gaps between icons or widgets. Instead, the company remains weirdly dedicated to its restrictive, always-from-the-top-left placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYVlXj"&gt;I’m sure there are many fantastic widgets out there at this point, and the new XL size — exclusive to the iPad — does open up more possibilities for calendar widgets and other productivity tools. But personally, I just don’t find myself using them often, and I was perfectly okay with the old style of keeping widgets anchored to the left of the main homescreen, where they could be pulled into view when needed and then easily dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7Bo9TghTSuk_fKEwrSbEuWyUSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871872/iPadOS14widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPadOS 14 only supported widgets in the “today view.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ujVpY6"&gt;But then we move on to iPadOS 15. And my first criticism comes right at the start. For some reason, Apple finds it appropriate to plop several widgets onto your iPad’s homescreen immediately after the update, which will throw whatever ordering you had before into disarray. It looks quite bad. Here’s mine on first boot following the iPadOS 15 upgrade, where in portrait we drop from five columns to four... on a 12.9-inch screen… all for the purpose of showcasing widgets:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pgAcDmSv2KTwqXYcaRkjgbuodA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871875/iPadOS15firstboot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homescreen chaos. What a wonderful introduction to a new software update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zhuJxE"&gt;Yikes. What a ham-fisted way of introducing a new feature to customers. Why not just &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; these more flexible, put-them-where-you-want widgets in a post-update video instead of wrecking actual homescreens? I’d be irked if some macOS update dumped a bunch of random junk onto my desktop, and I’m similarly annoyed by what Apple’s done here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RdruIX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I can’t be the only iPad user to install iPadOS 15 and frown at seeing how its home screen widgets broke up a painstakingly-organized app icon grid.&lt;/p&gt;— Rob Pegoraro (@robpegoraro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robpegoraro/status/1440091473496707072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tRFFgE"&gt;It also illustrates the significant tradeoff that comes with widgets: as soon as you add even one, no matter the size, you’re down to just four columns for that homescreen in portrait mode. On a display as expansive as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, that’s brutal. And again, it’s all because of Apple’s fixation with the grid. This is a problem of the company’s own making. At least you can cram a ton of apps into the dock, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="af2GHX"&gt;With a little rearranging, I was able to get back to where things were before — but only in the landscape orientation. As I mentioned earlier, portrait is now limited to a 5 x 6 grid (even when no widgets are present), and there’s no setting to change this back to the old layout. All that wasted space. And for what? This is even noticeable on smaller iPads; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/T-UhbAcZd3I"&gt;in his review of the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, Marques Brownlee couldn’t help but notice the padding on both sides of the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYtdK61eQa2zjm3-9dsMUBgOjhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871888/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_8.58.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-UhbAcZd3I" target="_blank"&gt;MKBHD (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the new iPad Mini has wasted homescreen potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9VXBK"&gt;It’s fair to point out that in iPadOS 14, there was wasted screen real estate at the top and bottom of the icon grid when in vertical orientation. But I think it’s far better for familiarity and muscle memory to maintain the same app positioning and layout in both scenarios, so I found that acceptable. This? Not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lYkfB3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPadOS15?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPadOS15&lt;/a&gt; widget and icon placement is absolute madness, especially when changing orientation &lt;a href="https://t.co/wQrFZ7rXYK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wQrFZ7rXYK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Finnen (@danfinnen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danfinnen/status/1440039844349034499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz5IAj"&gt;What frustrates me most about the new homescreen is that it’s impossible to make rows for specific purposes, since one icon will always reflow into the next row when you hold the iPad in portrait. Sure, folders exist, but that’s an extra tap. Some have pointed out that iPadOS 15 now allows you to customize different layouts for the homescreen when in portrait or landscape, and it will remember what goes where. That’s neat. But the initial jumbled mess when changing orientations is jarring, and having separate layouts doesn’t fix the issue of icons jumping around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GIR-UTJDerc9Xq59_BdkVltJdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871876/iPadOS15Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With iPadOS 15, the homescreen is 6 x 5 in landscape and 5 x 6 in portrait. (Total icons vary by iPad type and screen size.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="38hdG4"&gt;As of the new update, Apple has also ditched the convenient landscape “today view” that displayed the date and time with widgets underneath — all while keeping your apps in easy reach. Your choices now are to put widgets directly on the homescreen or, if you prefer to keep them off, you can swipe right for this blurred slide-over version, which is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, but less elegant:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1C_itHJ5DiQ7TDYRbxGyelyOhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871878/iPadOS15widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The nice homescreen today view is gone, but you can still slide in widgets from the left if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5lKba"&gt;Some will see this as a very minor inconvenience and carry on with updating to iPadOS 15 for all of the other benefits. Since the App Library is now there, you can even go in the complete &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; direction and load your homescreens up with widgets everywhere and only a few app icons. If that’s you, don’t let me stop you. On the whole, it’s a very good release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5qRVB"&gt;But I’m really hoping in a future software update, Apple will add a setting to restore the old layout that kept everything more consistent. It’d be even better if the company made the grid more customizable on the whole. If we’re letting people choose between new and old Safari designs, why not offer a choice between having more things on-screen or a less dense grid that’s better optimized for widgets? There’s already a “Home Screen and Dock” section of settings, after all. Letting you adjust the grid to your liking is something that Android phones and tablets already get right. It’s not a huge ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2xBhv"&gt;For me, widgets aren’t worth the homescreen looking different based on how I’m holding my iPad. And I’m not alone, with other iPad owners on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-15-we-are-stuck-with-6x5-apps-on-home-screen-now.2299988/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadPro/comments/pskv7t/ios_15_only_5_icons_per_row/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere venting about these changes. Some of them have downgraded back to iPadOS 14.8 until there’s a solution. I’ve now done so for the second time (I needed those screenshots) even if I’ll miss Quick Note, the much-improved multitasking, and other refinements of iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7OWzt"&gt;I don’t know how long I’ll stay on the older software. Once iPadOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/psplhz/i_dont_want_them_to_fix_this_ipados_15/"&gt;a little more polished&lt;/a&gt; or adds SharePlay back in, I might update. But a familiar homescreen that works the way I expect counts for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqbGbSGmH85GkDjjYs0cJoIf2Gs=/244x0:2545x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897757/Screen_Shot_2017_09_14_at_11.51.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OBqCUT"&gt;The European Commission has announced plans to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;fit a common USB-C charging port&lt;/a&gt; on their devices. Given that most Android-powered smartphones now ship with a USB-C port, the proposals could see Apple finally be forced to move to USB-C on the iPhone. Or they might not, as they could instead force Apple to deliver a portless iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSAFOc"&gt;Today’s proposals from the EU only cover wired charging and don’t seek to enforce rules on wireless charging just yet. A spokesperson for the Commission has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that if a device charges only wirelessly, then there is no requirement to integrate a USB-C charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsiayr"&gt;If the European Parliament adopts the proposals, manufacturers will have 24 months to comply with the new rules. That gives Apple a lot of time to create a portless iPhone if it wants to avoid USB-C altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Lightning connector stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgBlGYJBs257ZkkwLiaYzRGZVP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1362261/lightningapple.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Lightning connector has existed for nearly 10 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYjoXg"&gt;Apple has notoriously avoided USB-C on the iPhone, despite adopting it on many iPad and MacBook models. While the EU says its proposals are driven by environmental incentives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;Apple has argued&lt;/a&gt; that a switch to USB-C would actually be worse for the environment because it renders hundreds of millions of Lightning accessories obsolete. These arguments might be irrelevant if Apple goes portless, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZOLVj"&gt;Rumors of an iPhone without any ports have circulated for years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage"&gt;Apple had the “courage”&lt;/a&gt; to kill off the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and make it clear wireless was the future for headphones. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;analysts originally predicted&lt;/a&gt; that this year’s iPhone would ship without any ports, ditching the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojIaWa"&gt;That clearly hasn’t happened with the iPhone 13, but it doesn’t mean it’s not far off. The world of wireless charging is increasingly complicated, and interoperability isn’t always guaranteed, but things are moving quickly. The OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging, meaning the phone will fully charge in 43 minutes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;Xiaomi also announced&lt;/a&gt; its next salvo in the wireless charging wars last year, thanks to an 80W wireless charger. Xiaomi claims it can charge a 4,000mAh battery fully in just 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LOzlCNU7jLmQ2z3t-6SttSCcSNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9241503/airpower.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirPower didn’t work out for Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U7SEIJ"&gt;Apple’s experiences with wireless charging haven’t been as impressive, though. Apple’s AirPower wireless charger was supposed to arrive with the unique ability to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple canceled AirPower in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, citing difficulties in bringing the product to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJaFRk"&gt;The new iPhone 13 Pro supports wireless charging over the Qi standard at up to 7.5 watts and up to 15 watts using MagSafe wireless charging. Both of these are still slower than the fast-charge capable cables you can use to charge an iPhone with. Like anything Apple, the company is probably prototyping better wireless charging methods that will follow years after the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJpOT8"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that Apple has no plans to ditch the Lightning port on the iPhone in “the foreseeable future” and could move straight to a portless iPhone that relies exclusively on its MagSafe wireless charging standard instead. “If the ‌iPhone‌ abandons Lightning in the future, it may directly adopt a portless design with ‌MagSafe‌ support instead of using a USB-C port,“ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;said Kuo earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro ships with a Lightning port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gGULFs"&gt;Such a move could be driven by Apple’s desire to protect its MFi licensing business instead of moving to USB-C. Apple makes money off of every Lightning cable and accessory sold by way of licensing fees from the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/"&gt;MFi accessory program&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also controls the MagSafe standard through its MFi program, ensuring it captures licensing fees on some wireless charging accessories for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHV8aM"&gt;If Apple is able to move to a portless iPhone before the two-year grace period from the European Commission, it could still be on a collision course for future clashes over charging standards, though. While the EU admits wireless charging is “not seen as a replacement for wired charging at the moment because of the efficiency rates of such chargers,” it does leave the door open to look at this technology at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1G4PP"&gt;“It is also necessary to provide the basis for adaption to any future technological progress by introducing a harmonization of the charging interfaces and the charging communication protocols with respect to radio equipment that may be charged via any means other than wired charging, including charging via radio waves (wireless charging),” says the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATH9yl"&gt;If Apple continues to support the Qi wireless charging standard, then it could avoid further scrutiny if it does move to a portless iPhone in the future. But if MagSafe comes to dominate, we could be back in an EU battle over charging standards once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jake Gyllenhaal on the challenges of acting over Zoom in Netflix’s thriller The Guilty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="the guilty" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtb68jNLwqHj_j2kDIKQTQSplxI=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897659/Guilty_20201120_2367_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Glen Wilson / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x293Ad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; was always going to be a challenging project. The movie, which is a remake of a Danish film from 2018, follows a 911 dispatcher in Los Angeles, who receives a troubling call that appears to be from a woman who has been abducted. The result is a tense thriller, but one you see almost none of — the entire movie is centered on LAPD officer Joe Baylor, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, as he fields phone calls in an office over the course of a single evening. Because of this, the movie hinges on Gyllenhaal’s performance, as he slowly unravels while the story twists and turns in disturbing ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq0Hlw"&gt;But it became even more challenging thanks to pandemic-related restrictions on filming. While the actors were on set, director Antoine Fuqua, who previously worked with Gyllenhaal on the boxing drama &lt;em&gt;Southpaw&lt;/em&gt;, was in a van a block away, directing remotely. Meanwhile, everyone on the other end of the phone — which includes the likes of Peter Sarsgaard and Ethan Hawke — was working from home. Production on &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; ended up relying on a mishmash of various forms of communication, from FaceTime to Zoom to plain old walkie-talkies. “We had to discover, and were constantly trying to learn as we went,” Gyllenhaal tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think we got a system down on day 11 — and then we were done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32b1z1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaB_ERMAZu4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sXmCaz"&gt;The filming setup was complicated. Because someone close to Fuqua tested positive, he was forced to sit in a van that was hardwired to the set and outfitted with all of the gadgets he’d need to direct. “I had monitors and computers and walkie-talkies and spycams,” he says. From here he had a bird’s-eye view of the set and was able to talk to his first assistant director and other staff via a walkie. Meanwhile, all of the actors who were calling in remotely would be on Zoom in the background so they could hear everything going on and communicate in real time. In moments where more personal or intimate notes were required, Fuqua and Gyllenhaal would hop on FaceTime to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T4Nsn"&gt;The closest the actor and director ever got to face-to-face communication was, well, a little unorthodox. “When we were in a setup change — a lighting change that would take more than 20 minutes or something — I’d go outside and I’d climb this ladder that was on the wall, and Antoine would open the door to his van, and like Romeo and Juliet we would talk from afar; me on the top of this wall on a ladder and him on the street,” says Gyllenhaal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2mZoDZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It leaves less room for something feeling alive.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGKt0w"&gt;Beyond the logistical challenges, all of these different ways of communicating — in particular Zoom — had an impact on the actual performances. “We were a slave to a particular technology, which was Zoom,” Gyllenhaal explains. “And that creates a rhythm. Even in our introductions, we would come on, and you don’t want to interrupt someone. That’s the essence of acting: rhythm. When your rhythm is dictated to you by a technological thing, it leaves less room for something feeling alive. And we had to navigate that for the first four or five days. It was like someone took a quarter of a second out of my instinct. And if you’re a professional at whatever you do, acting in particular, rhythm is everything. Ask a quarterback, you take a quarter of a second away from their throw, that means the difference between missing or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuJWDB"&gt;Midway through &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a seemingly minor location change, when Gyllenhaal’s character moves from a busy office full of other dispatchers to an empty room across the hall so he could be alone. From the viewer’s perspective, the change doesn’t seem like a big deal. It’s just a man walking from one desk to another. But given all of the restrictions on set, the shift in location made a huge difference for the actors and production team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sXg3lR7b0jZpROlkxAr0SmZcapU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870501/Guilty_20201121_2642_R.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N7uLvb"&gt;“We were all racing towards that small room,” says Gyllenhaal. “We were all desperate to get the character in that small room where he was alone because it meant we could move away from having everyone together in a big room with extras moving about. It was almost like, can we get through the first two days safe, and then we don’t have everyone interacting as much. We have people in the background through glass walls. I remember that very specifically. Let’s get through those first two days and we can feel a little safer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnmlda"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Let’s get through those first two days and we can feel a little safer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sh1DR3"&gt;(One of the few silver linings was that it was relatively easy to get other actors on board. “Everyone was at home and everyone wanted to work,” says Gyllenhaal. “So we made all of these phone calls and got incredible actors.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSc0FR"&gt;For the most part, these COVID-related challenges aren’t noticeable in the final product, aside from the fact that no one ever seems to get close to each other, even in such close quarters. &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly tense despite the fact that you’re mostly just watching a man talk on the phone. Part of that has to do with the story, which goes in all sorts of wild, often uncomfortable, directions. But it also comes down to Gyllenhaal’s performance. For him, one of the biggest obstacles in this role was something that a lot of us have had to deal with during the pandemic. “I did have a hard time sitting still,” he says. “It’s hard to create intensity, to generate energy, after 10 hours of sitting in a chair listening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXkRME"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Guilty &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is coming to select theaters on September 24th and will stream on Netflix on October 1st.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I wish Microsoft made an Xbox or Surface gaming laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRiPlDNiiZYsygMeB2MxrPFk2zo=/0x96:2276x1613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897565/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Gaming.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOIk3U"&gt;I’ve been waiting years for Microsoft to make a gaming laptop, and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt; still misses the mark. Whether it would be an Xbox laptop or a Surface one, Microsoft has never really come close to building something truly designed for gaming on the go. The Surface Book, Surface Pro, and Surface Laptop all serve different creator types, but none really cater to gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpvPgR"&gt;It feels like a missed opportunity, particularly when Microsoft calls Windows 11 “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fKjd_pmQpQM"&gt;the best Windows ever for gaming&lt;/a&gt;,” and the market for gaming laptops has become increasingly lucrative in recent years. Barely a month goes by without a thin and cool gaming laptop being announced, and the line separating laptops from gaming laptops is increasingly blurring thanks to advances in chip designs and cooling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oDlJO"&gt;Microsoft has never marketed the Surface Book as a gaming laptop, but the Surface Laptop Studio comes as close as Microsoft has ever come to embracing PC gaming on a Surface. “Elevate your PC gaming,” says Microsoft on its Surface Laptop Studio product page, adding that the device allows you to “play the latest games with graphics that rival reality.” Microsoft also markets the device with people playing Xbox Game Pass for PC games on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIN7WADgz9-tbwyuXTEFMuR95fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871773/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Gaming_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft markets the Surface Laptop Studio for gaming on the go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fUHPni"&gt;I was hoping the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, a successor to the Surface Book, might capitalize on the interest in gaming laptops. Unfortunately, Microsoft has picked one of the weakest Nvidia GPUs available right now, the RTX 3050 Ti. It can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price"&gt;deliver 60fps gameplay&lt;/a&gt; in some modern games at 1080p, but it won’t come close to hitting the 120fps needed to make use of the 120Hz panel without seriously knocking game settings down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2HTpn"&gt;I wish Microsoft had gone a step further and added options for an RTX 3070 or RTX 3080. The Surface Laptop Studio supports up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB SSD storage, and it ships with Intel’s 11th Gen Core H processors, so it’s more than capable of gaming with the right GPU. It even has Thunderbolt 4 support, so you could buy an eGPU and attach it for gaming, but you shouldn’t really &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to do that to get the best performance on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peomlg"&gt;Microsoft has come close to putting a good GPU inside the Surface Book for years, but the company has always shied away from going full gaming laptop. First there was the Surface Book with its GeForce 940M, then the Surface Book with a Performance Base that upgraded the GPU to a GeForce 965M. Neither were suitable for gaming, but the Surface Book 2 delivered a GTX 1060 on the 15-inch version, which was capable of running a variety of games if you were willing to turn the settings down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDRBDtfHNKZep3_AN9z1jaidTzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003705/twarren_200522_4035_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Book has always come close to embracing PC gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rY7zpM"&gt;The Surface Book 2 was never really designed for gaming, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658466/microsoft-surface-book-2-review"&gt;During my review&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed performance issues due to throttling and problems with the power supply keeping the device fully charged. Microsoft moved to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271735/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-15-inch-screen-size-specs-features-price"&gt;GTX 1660Ti Max-Q on the Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt; and addressed the charging issues, but there were still issues around the dGPU disconnecting randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aR0Md"&gt;Microsoft has always struggled to really embrace the PC gaming platform in general, though. While most people use Windows for PC games, it’s Valve’s Steam that they interact with, not the Microsoft Store or Microsoft’s Xbox apps. Microsoft’s many PC gaming failures (let’s not mention Games for Windows Live) have contributed to a lack of focus, and the company’s UWP experiment for Xbox Game Studios titles has just been a headache for installs, updates, and even during gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl5AFD"&gt;So it’s really no surprise Microsoft is hesitant to embrace the PC gaming with its own hardware, even if it does some great DirectX work in the background to improve PC game performance and underlying APIs for developers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV0NwZlhNDLFkL4tveBBROKygM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871772/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Internals_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Surface Laptop Studio only has an RTX 3050 Ti inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9t2gwq"&gt;PC gaming is now in a moment of transformation for gaming on the go. There have been a few options for Nintendo Switch-like devices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; has thrust the idea into the mainstream. The miniature PC is powered by Linux and, if successful, it could help break the reliance on Windows for PC gaming. Perhaps Microsoft’s even thinking about its own Xbox handheld, as the AMD components Valve is using inside the Steam Deck are also available for competitors to make their own mobile gaming PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa43VO"&gt;Either way, I just wish Microsoft would take PC gaming more seriously both within Windows and with its Xbox / Surface hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;Gaming laptops are no longer bulky and garish&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d love to see what Microsoft could produce if it truly focused on PC gaming on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is betting big on a world’s worth of children’s stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WypbZ2HwPJBsvw6RjDK0sl_cfhs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897452/RD_NETFLIX_LH_V009__0_00_07_21_20181127_5885_fizs41.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrIJ0B"&gt;Streaming’s reigning king announced one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686472/netflix-rumor-roald-dahl-willy-wonka-bfg-matilda"&gt;biggest title acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; to date this week with its purchase of the rights to Roald Dahl’s catalog of work. The deal, following regulatory approval, will give Netflix access to a universe of beloved children’s stories to mine and position the company to better compete with kid-friendly competitors like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbBr7z"&gt;The acquisition of the trove of intellectual property follows a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflixs-roald-dahl-deal-could-create-tv-universe-1164419/"&gt;previous partnership&lt;/a&gt; between Netflix and the Roald Dahl Story Company announced in 2018 to adapt some of the late author’s iconic titles. With access to the full library of Dahl stories — which include children’s classics like &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;James and the Giant Peach&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The BFG&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Matilda&lt;/em&gt;, among others — Netflix has the opportunity to build an entire world from the catalog, boosting its originals draw and keeping kids and parents hooked on its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbUpeY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix has previously said it plans to invest in its children’s content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tPOQFz"&gt;The deal is arguably one of the most significant acquisitions Netflix has made in its programming in recent memory, and it speaks to the importance of kids’ content for the service’s continued growth. The company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963816/spongebob-squarepants-spinoff-netflix-nickelodeon-deal-disney-streaming"&gt;huge deal with Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt; for original animated films and series in 2019, a year after the original Dahl partnership was announced, and it recently &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/netflix-orders-3-seasons-cocomelon-lane-animated-preschool-series-specials-little-baby-bum-1234791577/"&gt;ordered three seasons&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;Cocomelon&lt;/em&gt; spinoff, after initially bringing the YouTube-hit kids’ series to its service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJonPn"&gt;Netflix has also pointed toward &lt;em&gt;The Willoughbys&lt;/em&gt;, a 2020 animated comedy the service said reached nearly 38 million households in its first four weeks, as “an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster our offering for kids and families.” With Dahl’s library, Netflix may very well be making its biggest bet yet in furthering that goal. (Netflix didn’t specify how much it paid for the catalog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MixeQu"&gt;Netflix is competing in a space that’s becoming more crowded by the day. Its obvious primary competitor for children’s streaming, Disney Plus, zoomed past the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;100 million subscriptions mark&lt;/a&gt; by first quarter of 2021. Meanwhile, HBO Max (which has the DC catalog under its umbrella, among other properties) and Apple TV Plus (which has &lt;em&gt;Peanuts &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;-adjacent properties) have also focused their sights on children’s programming. That’s to say nothing of the series and films for kids available as free-to-stream titles on other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jigJU7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix will develop “a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tho4Fa"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-acquires-iconic-roald-dahl-story-company"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about this week’s acquisition, Netflix said its existing partnership with the Dahl organization “opened our eyes to a much more ambitious venture — the creation of a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre, consumer products and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koNnRj"&gt;The “more” in Netflix’s statement certainly speaks to the company’s indication that it’s interested in continuing to build out franchises and fan communities, most recently with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;big bet on gaming&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other streamers that have primarily focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;acquiring legacy studios&lt;/a&gt; for mountains of money as a means of swooping up valuable IP, Netflix has been far more conservative about its investments — underscoring how valuable Netflix sees the Dahl IP as being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXRJUT"&gt;“The industry has consolidated materially over the years […] and we don’t believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if at all,” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt; mere months ago in July. “While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as ‘must-have’ and we haven’t yet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wH6DjU"&gt;There’s no doubt that Netflix cut a very sizable check for Dahl’s books, with which Netflix may even be able to expand beyond children’s stories if reimagined for older audiences. But even as Netflix sidesteps the studio bidding wars, it’s proven that it is willing to pay handsomely when the opportunity — in this case, a world’s worth of children’s stories — is right.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get Teams to go away in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8zrWa_4Rk-wfa6ZoAqmwtxDErDs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897347/Screenshot__24___1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PFOKGy"&gt;When you first install Windows 11, you will probably see a new icon on your Taskbar — or, at least, it will be new if you haven’t been using Microsoft’s Teams collaboration app lately. If you float your cursor across the icon, which looks like a camera inside of a cartoon speech balloon, it will say “Chat.” Click on it, and you’ll be invited to “Meet and chat with friends and family” using Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkmMhu"&gt;If you’re already using Teams, or you’re okay with switching to it, you’re fine. After that, when you click on the Chat icon, you’ll be able to chat with friends, family, and colleagues using a pop-up box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKcSXr"&gt;So what if you’re not interested in using Microsoft Teams? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TrUE8"&gt;There are several things you can do if you find the push to Teams irritating. You can stop Teams from automatically loading every time you start your machine. You can remove the Chat icon from the Taskbar. And, if you really want to go the whole hog, you can uninstall it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSYVJm"&gt;Let’s take these one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PAnQuc"&gt;Stop Teams from loading on startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nDkYiP"&gt;It’s really simple to simply stop Teams — or any other app that you don’t need — from loading when your machine starts up. This not only gets your machine to start up faster, but it reserves your PC’s memory for the stuff you really want to use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MekomO"&gt;Open the Settings app. There are several methods: you can click on your Start icon and select Settings from the pinned menu; or right-click the Start icon and select Settings; or type “Windows + i” on the keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kpfnai"&gt;Select Apps &amp;gt; Startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S4UVmn"&gt;Scroll down to “Microsoft Teams” and toggle it off. (The app may say “Microsoft Teams (Preview)” instead.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle Teams off so it won’t automatically startup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RH3j-EbviIzGtl72Wq2XT6tjFOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869711/Screenshot__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle Teams off so it won’t automatically start up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mSTui7"&gt;By the way, as long as you’re in the Startup menu, take a look at some of the other apps that automatically start up with your computer; there may be some others that you want to disable (for example, what if you don’t necessarily want to run OneDrive?). Go ahead and do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3Uhoae"&gt;Remove Teams from your Taskbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RGDwU8"&gt;Even if you stop Teams from loading, you’re still going to have the Teams Chat icon sitting in your Taskbar. If you have no intention of using it and want to save your Taskbar for other apps, it’s simple to remove it, though it’s not quite the same process as most of the other apps that are pinned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PKmNER"&gt;Right-click on the Taskbar and then click on “Taskbar settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iC0XXm"&gt;Under Taskbar items, toggle off “Chat”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can easily remove Teams from your Taskbar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwq3u7dDr_PQjY3W-Q972mCkq-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869747/Screenshot__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can easily remove Teams from your Taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MrIYPf"&gt;Uninstall Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc2hLQ"&gt;If you really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don’t want Teams around, you can uninstall it. There are actually two ways of doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zXzbWs"&gt;Using the Start menu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CJhYht"&gt;Click on the Start menu icon in the Taskbar and then on the “All apps” button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UWwFPk"&gt;Scroll down to the Microsoft Teams app or type “Teams” in the search box. (The app may say “Microsoft Teams (Preview)” instead.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKsbwW"&gt;Right-click on the app and choose “Uninstall.” You’ll be told that the app will be uninstalled, so click “Uninstall” again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can uninstall apps directly from your Start menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQgivh68XgsicUO2_k3NEjcNprc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869964/Screenshot__33_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can uninstall apps directly from your Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mrIoL8"&gt;Using Settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U2LUQV"&gt;Open the Settings app (see above for various ways to do this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="30PRwf"&gt;Select Apps from the left-hand menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4pTGrb"&gt;Select “Apps &amp;amp; Features”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="axtip9"&gt;Find the Microsoft Teams app, either by scrolling down or typing “Teams” into the search box. (It may say “Microsoft Teams (Preview).”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zijtlL"&gt;Click on the three dots to the right of the app’s name and select “Uninstall.” You’ll be told that the app will be uninstalled, so click “Uninstall” again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also uninstall apps by going to Setup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9fwUzigWIenkUuQ2By7F810lP-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869990/Screenshot__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also uninstall apps by going to Setup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ziH428"&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai and Motional expand their footprint in Las Vegas ahead of robotaxi launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Jzhcym36Ms2H6ZRGMBLfM7xK8g=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897340/04._Priority_image.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wlVs2b"&gt;Motional, the autonomous vehicle company that is a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, is growing its presence in Las Vegas as it gears up to launch a commercial robotaxi service in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0v75i"&gt;The company is tripling the size of its closed-course testing facility, doubling its operations center, and hiring over 100 new employees. The larger testing facility will allow for “four times” the volume of testing, including new “high-stress situations,” such as high speeds, complex urban maneuvers, different lighting conditions, and light to heavy rain — all of which have been known to flummox autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w6Ps7u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The vehicle that will be put through this new, rigorous battery of tests will be the Hyundai Ioniq 5&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6l5zu"&gt;The vehicle that will be put through this new, rigorous battery of tests will be the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which Motional has said will be the primary vehicle for its robotaxi fleet. The company recently unveiled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648789/motional-hyundai-ioniq5-robotaxi-lyft-photos"&gt;first images of the Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt; with rooftop lidar sensors and other equipment that will allow it to operate autonomously. The company will also increase the size of its test fleet as it expands its testing capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQpWun"&gt;All of this is to prepare Motional’s AV software for the launch of a commercial robotaxi service in 2023. The service, which is likely to kick off in Las Vegas, will be available on Lyft’s ride-hailing app, after that company sold off its own AV technology development program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;to Toyota for $550 million last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnSMyi"&gt;Motional as a joint venture was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-autonomous-aptiv/hyundai-motor-group-aptiv-to-set-up-4-billion-self-driving-car-venture-idUSKBN1W80WP"&gt;first announced in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when Hyundai said it would spend $1.6 billion on developing a commercial business around autonomous vehicles. Aptiv, a technology company formerly known as Delphi, owns 50 percent of the venture. The company currently has facilities in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Seoul and has also tested its vehicles in Boston and Pittsburgh. In addition to Las Vegas, Motional is also testing its vehicles in Santa Monica, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDMqaU"&gt;Motional’s engineers were responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637822/self-driving-taxi-first-public-trial-singapore-nutonomy"&gt;the world’s first robotaxi pilot in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the first cross-country &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/driverless-car-road-trip-san-francisco-new-york-city/568939/"&gt;New York to San Francisco autonomous trip&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last several years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Aptiv’s — and now Motional’s — fleet of safety driver-monitored autonomous taxis in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; (in partnership with Lyft) have completed “over 100,000 trips.” Earlier this year, the company began testing vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291682/motional-fully-driverless-autonomous-cars-las-vegas"&gt;without a human monitor behind the steering wheel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaUyDB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japanese Breakfast on composing Sable’s sprawling ambient soundtrack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2021 Railbird Festival" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwQz82CqdJuqiSh37QxpUidzbLI=/12x0:6048x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897128/1336993783.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stephen J. Cohen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsiKB3"&gt;This week marks the release of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, a beautiful indie title that looks like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; mixed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17462494/sable-xbox-preview-moebius-zelda-e3-2018"&gt;a comic from Jean “Moebius” Giraud&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not just the game’s art that’s striking, though; the whole experience is accompanied by an excellent original soundtrack composed by Michelle Zauner, the frontwoman for the indie rock band Japanese Breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKncCK"&gt;Ahead of &lt;em&gt;Sable’s&lt;/em&gt; launch on Thursday and the release of the official soundtrack on Friday, I got the opportunity to talk to Zauner about composing the music for the game. It has a completely different sound than what you might be used to from her other work, so I wanted to know what it was like to make the music and where she got her inspiration. There was a lot to talk about, including glow worms, pop music, a humongous Spotify playlist, and the &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I09MOI"&gt;Read on for the full conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWbLtd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: How did you get involved with the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDAhjX"&gt;Michelle Zauner: I believe in 2017, Daniel Fineberg, one of the developers, reached out to me on Twitter in a DM. I had just released my second album, “Soft Sounds From Another Planet,” and to help promote it, me and this woman named Elaine Fath worked on developing a mini-RPG game called &lt;a href="http://japanesebreakfast.rocks/BreakQuest/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japanese BreakQuest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that had mini versions of all of the songs from the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg4qzu"&gt;Daniel and Greg [Kythreotis], the developers of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, really wanted to work with a composer that was outside of the gaming world and could offer a kind of something new to the world that they were building. I think Daniel was a fan of Japanese Breakfast, and, seeing that I was interested in games and enjoyed them, thought that I would be a good fit. I had only seen the GIFs of the art at that time because that was all that was really there. And I loved it and just knew I wanted to be involved right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx7YRN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the process of actually working on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? I’m curious about how you collaborated with the developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzu4EL"&gt;I don’t know if it’s normal or not, but I think that I was brought in very early. I was just so excited to be a part of it. I had just finished my second album and I was on the hunt for new projects, and so I started working on music really early on before I had even seen much of the game. At the time, there was just a large Word doc of what they were trying for and what the different biomes were going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWWt7r"&gt;On tour, I was writing a lot with plugins on the computer, [thinking about] what, like, a glow worm cave would look like, based on a description. And then, in 2019, more of the game and more of the narrative started coming together. I would see sort of videos of the different areas and realize whether or not the music that I had composed earlier fit better in different sections, and so I just continued to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IPZgT3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In 2020, I would say I spent a majority of my lockdown playing the updated builds of the game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xykhWF"&gt;In 2020, I would say I spent a majority of my lockdown playing the updated builds of the game. That’s when the real concentrated work started happening; playing the updated builds every week and finding where we could put music in ways that can uplift certain sections, where to place the songs, and how to integrate the music with the sound designer, Martin Wallace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kczD8h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the developers change anything based on the music you created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WdNBR"&gt;Yeah, I do think so. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej5-CHAGr34"&gt;“Glider”&lt;/a&gt; pretty early on in the process before the narrative was really shored up. I had maybe 10 key words of what I knew [the developers] were going for that I was working off of to incorporate lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIeRMo"&gt;We all knew really early on that we were going to have a major moment in the game where you leave the main area and there’s this theme that plays. When you leave your village, [the developers] were inspired by the&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXGW6sWYDY"&gt; Jose Gonzalez composition in &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; there being this long moment where you get a song that has vocals in it that paints the mood and the feeling of what it’s like to leave your hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sy01e6"&gt;I knew that that was going to be a big moment, and I wanted to tackle that problem pretty early. I think some of the lyrical content and some of the structure of that song helped inform some of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVL3rS"&gt;I also wrote the end theme before there was a cutscene at the end, and they were able to cut and edit to that. And I think that as they were coloring certain worlds, they were able to listen to music I had pitched and hopefully be inspired by that in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kB8rHr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZ_wSTQtVoU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="auCLi7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was composing for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; different than for Japanese Breakfast or writing your own music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ucAR0"&gt;Super different in two major ways. One is that Japanese Breakfast essentially is like a pop project. There’s a real structure in pop music with repeating choruses, and you’re constantly trying to create an earworm and get a hook out as quickly as possible. Whereas in these ambient instrumental pieces [in &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;] in which you’re traversing an open world, you really need them to not become grating. The sprawling ambient loops are a very new type of writing that I had to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxEkOU"&gt;Lyrically, [&lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;] was very different. So much of my work in Japanese Breakfast is very personal and rooted in specific details of my life, while &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; has nothing to do with me. I had to write lyrics that were very broad and universal and touch on what it’s like to come of age or be uncertain about your future. It was really fun to learn that I don’t have to excavate my own personal trauma in order to write compelling music; I can write these themes that can apply to anyone and they can be moving in a unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqxWJK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’ll take any of what you learned working on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to your next album?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQgiok"&gt;Yeah, absolutely. I think that “Better the Mask” [which you can hear part of&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fojy_YRseGk"&gt; in this trailer&lt;/a&gt;] may be the best song I’ve ever written. I’m most proud of my work on that song. I’ve become a lot more competent at arranging strings and piano for the first time. I’ve grown so much as a producer on this project, as the sole producer on the project, and I definitely will apply a lot of those lessons for Japanese Breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0AMtK8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fojy_YRseGk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9lmj2V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I saw you had an amazing Spotify playlist with like 150 songs of inspiration [note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3IfOa8ezSw5loNhhYlrw0c?si=mYUCqYptTuWdNOeP3Oltsw&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it actually has 173 songs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;]. How did that come together and how did you use it while you were writing things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sRZt7"&gt;I was pretty new to ambient music and I really fell in love with it over the course of working on this project. I started collecting a Spotify playlist to make sure that Greg and Daniel and Martin and I were in conversation of what the vibe was going to be like and that nothing was off-putting to them and because I ultimately felt like I was contributing to their world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzCCY4"&gt;I haven’t been the creative director on the project. I’m just a contributor. I think that [the playlist] was a really wonderful way to share my inspiration and talk to Greg and Daniel about what kind of music they were inspired by and thought of when creating these different spaces. [The playlist] was a really fun thing to toss back and forth and use as a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCH6wX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What games were you inspired by, if any?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NShg7e"&gt;The first video game I played as a kid that made me realize that video games were a real art form was this game called &lt;em&gt;Secret of Mana&lt;/em&gt; for SNES. It’s an RPG game that I played with my father. I love the soundtrack to that game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAlF0W"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack was a really important one. I really love the &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack, and particularly the variations of themes they have for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDqt9Z7K1Lo"&gt;another world&lt;/a&gt;. I thought about those a lot when working on the day and nighttime variations for the different biomes [in &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;]. And I like all of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games, which have such incredible soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ERUQm"&gt;I know that Greg referenced &lt;em&gt;Majora’s Mask&lt;/em&gt; a lot because there’s this haunting, strange quality that Koji Kondo has that we wanted to bring out for the Mask Caster or certain areas of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQtwc0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’d work on any more games in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eeHgp"&gt;I hope that this is a good resume addition to showcase my breadth as a composer. Hopefully another really mesmerizing project like this will enter my life someday in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8dXqQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of project would be most interesting to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTIVxk"&gt;I don’t know. &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; was such a perfect project for me to be a part of. It was a real joy and honor to get to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lINZb7"&gt;It would be fun to work on some kind of platformer that was less ambient and more obnoxious with an in-your-face kind of theme. If I could do more songs like the “Chum Lair” song on the soundtrack, I think that would be a fun new area to flex for me. And it’s very different from &lt;em&gt;Sable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
