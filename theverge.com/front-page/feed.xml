    <title>Luigi is joining Lego’s interactive Mario sets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-b2Qk8dXPHkAUHgUgf0XQRRttCs=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154934/oWpI9vyg.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="te1MJl"&gt;Luigi — everyone’s favorite also-ran brother of the most famous mushroom-stomping plumber — is joining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;Lego’s interactive Super Mario collection of sets&lt;/a&gt; in a new starter kit (creatively titled the LEGO Super Mario Adventures with Luigi Starter Course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE4UVv"&gt;The new Luigi figure is technologically similar to the Mario one, with a built-in display that animates his eyes, mouth, and a main screen on his chest and a sensor on the bottom that’s used to scan barcodes and brick colors. The main differences are cosmetic here — Luigi looks different, and features different sound effects, voice lines, and character interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Fp0Du"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tao6Nnwwa5w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="vDBs0e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Lego’s Mario sets bring the magic of Nintendo to life","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TnNj95"&gt;In addition to Lego Luigi, the new starter course also includes a Pink Yoshi, a Bone Goomba, and &lt;a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Boom_Boom"&gt;Boom Boom&lt;/a&gt; for players to defeat — or add to their larger Lego Super Mario creations. The new Luigi character is also compatible with all the previous sets, should players want to explore their old courses from a fresh perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFZGiN"&gt;The Luigi Starter course is set to launch on August 1st for $59.99, the same price as the Mario Starter course set. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fadventures-with-luigi-starter-course-71387%3Ficmp%3DLP-SHH-Tall-Mario_Hero_Tall_Luigi-TH-NO-CL7IET0VZ1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393486%2Fluigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Preorders are available now&lt;/a&gt; from the Lego website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is opening a hair salon in London to trial new technology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJdxPZeWYJ15qz1WO4UATeO5m5g=/0x45:812x586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154932/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91DqhW"&gt;Amazon’s latest bricks-and-mortar experiment is, unexpectedly, a hair salon. The company is opening its &lt;a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/shopping-and-entertainment/introducing-amazon-salon"&gt;Amazon Salon&lt;/a&gt; in London’s East End Spitalfields area, where it says it will trial “the latest industry technology.” This includes an augmented reality app that lets customers see what different hair styles and colors look like on them before they decide on a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8uDqZ"&gt;Unlike the company’s cashierless Go grocery stores (which expanded to London &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312970/amazon-fresh-cashier-less-store-uk-go-grocery-london"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;), Amazon Salon does not seem to be a beachhead for an industry invasion. “This will be an experiential venue where we showcase new products and technology, and there are no current plans to open any other Amazon Salon locations,” said the company in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDgIIT"&gt;Instead, it looks more like a modest marketing stunt meant to signal the company’s ambitions in the fashion and beauty sectors generally. These have been sectors where Amazon has struggled to make in-roads against specialist stores. The arrival of the Amazon Salon in London follows the company’s launch of its &lt;a href="https://business.amazon.co.uk/en/find-solutions/simplify-buying/selection/pro-beauty"&gt;Amazon Professional Beauty Store&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, an online storefront that sells wholesale spa and salon products to businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wGRI5K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10455952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6MnWY"&gt;Amazon Salon will occupy more than 1,500 square feet of space across two floors at a location in Brushfield Street. As well as playing around with AR haircut apps (and getting an actual haircut), visitors will be able to test new “point-and-learn” technology” which allows them to “simply point at the product they are interested in on a display shelf” to bring up more information and purchasing options on a nearby display. That includes QR codes to buy specific items. It sounds pretty underwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XBvNn"&gt;Anyone wanting to get an Amazon-brand trim will have to wait, though. The Amazon Salon will initially only be open to Amazon employees with the &lt;em&gt;hoi polloi&lt;/em&gt; allowed entry some time “in the coming weeks.” When you go, be sure to ask for the Jeff Bezos “slaphead special.” We hear it’s very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony launches ‘Silent White’ WH-1000XM4 headphones because the black void of space is too loud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWh0VBSg9YDXgIYqXUFHaYuq7X0=/0x1:2393x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154914/WH_1000XM4_SilentWhite_Sub_B_gradation_low_for_wide_angle_8000x4262_Large.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bmdmt2"&gt;Picture the scene. It’s summer, lockdowns are easing, and you’re ready to venture back out into the world. You’re feeling brave after a year stuck inside, brave enough that you’ve picked out an all-white outfit. You read up on how to make the color work in the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.fr/fashion/article/fashion-trends-25-ways-to-wear-white-spring-summer-season"&gt;likes of &lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-wear-all-white-everything"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but suddenly, disaster strikes. You notice something. “&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;top rated wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt;!” you exclaim to no-one in particular, “they’re only available in black, &lt;a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x8gW79x-L._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;, or this &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/image/b46f52146929c0b90f207296acd5a224?fmt=png-alpha&amp;amp;wid=720"&gt;weird dork-ass beige&lt;/a&gt;?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vbEkQ"&gt;It’s ok, don’t fret. &lt;a href="https://presscentre.sony.eu/pressreleases/sony-launches-new-limited-edition-wh-1000xm4-silent-white-3091756"&gt;Sony is releasing a limited edition &lt;/a&gt;of the WH-1000XM4 headphones in all white. Better still, it’s real white, not that orthopedic brown Sony’s being trying to pass off as “silver” all these years. Sony promises these “Silent White” headphones will be “even more stain-resistant,” which will hopefully help keep them looking pristine for at least a little while. Unfortunately they’re limited edition, and will only be available while stock lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BG1Fpc1zfdxiSD8U0vjeM2nvz4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456595/WH_1000XM4_White_with_case2_Large.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MfLOGV"&gt;Internally these are the same as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;excellent WH-1000XM4 headphones&lt;/a&gt; the company released last year. That means you’re getting excellent audio quality, noise cancellation, and mic performance, and the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCWiqu"&gt;The white headphones will be available in Europe from May for €430/£400, but there’s no sign of the color on &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4"&gt;Sony’s US site&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing. We’ve contacted the company to ask about US availability.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now the iPad Pro has to live up to the MacBook Air</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ieBVdecSxfGIePzeEQUaafZbPbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154867/vpavic_042018_3979_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jyIXlW"&gt;Today, we’re expecting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;grab bag of new products from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, headlined by new iPad Pros. Given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;relatively minor spec bumps&lt;/a&gt; that we got on last year’s iPad Pros, this time around we’re hoping for a more substantial update. In some ways, it seems likely that Apple will deliver, at least with the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXIPct"&gt;I’m sure the specs will be impressive. But after the release of the first MacBooks with Apple’s own M1 ARM-based silicon, there’s a strange inversion happening. Before, we’d look at a MacBook and wonder why it can’t have the power and battery life of an iPad. Now, I think more and more people are going to join me in looking at the iPad and wondering why it can’t have the flexibility and power of a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTUUhc"&gt;In short, Apple’s silicon didn’t just catch the Mac up to the iPad, it catapulted the Mac beyond the iPad. The M1 MacBook Air is fast, responsive, has no fan, runs any Mac app I throw at it (including Intel apps) very quickly, and even can run some iPad apps (though that experiment isn’t going super well). It is easily the best general-purpose laptop I’ve used in half a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TMsmhs"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="M1 MacBook Pro and Air review: Apple delivers|96773" data-volume-uuid="6412f55d2" data-volume-id="96773" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-404" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6qESXR"&gt;That big of a leap can’t help but recast the iPad’s development over the years. As just one data point, I’ve used both iPad Pros and M1-based MacBooks as my daily work computer and the MacBook Air has better battery life. An iPad can last for days and days if you just use it for tablet tasks, but log in to all your stuff and run it all day like you do your laptop and it’ll conk out a few hours short of the MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofl5N7"&gt;From one perspective, I get that it’s silly to just one-to-one compare the iPad and Mac. The iPad is more flexible in its hardware: you can sit on the couch with it, you can use a stylus with it, attach a keyboard, and — get this — touch the screen. When I speak to Apple executives, they express little of the Mac vs iPad angst I see online (and feel myself). Nobody’s actually confused between these two devices, they argue, and I believe it. One of my core beliefs about consumer technology is that consumers are savvier and smarter than they usually get credit for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH5OBQ"&gt;That savvy cuts both ways, though. Because from the other perspective, everybody is capable of just looking at each computer’s capabilities and seeing that the Mac can just do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not quite true that the iPad’s functionality is merely a subset of the Mac’s, but in the Venn diagram of the two the iPad-only part of the circle isn’t very big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvAvdD"&gt;Another way of looking at it is this: it used to be that you would go for the iPad because the MacBook was just fundamentally worse at a few things like speed and battery life. Now that we have MacBooks with Apple Silicon, that list is significantly shorter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtA7L6"&gt;Can the iPad Pro jump back ahead through purely hardware specs? It’d be tough. According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost"&gt;Mark Gurman at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad Pro is supposed to get an “updated processor that is on par with the faster M1 chip in the latest MacBook Air.” There are significant differences between how Apple puts together iOS chips and MacBook chips, but let’s just assume it’s easy to compare and the iPad gets faster. So what? Apple has the enviable problem right now of having computers that are more than fast enough for the vast majority of people. I don’t know anybody who’s actually complaining about the iPad Pro’s speed or graphical capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiFoCg"&gt;New cameras? Sure. LIDAR? I remain unconvinced it’s a must-have feature for anybody. The one thing that might matter is the rumored fancy, new Mini LED screen technology on the larger iPad Pro. That will make it look more like a high-end TV, with brighter brights and blacker-blacks. One of the best things to do on an iPad is watch video, and so it might convince some people to upgrade just for the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcJI5p"&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;review of the M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, I called it a “triumph” and was seriously considering giving it a perfect score until I saw how dumpy the webcam still is. That’s one place where the iPad has a much better spec: the iPad Pro’s front facing camera is excellent. It’s also in the wrong place, on the side when you use it horizontally instead of on the top. That’s the iPad Pro in a microcosm: stupefyingly good hardware with some stupid limitations in how Apple expects it to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WdmW7j"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPadOS review: sounds like a computer to me|73038" data-volume-uuid="74dee35c2" data-volume-id="73038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-404" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xkDgAY"&gt;The story with the iPad — and especially the iPad Pro — since before Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18103515/ipad-pro-replace-your-computer-ad-apple"&gt;2018 “What’s a computer” TV ad&lt;/a&gt; has been the same. Can its iOS-based software be opened up and extended enough to allow both developers and users to get it to do the things they want. Apple made a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20898883/ipados-review-13-apple-features-multitasking-sidecar-browser-bugs-computer"&gt;huge step in that direction with iPadOS in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still a long way to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irArMx"&gt;Today’s iPad Pros are likely to be amazing feats of technology, but the really important iPad announcement will come this summer at WWDC, when Apple will unveil its plans for iPadOS. Right now I use the iPad Pro every day, but mostly as a Sidecar display for my MacBook. It’s just much more useful as a Mac screen than it is as an iPad screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvOPiu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoCIfv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venmo is adding support for users to buy, store, and sell cryptocurrency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_BALD5_nFLqjGNAq2Oafvi0gUU=/1x0:1840x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154747/Crypto_on_Venmo_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gfL0WM"&gt;Venmo is releasing a feature that will allow users the option to store, buy, and sell popular cryptocurrencies, PayPal announced on Tuesday. Similar to PayPal, Venmo will support four different cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. PayPal had said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527288/paypal-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-venmo-bitcoin"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; that Venmo would get support for cryptocurrencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmttZG"&gt;You can get started with as little as $1, and transactions are managed from the app. Venmo said in a press release that it will begin rolling out the feature to some users today, and tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it anticipates that “most customers” will have access to cryptocurrencies in the app by the end of May. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-KgL9q3m_iAUMs155lvTOQIiMGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455653/image001__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All cryptocurrency transactions will be managed directly from the Venmo app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uuSgt4"&gt;Venmo’s support for cryptocurrencies could encourage more people to invest in them. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F02%2F04%2Fpaypal-holdings-pypl-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcr%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22392274%2Fvenmo-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-hold-bitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PayPal reported in its Q4 earnings reporter that Venmo had 70 million users&lt;/a&gt;; given the app operates like a social network, users may find cryptocurrency more approachable if they can see their friends buying and selling right inside Venmo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyBbs2"&gt;Venmo is the latest payment app to offer support for cryptocurrency.

    <title>Samsung’s new wireless keyboard is designed for DeX</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rC91Ls71_EJu-Ihek4J_AFWOXLQ=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154735/levant_feature_enter_into_dex_for_productivity_421565506.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard features a DeX shortcut on the top right of the keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6RtvJ"&gt;Samsung has quietly announced a new wireless keyboard, the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/levant/mobile-accessories/samsung-smart-keyboard-trio-500-black-ej-b3400ubegww/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Keyboard Trio 500&lt;/a&gt;. According to a listing on Samsung’s store &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxJmb/status/1383730984495894532"&gt;spotted by Max Jambor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it’s a compact wireless keyboard with a very similar design to the likes of Apple’s Magic Keyboard, but with an interesting Samsung twist — a DeX shortcut to use the desktop-style interface on compatible Samsung devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFboC3"&gt;DeX has been around since launching on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15495036/samsung-dex-station-galaxy-s8-review-desktop-dock"&gt;Galaxy S8 back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and allows you to access select Samsung phone or tablet’s apps in a windowed-interface similar to a desktop computer. But despite receiving new features and updates with subsequent phone releases, it’s yet to become the true desktop replacement Samsung initially pitched it as. Giving it an eye-catching button probably won’t change that, but it could still work as a little advertisement to use the feature, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/4/24/21232655/netflix-button-tv-remotes-advertisement-marketing-streaming"&gt;Netflix’s ubiquitous TV remote buttons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExJA6ElX3bUioLLx5jmTK1KlxlU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456562/levant_feature_pair_multiple_devices___switch_with_a_click_421565518.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard can be paired with up to three devices, and switch between them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ecr1SX"&gt;Beyond DeX, the Smart Keyboard Trio 500 has a couple of other tricks up its sleeve. There are customizable shortcut buttons to open your commonly used apps (though this is only compatible with Samsung devices running One UI 3.1 from march 2021 or later). The keyboard can also be paired with up to three devices, and switch between them using shortcut keys. It draws power from AAA batteries, which suggests it’s not rechargeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCzPPo"&gt;Samsung hasn’t listed a price or release date on its page for the Smart Keyboard Trio 500, but with an Unpacked event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382512/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-april-28th-event-most-powerful-device-book-pro"&gt;coming up on April 28th&lt;/a&gt; we could get an official unveiling soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Companies can’t wait to accessorize your AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J2ZTc49Gt8WjTc69gYNRozL0yH4=/0x0:2538x1692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154691/s_l1600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBay listings show accessories to attach the trackers to a key chain.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/402768710040?mkevt=1&amp;amp;mkcid=1&amp;amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;amp;campid=5336804442&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;customid=73726X1523000X489fcde28fe469d4e72e66a74e5dbad1" target="_blank"&gt;ta9146 / eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vQ4THZ"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored AirTags trackers could launch alongside a wide array of third-party accessories, if retailer listings and leaked photos &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/third-party-airtags-accessories/"&gt;pulled together by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are accurate. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F402768710040&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F985731193%2Fleather-airtags-cover-airtags-cases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt; sellers, and even &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fankishi-Bluetooth-Tracker-Cover-Bluetooth-Finder-Case-for-Airtags%2F490638502&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, are already selling keychains to attach the trackers to a set of keys. Images of apparent silicone straps have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1384320511824437248"&gt;also leaked&lt;/a&gt;, showing how the trackers could be strapped to bigger items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxTkXP"&gt;After being rumored for over a year, Apple’s Tile-like trackers are widely expected to be officially announced later today at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;Spring Loaded event&lt;/a&gt;. Reports indicate the trackers themselves will be small discs equipped with Bluetooth and ultra-wideband radio chips, which users can track with Apple’s Find My app. At this point they’ve been leaked basically everywhere: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;iOS code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142249/apple-tags-iphone-kuo-location-tracking"&gt;analyst reports&lt;/a&gt;, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;support video&lt;/a&gt; from Apple.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xd8yq1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AirTags third-party accessories are already ready. &lt;a href="https://t.co/lvv1elJ6iY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lvv1elJ6iY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DuanRui (@duanrui1205) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1384320511824437248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HGDQC"&gt;While there’s no guarantee that these accessory manufacturers are working off official information supplied by Apple, these leaks give a good indication of how they plan on supporting the trackers once they’re official. They follow earlier leaks from January about AirTags accessories from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/accessory-makers-preparing-for-airtags-launch/"&gt;Nomad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/spigen-airtags-accessory-for-late-october-release/"&gt;Spigen sub-brand Cyrill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Iuf7"&gt;Apple’s approach to attaching AirTags to your personal belongings is different from Tile, its main competitor in the space. Tile produces trackers in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20901686/tile-tracker-mate-pro-slim-sticker-release-date-news-features"&gt;variety of different form-factors&lt;/a&gt; depending on what they’re designed to track, whether it’s a credit card shaped device for a wallet, or a tracker with a hole that’s designed to go on a keychain. In contrast, Apple seems to be producing just a single form-factor, and relying on accessories to attach it to your belongings. It’s an interesting difference that might make Apple’s trackers more versatile, albeit slightly worse tailored to some cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2JUZE"&gt;Apple’s Spring Loaded event is due to take place later today at 1pm ET, where the AirTags are expected to be announced alongside the company’s new iPad Pro lineup and more. You’ll be able to watch along live on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393404%2Fairtags-accessories-keychain-leaked-photos-listings-trackers-tile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Event website&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBYVNuky1M"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EPOS’ new $119 H3 wired gaming headset is basic, but comfortable</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Not the most affordable wired model, but it’s a solid choice&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="2mv4vU"&gt;The gaming audio company EPOS has debuted a new wired gaming headset called the H3. It’s not as exciting as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241197/epos-gtw-270-hybrid-truly-wireless-earbuds-usb-c-gaming-bluetooth"&gt;GTW 270 truly wireless earbuds for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and depending on your needs, its short list of features might not be worth &lt;a href="https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/gaming"&gt;its $119 price&lt;/a&gt;. But a few things stick out in the H3’s favor after spending a few days with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ujxlu"&gt;EPOS has a knack for using a rotating dial for volume controls on its headsets, and if you read my review of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft’s excellent Xbox Wireless Headset&lt;/a&gt;, you know I’m all about dials. On the outside of the H3’s right earcup, there’s a dial controlling the volume that’s easy to adjust with two fingers. Opposite that, on the left earcup, there’s an articulating boom microphone that can be muted when it’s in the up position. Any time it’s lowered, the mic will be on, unless you mute it on your device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BShUPq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10455187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JoZtS0"&gt;I also like that these have broad compatibility with consoles, mobile devices, and PC — not that they’re the first to do this. The H3 includes two swappable braided cables, one made for PC that extends from the headset and splits into a dedicated audio 3.5mm plug and a microphone plug (most desktops and some gaming laptops feature both of these ports). There’s also a cable that outputs to a single 3.5mm plug that can go into a phone, a controller, a PC, an Oculus Quest 2, or any other device you own with this kind of audio jack. I do wish that EPOS included a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter to broaden compatibility further for devices that lack a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS H3 gaming headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5SIT14rnGAaqK8h_gvT5k-lvAR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455586/eposh3volume.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EPOS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right side of the H3, you’ll find this volume knob.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XEGnIk"&gt;You don’t have to spend $119 on a wired gaming headset to get features like the ones I explained above, but the H3’s comfort and sound performance help to justify their price. The earcups fit snug around my head, but not too snug, and they have a wide range of motion (though they don’t swivel to lay flat on the chest.) The headband’s size adjustments snap into place and don’t move, even when I yank the headset off. The passive noise isolation of the ear cups is decent, partially because of the closed-back design, but its plush pads do a better-than-average job at keeping outside sounds out because the cups can be tilted to fit your head shape. I’m short on qualms about the build quality, though the earcups might not be as good a fit for people who have larger ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oisMiq"&gt;The H3 is a solid performer when it comes to gaming and listening to music. Its closed-back earcups provide a clear, balanced sound without an overwhelming amount of bass. Yet, the palpable bass line in “&lt;em&gt;Book of Slim&lt;/em&gt;” by Gene Harris &amp;amp; The Three Sounds came through just fine. Switching over to games, I was happy with how games like &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank (2016)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; sounded on the H3 while connected to a PS5 controller. The sound quality rivals many of the sub-$150 headsets I’ve tried in my gaming headset buying guide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS H3 gaming headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNWBy4WEPCnP3Wr9Qjb9ZBb1vdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455569/eposh3text.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EPOS&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mic is muted when it’s flipped up, as it is in the picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zbWdoo"&gt;The microphone quality is also solid for the price, picking up all of the little details in my voice. It’s easy to tell my “p’s” from the “t’s” in voice recordings. It sounded crisp when connected to my PC, and within Google’s Recorder app while plugged into my Pixel 3 via a USB-C dongle. I got similarly good results plugged into my PS5 controller. Though, I wouldn’t suggest this headset over a dedicated microphone, if you’re planning on making any podcast appearances soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WimWAS"&gt;Other than the USB-C adapter that I wish was included, the other big omission from the H3 compared to other headsets in its price range is the lack of microphone monitoring. I love being able to hear my own voice, but I swear I’m not a narcissist. Monitoring is useful to hear someone yelling for you across the room when you’re distracted in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZBjtQ"&gt;If you aren’t totally sold on going wireless for your gaming headset because you don’t want another device to recharge, or some other reason, the H3 is a solid alternative. Its sound quality and comfort mostly make up for not having many features. That said, its price borders on what you’ll pay for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;one of several good wireless gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt; that have many more features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VanMoof’s PowerBank is a range extender and problem solver</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBeagqR-mH1S0rkF-dNuij3LVL4=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154571/IMG_6371.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VanMoof S3 with PowerBank arriving at Castricum aan Zee from Amsterdam.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We put a new 2021 S3 model to the test on a three-hour ride&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JbfiF9"&gt;VanMoof, maker of some of our favorite pedal-assisted electric bikes, just announced the PowerBank, a range extender that also charges the internal battery of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;X3 models&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does the emotional-support battery promise to ease range anxiety by extending VanMoof e-bike commutes by a claimed 45 to 100 km (28 to 62 miles), it also addresses VanMoof’s biggest limitation: non-removable batteries that enable a sleek look, but could necessitate hauling the 19-kg (42-pound) bikes indoors to be charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqwqkr"&gt;I’ve had a new VanMoof S3, improved for 2021 (more on that later), with the PowerBank since Friday. After 3 hours in the saddle on two 90-minute rides, I can attest to the extended range and more convenient charging. It’s not cheap and it’s not perfect and I didn’t go quite as far as VanMoof claims, but the PowerBank makes a compelling case for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGtIVa"&gt;The 378Wh capacity PowerBank attaches in seconds (about 20 of them). It has an on / off button so you can choose when it charges the larger 504Wh battery found inside both the full-sized S3 and smaller X3 e-bikes. It charges from a standstill or while riding, and adds an extra 2.8 kg (6.2 pounds) to the total weight of the bike. That’s a reasonable (and unnoticeable) tradeoff if it means never having to carry the bike up the stairs to your apartment again. It also adds &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/electric-bikes/powerbank"&gt;$348&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-NL/electric-bikes/powerbank"&gt;€348&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/shop/en_gb/accessories/vanmoof-powerbank"&gt;£315&lt;/a&gt; to the cost of a bike that already starts at $1,998 / €1,998 / £1,798, when the PowerBank starts shipping in June (preorders start today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMwhAS"&gt;The PowerBank sits in a permanent mount you must first attach to the S3 or X3 e-bikes. The PowerBank battery then wedges into the frame and locks in place with a supplied key, and is further secured with two velcro straps. A third velcro strap is used to keep the charging cable from flopping around as it snakes up to the underside of the top tube and into the bike’s charging port. I rode on some rather bumpy brick roads and didn’t hear a single rattle from the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9Nfr"&gt;The thick velcro straps, while being inelegant, blend nicely into the dark black S3 model. But the straps and bulky battery are visually jarring on the smaller, light blue X3 e-bike. The PowerBank is not compatible with earlier VanMoof e-bikes like the S2 or X2.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light blue VanMoof X3 fitted with a PowerBank. Eww.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t9uMvF"&gt;While a first for VanMoof, range extenders are not uncommon amongst e-bike makers, especially for electric mountain bikes. Last month Specialized announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360180/specialized-como-sl-ebike-review-price-specs"&gt;Como SL commuter e-bike&lt;/a&gt; with an optional $449.99 range extender that it says adds about 31 miles (55 km) of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyDCor"&gt;Over the weekend I tested a PowerBank fitted to a brand new VanMoof S3 on a 76.7 km (47.7 miles) round trip from Amsterdam to the coastal hamlet of Castricum aan Zee, and back. That’s beyond the 60 km stated range of a VanMoof ridden at max power, and far beyond the 47 km I managed during my S3 range test in April of 2020. VanMoof claims that a fully charged S3 battery coupled to a PowerBank has a range of between 105-250 km (65-155 miles), depending upon the level of powered assist you’re using. I wasn’t anywhere close to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gQjNfB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extended my range by about 70 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q7od9g"&gt;I rode at full power (level 4) on exceedingly flat Dutch terrain making liberal use of the Turbo Boost button. A bit more than half of my testing was directly into a fairly strong 14-knot headwind, the rest benefited from a 6-knot tailwind. In total, I’d estimate that I could have ridden about 80 km (50 miles) before both the S3 and PowerBank batteries were empty. In other words, the VanMoof PowerBank coupled to the new S3 extended my range by about 70 percent compared to 47 km (29.2 miles) I managed last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S09mBV"&gt;In my testing, I noticed that the S3 battery emptied faster than the PowerBank could recharge it while riding at max power with lots of Turbo Boost button presses. (VanMoof confirmed this behavior after my testing was complete.) So rather than risk having to stop and recharge on the way home (or ride in a less fun economy mode), I took advantage of a 20-minute ferry wait to top off the S3 battery when it was showing just 15 percent remaining. I likely would have made it the final 7.9 km home even without the top-up, but the whole point of having a PowerBank is to avoid range anxiety and I was in a hurry to get back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYKBpb"&gt;As to my buttocks, well, I should give the VanMoof’s custom saddle honorable mention. It’s surprisingly comfortable, and the first time I’ve ridden it — my S3 review bike was fitted with a different saddle last year. While I did notice a bit of discomfort &lt;em&gt;down there &lt;/em&gt;when climbing onto the bike for my return journey, it was far less than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEEM4v"&gt;Despite my test coming in below the &lt;em&gt;lowest&lt;/em&gt; range estimate for the PowerBank, VanMoof still stands by its numbers. “It should give most riders an additional 45-100km range depending on conditions and an individual’s use-level,” said the company in an email response to my findings. Apparently, my aggressive riding style, weight (190 pounds / 86 kg), height (6 feet / 183 cm), and ambient conditions at testing make me an outlier.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PowerBank can be locked into place on a mount that must first be installed on the bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fOYObB"&gt;Some other observations...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN1fRD"&gt;VanMoof e-bikes don’t provide a USB charging port for phones mounted on the handlebar and the arrival of the PowerBank doesn’t change that. That’s an oversight in my opinion. A range extender enables riders to travel longer distances, which often requires GPS navigation on a phone operating at peak brightness and paired with Bluetooth headphones for turn-by-turn directions and maybe some music playing over your 4G / 5G connection. My three-year old iPhone wasn’t up to the task, which meant tethering it to yet another battery I had to carry in my jacket. I forgot about the cable when I stopped off at a ferry crossing, nearly causing me to topple over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEdSOA"&gt;VanMoof says a USB port was considered but was ultimately left off for “waterproofing reasons.” Shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="grIF1h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best VanMoof e-bikes yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dOhzJM"&gt;I should also note that the S3 I tested was one of the models that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;recently added support for Apple’s Find My tracking network&lt;/a&gt;. While that was the headline item, VanMoof’s X3 and S3 e-bikes were also upgraded with improved on-bike displays that are more visible in direct sunlight, and electronic shifters that are more accurate. I complained about the display readability in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;my review last year&lt;/a&gt; and it is slightly improved. More importantly, the e-shifter seems much improved over the S3 variation that I reviewed at launch in April of 2020. At the time I said it glitched on 2 out of 100 shifts, but the automatic four-speed on my new S3 glitched about 1 out of 100+ shifts over my three hours of riding. I characterize a glitch as an unexpected mechanical “clink” sound, a surprise free-wheel of the pedals when you expect to feel resistance, or an obvious feeling of being in the wrong gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxiY3b"&gt;VanMoof, unlike many e-bike makers, is able to constantly improve the hardware and software of its e-bikes because it has a dedicated factory and relatively tight control over a supply chain of custom VanMoof parts. That means it doesn’t have to compete for Shimano shifters or Bosch motors, for example, which left many bike manufactures without parts for months after the recent surge in e-bike demand. Good thing, too. The first shipments of S3 and X3 models were plagued by issue rates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;as high as 10 percent&lt;/a&gt;, the company co-founders told me last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFRKL6"&gt;VanMoof says it also improved the internal wiring of its bikes for better resistance to weather, added new pedals for better grip, and new fender flaps to reduce excess splash on wet roads. It also made the shipping boxes more environmentally friendly — important when you consider that VanMoof ships around 12,000 of those giant boxes a month, as of September 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hU561A"&gt;All this is to say that the 2021 S3 and X3 models, the ones with the “Locate with Apple Find My” label printed under the top tube, are the best VanMoof e-bikes yet, which really is saying something. The new PowerBank option is just icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds Pac-Man, Hello Kitty, Gundam mechs, and more to AR search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSry71UehtkravCv4F8zsfnc5n4=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69154559/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_14.42.54.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XhwWeH"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/japanese-characters-ar/"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of popular Japanese characters to its AR feature in mobile search, which has previously featured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171601/google-adds-augmented-reality-ar-animals-search-3d"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400577/google-arts-and-culture-augmented-reality-prehistoric-creatures-museum-exhibits"&gt;historical artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308071/google-search-augmented-reality-animals-dinosaurs-tyrannosaurus-rex-velociraptor-triceratops"&gt;dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;. The list of characters is taken from Japanese pop culture including anime, TV, and video games, with names like Pac-Man, Hello Kitty, mechs from Evangelion and Gundam, and more. The feature works on Google search on Android and the iOS Google app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZPAyI"&gt;When you enter the characters’ names, you’ll see an option to “see in your space” below the main search result, and that’ll let you drop a 3D model into your camera view. The models can appear at various degrees of scale, with an option to render at life size, though I’m not sure quite how accurate those measurements are. I was under the impression that Hello Kitty was five apples tall, for example, but she towered over my desk when I tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZWUeQCTnyOqYovKVVuZ75ZcySc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456500/AR_Anime_EN.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rsGC8u"&gt;The full list of characters is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mFnxoh"&gt;Ultraman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wgSY13"&gt;Ultraman Zero&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ekhymm"&gt;Ultraman Belial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N2dwUs"&gt;Gomora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cemAjs"&gt;Evangelion (EVA-01 Test Type)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Li0tRu"&gt;Gundam (Odysseus Gundam, Xi Gundam, Penelope)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R9NXaz"&gt;Cogimyun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8eVr2V"&gt;The drums from &lt;em&gt;Taiko no Tatsujin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1zvXYs"&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6heNrj"&gt;Pompompurin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0S44KJ"&gt;Little Twin Stars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mXYV1I"&gt;Google says that Pac-Man is by far the most searched-for character out of the list, with more than twice as many searches as for Hello Kitty at #2. Apparently, the top country for Pac-Man searches is Peru.&lt;/p&gt;
