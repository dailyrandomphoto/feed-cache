    <title>Facebook hit a key climate goal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="App Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RH5rfLfFusvDjQUxGlsrmtXhMv0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130975/1232289899.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UwtAkk"&gt;Facebook announced today that it exceeded&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one of its biggest environmental goals: it managed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 94 percent in 2020. It had previously pledged to cut planet-heating emissions by 75 percent. The company said that it had also achieved its goal of “net zero emissions” — not putting any more emissions into the atmosphere than it can take out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzcRqm"&gt;Facebook also announced that it had achieved another goal: it now purchases enough renewable energy to cover 100 percent of its global operations, which includes its offices and data centers. But that doesn’t mean that all of its operations are actually powered by renewables like solar and wind energy — at least not yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TwVE1E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy to cover 100 percent of its global operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IT7sOt"&gt;Renewable energy is on the rise, but most electricity grids still rely on fossil fuels. When companies can’t purchase enough renewable energy from utilities because there isn’t enough supply, they buy renewable energy certificates that signal that the company invested in renewable energy projects somewhere. Those projects can be located anywhere, and certificates have been sold for so cheap that critics say they &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/what-it-really-means-when-google-and-apple-say-they-run-on-100-renewable-energy-f6d1719fd865"&gt;don’t really lead to more renewable energy generation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook also relies on renewable energy certificates, but it focuses on signing long-term contracts to support the construction of new solar and wind developments in the same places where it operates. It’s invested in 63 new renewable energy projects located on the same electrical grids as its data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbV9Um"&gt;Its next target is to reach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437208/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-greenhouse-gas-pledge"&gt;net zero emissions by 2030&lt;/a&gt; for its entire supply chain and other indirect emissions that come from things like employee travel and commuting. To hit that goal, Facebook says that it developed environmental standards for its suppliers. It also plans to rely more heavily on emerging technologies that draw carbon dioxide out of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6gVQ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Misinformation about climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UN4xcA"&gt;Facebook has recently also tried to limit misinformation about climate change on its platform. Last year, it launched a “Climate Science Information Center” in some countries. In the UK this year, it started adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288439/facebook-label-climate-change-posts-misinformation"&gt;label&lt;/a&gt; to some posts about climate change that redirect people to its information center. It all comes on the heels of criticism from activists and policymakers over how misinformation about climate change festered on the site, including one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368136/facebook-climate-change-fact-check-senators-warren"&gt;high-profile case&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook reversing a “false” rating that its fact-checkers gave to an op-ed based on inaccurate information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEpq3G"&gt;“We know the next 10 years will be the defining time for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and that we have a role to play in this effort — both as a platform that connects people to information and as a global company that supports climate action,” Facebook’s director of renewable energy, Urvi Parekh, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/renewable-energy/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHXVb6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus adds new workouts designed specifically for pregnant, beginner, and older users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0c5dFFELiunEvEezdXUmUamDso=/59x0:1925x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130908/Apple_iphone12_apple_fitness_plus_workout_for_pregnancy_and_older_adults_and_beginners_041521.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1XnN9E"&gt;Apple is adding a variety of new workouts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;its $9.99-per-month Fitness Plus service&lt;/a&gt;, including programs designed specifically for beginners and workouts tailored for both pregnant and elderly users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mPJK6"&gt;“With more options for getting started, and staying active and healthy during pregnancy as well as at any age or fitness level, we hope even more people will be inspired to keep moving with our amazing team of passionate trainers,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of fitness technologies, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CcRSMS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Fitness Plus review: easy mode","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="til5wu"&gt;The new “Workouts for Pregnancy” program consists of 10 workouts across Apple’s strength, core, and mindful cooldown categories. Each workout is about 10 minutes long and designed specifically for pregnant users, with variations and suggestions for modifying the exercises as a pregnancy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJglp0"&gt;“Workouts for Older Adults,” as the name implies, is a series of eight workouts meant for elderly users. The workouts are generally designed to use either light dumbbells or the user’s bodyweight and feature modifications to use chairs or walls to assist as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZP5AD"&gt;And for beginners who are new to working out (or starting again after a long break), Apple is adding new low-impact yoga, HIIT, and strength classes to help ease newcomers into fitness with basic exercises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOjr4S"&gt;Lastly, Apple Fitness Plus is also adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248678/apple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes"&gt;new “Time to Walk” episode&lt;/a&gt;: an Earth Day-themed program featuring Jane Fonda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fT0ut9"&gt;The newly added Workouts for Pregnancy, Workouts for Older Adults, and Workouts for Beginners, as well as the new Jane Fonda Time to Walk episode, will be added to Apple Fitness Plus on Monday, April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHLW1e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Peloton Bike Plus’ GymKit support no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCnBkghTitXn0Mle-7FbtFSOvSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130830/akrales210108_4344_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZiuLwt"&gt;Peloton debuted its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt; with a much-desired feature: GymKit support. But now, the company’s pulling back some of that functionality. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that GymKit no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes and instead will “only be available in cycling classes for now.” The spokesperson also said: “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines within Apple’s terms of service,” seemingly suggesting bootcamp workouts didn’t fall under those terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYdBuC"&gt;This change is a disruptive one for users who might have purchased the Bike Plus specifically for its GymKit support. It’s the first piece of hardware from the connected fitness company to support GymKit, and the direct Apple Watch integration makes tracking workouts easy, especially during Bike Bootcamp, which fuses cycling and strength exercises. Now, users will have to find a way to track these trickier workouts, like starting a cycling workout, ending it, switching to a strength-training workout, ending it, and so on. People can also try a cross-training workout, but that might not capture the entirety of the workout, either. When paired with the Apple Watch, the Bike Plus also displays users’ heart rates on the screen. This is also now gone from bootcamp classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfguh6"&gt;This is the reality Peloton users will have to deal with for the time being, at least until Apple starts supporting the bootcamp classes in its terms or Peloton figures something out on its end. I have a Bike Plus at home and use it with an Apple Watch, and I noticed the change immediately. It was upsetting! My output always seemed unusually high during bootcamp workouts, so it’s possible they weren’t accurate, but seeing my heart rate on the screen and having my workout automatically tracked was nice. I’m sad to see this functionality go, but I hope it might return in the future, albeit it with more accurate metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook Spin 513 with a Snapdragon 7c processor starts at $480</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/awz9VSnUVYP0v3XYI2qj0mq-zaI=/0x313:3000x2313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130817/Acer_Chromebook_Spin_513_CP513_1H_L__High_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dsskNS"&gt;We already knew Acer was working on the first two Chrome OS devices powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c chips. And today, the company has released two product listings for its Chromebook Spin 513, but you can’t buy this laptop just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wv9jHs"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/acer-chromebook-spin-513-starts-at-479-with-snapdragon-7c/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;AboutChromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Chromebook Spin 513 with the Snapdragon 7c processor has two configuration listings that have appeared on Acer’s website, with a starting price of $479.99. Acer announced in October that the Chromebook Spin would start at $399.99. Additionally, both laptops also do not show 4G LTE for connectivity, which is something that was noted to be a configuration option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtiAuV"&gt;The key difference between the two is the RAM configuration, which is only a $20 price difference. Although the product listing for both Chromebooks include a “Buy Now” button, it is still not available for purchase yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5uyDQ"&gt;The Snapdragon 7c is an entry-level mobile processor that’s built on an 8nm process. Although it is one of the weaker laptop CPUs, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997402/qualcomm-arm-midrange-windows-laptop-processors-8c-7c-8cx-snapdragon"&gt;claims the biggest benefit&lt;/a&gt; for devices powered by this processor is a longer battery life; Acer claims its Chromebook devices powered by the Snapdragon 7c will offer a 14-hour battery life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Core wants to be the YouTube of game development, and now anyone can try it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MX1QhdIDkEs2h3i9TSHSMOenlsM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130744/CoreThumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Manticore Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZtfUjM"&gt;Core, the platform that hopes to help creators build games and players experience them, is launching for free in early access today. It’s available exclusively on the Epic Games Store and already includes over 20,000 free playable games across a wide variety of genres including team-based multiplayer shooters, RPGs, and side-scrollers. Core’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;developer, Manticore Games, says that over a million players and creators have used the platform while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21158189/core-free-game-creation-tool-pc-youtube-twitch"&gt;it’s been in alpha over the past year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOZEA6"&gt;The aim with Core is to make it easier for creators to develop and monetize games, similar to what YouTube did for online video, while gamers get “an endless arcade of high-quality, user-built games and worlds.” The platform’s development tools are built on top of Epic’s Unreal Engine, and it offers premade assets that users can customize, as well as drop-down tools to build games. Custom avatars can work across different experiences, and these can be linked with in-game portals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fY_h_09WIkcdpi9t4zWmlmb-OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445619/CoreEditor4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Manticore Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core’s development tools let creators put games together using premade assets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4QpF7K"&gt;Core’s attempt to make game development easier and more approachable is similar to Media Molecule’s &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; on PS4. However, Manticore Games is attempting to distinguish itself by letting creators monetize their games via its Perks system, which &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201208005796/en/Manticore-Games-Launches-Perks-Core%E2%80%99s-Creator-Economy-Setting-New-Benchmark-for-UGC-Platforms-at-50-Revenue-Share"&gt;launched last December&lt;/a&gt;. Creators have different options for how to monetize their games, ranging from in-game cosmetic purchases to full-on monthly subscriptions, Manticore Games says, and it’s offering a revenue share of 50 percent with creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEYlHu"&gt;To coincide with the launch today, Geoff Keighley is hosting the Core Games Showcase, which will feature appearances from Core’s biggest games and creators. The show kicks off at 1PM ET on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/CoreGamesOfficial"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US institutes new Russia sanctions in response to SolarWinds hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris walk from the Oval Office of the White House, both wearing masks." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3A-1sR8p5K8Ytf_EStGA9LYbcuI=/0x0:4510x3007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130573/51101779936_dce643603a_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/51101779936/" target="_blank"&gt;White House / Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfZQiS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/15/executive-order-on-blocking-property-with-respect-to-specified-harmful-foreign-activities-of-the-government-of-the-russian-federation/"&gt;A White House order issued Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt; directs the US government to expel ten diplomats and place a range of new sanctions on Russian individuals and assets in response to the SolarWinds hack. The order also &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126"&gt;places significant new restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on Russia’s sovereign debt, which will make it more difficult for the country’s government to raise money and support its currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJ2GPW"&gt;“Treasury will target Russian leaders, officials, intelligence services, and their proxies that attempt to interfere in the U.S. electoral process or subvert U.S. democracy,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “This is the start of a new U.S. campaign against Russian malign behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT31wo"&gt;Uncovered in December, the hack saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;more than 250 federal agencies and businesses&lt;/a&gt; compromised by a state-sponsored actor, which exposed a network security company called SolarWinds. The US intelligence service believes with high confidence that the attack was carried out by Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UItQVO"&gt;The sanctions also target 32 individuals believed to have participated in government efforts to influence the 2020 election, a troubling replay of the 2016 influence campaign that hacked members of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. One of those individuals is named Alexei Gromov, a deputy chief of staff in the Russian president’s office, who allegedly led a Kremlin effort that “sought to exacerbate tensions in the United States by discrediting the 2020 U.S. election process,” according to &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126"&gt;a Treasury Department statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Scr9dG"&gt;A number of private-sector cybersecurity firms in Russia were also sanctioned for their work supporting government efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDTuZl"&gt;Since February, the Biden administration has been working to remediate the attack and change federal IT practices to protect against similar attacks in the future. In March, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/03/12/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-administrations-response-to-the-microsoft-and-solarwinds-intrusions/"&gt;a White House spokesperson&lt;/a&gt; described the security failure as the result of “significant gaps in modernization and in technology of cybersecurity across the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AfZVa"&gt;The sanctions mark a new low point in US relations with Russia, made worse by reports that the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/russia-afghanistan-bounties.html"&gt;funded prizes for Taliban killings of US soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as President Vladimir Putin’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-health-idUSKBN2C02IP"&gt;ongoing retaliation against domestic opposition leaders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZU3Kj"&gt;“The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable,” the White House said in a statement. “We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory. However, we have also been clear — publicly and privately — that we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9WdkH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYyAtE"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is once again offering the lowest price yet on the Verizon variant of the OnePlus 8. Originally priced at $800, you can &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615543-REG%2Foneplus_5011101036_8_5g_uw_smartphone.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get this model for $400&lt;/a&gt;. This phone typically costs more than the original OnePlus 8 model because it is compatible with Verizon’s mmWave network. However, because B&amp;amp;H is selling it as unlocked, it will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile networks if either is your preferred phone carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVbKLe"&gt;The OnePlus 8 includes a 6.5-inch OLED screen, a 90Hz refresh rate, and 128GB of storage. Despite its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, debuting a few weeks ago, at $400, this is still a great deal for people looking to upgrade to a 5G-ready smartphone and not spend a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8OcUxU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdpAQR"&gt;Woot is once again offering the lowest price on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. Normally $200, you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a new pair for $165&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes free standard shipping if you have an Amazon Prime account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqNe2O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTx0D8"&gt;If you own an Apple Watch, or recently purchased one in 40mm or 44mm sizes and you are looking to buy a new strap, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-sport-loop-for-apple-watch-40-or-44-mm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Daily Steals&lt;/a&gt; is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers the opportunity to buy an Apple Watch Sport Loop in select colors for $18 when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEAPLEW&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This price also includes a one-year warranty through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AGuII"&gt;Keep in mind; these are Apple-branded Sport Loops, which normally cost $49, and not a third-party band. Daily Steals also has several colors that are no longer available on Apple’s direct website. Only two colors (“pride” and “red”) are available in the 40mm size, while the 44mm model has six colors in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="flaypa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qh5P8O"&gt;Speaking of good deals, if you are interested in picking up Vizio’s Elevate soundbar, which includes 18 speakers and support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fvizio-elevate-p514a-h6-5-1-4-bluetooth-soundbar-speaker&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F15%2F22384306%2Fone-plus-8-verizon-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-apple-watch-sports-loop-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots is still offering a deal on this product&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,000, you can get this rotating soundbar for only $779 when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGEVIZ &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YmEzTp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPULB"&gt;On March 31st, Nintendo pulled &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars &lt;/em&gt;from the Switch eShop, and physical copies are hard to find these days. But if you missed out on picking up this compilation, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737841581771625414#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-3D-All-Stars-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596743%2F103673933&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals04152021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have physical copies of the game available for $50 — $10 off its original price. If you have yet to pick up a copy, now would &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; be a good time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Adia Watts? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNu0R4whAse5SQ5_rsWmAoLTCBQ=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130498/awatts_20210405_4509_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Copy editing amid art&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="WvmhTI"&gt;If you’re not a writer or an editor, you may not appreciate how important copy editors are to publications. They are the ones who keep us from making fools of ourselves with bad grammar, bad spelling, or bad sentence structure; they also often act as fact-checkers. If you do a lot of reading on a variety of sites, you can usually tell which ones use copy editors and which ones do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNZeLb"&gt;Adia Watts is a copy editor for &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Like the rest of the staff, she is currently working from home, and we asked her to talk about her workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh3oPV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yY8J8o"&gt;I make up one-half of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s copy desk. My official title is “video copy editor,” so I make sure our video captions, graphics, and titles are clean. That includes videos on our YouTube channels, social videos, and videos you may see playing on screens in malls (if you’re still going to the mall these days). But I also edit &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s social media copy as well as our daily articles, features, and any other words that may show up on our website. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is my first job out of college, so I’ve had the typical student jobs before this one, but I studied journalism in undergrad and have some experience with audio and video production as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBH8cw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8d5M8"&gt;I currently live at home with my mom, as many young millennials do these days. My bedroom has always had this small extra room attached to it. Before I came along, the room was my mom’s office, then a place to do my homework when I was a child, and most recently, it was just a miscellaneous storage space where we put things that didn’t have a rightful place. So once the pandemic hit and I was home all the time — working and taking classes — I decided to finally tackle this room and make it into something I enjoyed using. I’d already been working from home since 2018, but the added time inside made me really want a place to do work other than my bed or the dining room table. So I made it my summer renovation project to turn it into a home office for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekle8G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcBJk2"&gt;It’s a hand-crank sit / stand desk from a company called Mount-It. (The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmount-it.com%2Fcollections%2Fsit-stand-desks%2Fproducts%2Fmount-it-sit-stand-desk-hand-crank-mi-7931&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22374271%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-adia-watts-copy-editor-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;frame&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmount-it.com%2Fcollections%2Fsit-stand-desks%2Fproducts%2Fmount-it-table-top-for-sit-stand-desk-mi-7936&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22374271%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-adia-watts-copy-editor-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;desktop&lt;/a&gt; were ordered separately.) I would have loved a motorized desk like the ones at Vox Media’s New York City office, but I don’t have many power outlets in this room, so I didn’t want to eliminate one by having something constantly plugged into it. Plus, when I do use it as a standing desk (which, admittedly, is rarely), the turning motion gives me a tiny workout. The desk is about 60 inches wide, and it can be adjusted to about four feet tall. It’s the perfect size for my height, and it has enough space for all of my computers, books, and various desk knickknacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fully desk chair" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sPoKylORHgmQ8Uxz1gnFbRjxMyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441520/awatts_20210405_4509_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fully desk chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under the desk: an ottoman and a wire drawer set" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lj0pX42AMqnAnmS7stQv7h1cn-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441519/awatts_20210405_4509_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the desk: an ottoman and a wire drawer set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCQZbd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a very interesting-looking desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9xHuu"&gt;It’s called the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeWhatsOnYourDesk041421&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Ffully-desk-chair.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully Desk Chair&lt;/a&gt;. (Fully is the name of the company.) It’s very adjustable: the seat, arms, armrests, and back all move and slide in various directions. It also has a plastic sliding lumbar support in the back of the chair, but it really doesn’t stay in place that well. The seat cushion is comfortable, but overall, I find myself fidgeting and changing my sitting position a lot in this chair. I frequently lean to one side to rest on my elbows while I’m sitting, and I find that the armrests dig into my ribs when I do. I wish there were a way to push them down completely. I tried to find a used Herman Miller chair, but they were still very much out of my budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxfn68"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you use the space below your desk for storage. Is the cushion for your feet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Poo2tT"&gt;Yes! I am not a tall person, so when I adjust my desk and chair to the height I like, my feet just barely touch the floor. So I bought this &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1032164/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flory-pouf-textured-teal-green-opalhouse-8482%2F-%2FA-53038886"&gt;Lory pouf ottoman&lt;/a&gt; from Target to have a comfy stool where I can rest my feet. The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2F3-drawer-closet-organizer-with-rustic-oak-finish-top-gray-metal-threshold-8482%2F-%2FA-50418749&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wire drawer set&lt;/a&gt; with all of my many charger cables, pens, pencils, crayons, etc. is also from Target. It’s actually in-closet storage for sweaters and other bulky clothes, but it was perfect for this room, so I couldn’t pass it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tazxqz"&gt;
&lt;div id="PwUEVX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444797" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7OQnrW"&gt;
&lt;p id="qPLODb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your other tech: your computer, display setup, mic setup, and other tech stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwj6J2"&gt;I have two computers here: the 2017 13-inch MacBook Pro that was given to me when I started at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and my new (old) late-2012 21.5-inch iMac. I bought the iMac because I wanted something that would work well with my daily workload of Chrome tabs, Slack, and Spotify, as well as some Adobe software, without kicking up the fans or getting too hot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwLCa"&gt;Despite working at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for three years, I am not tech-savvy, so I can’t tell you which spec on the iMac allows it to work so smoothly. But it has a 3.1GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-3770S, Nvidia GeForce GT 650MB 512GB, 8GB of 1,600MHz DDR3 RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. It works well so far, and I enjoy having such a large screen so I can easily look at multiple windows at once. Having a desktop also gives me a good excuse to get up in the morning and not work from my bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9DusS7"&gt;
&lt;div id="gZ1wVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444814" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oMbyfr"&gt;
&lt;p id="IdSuZY"&gt;Then there’s an Anker Ultra Compact Bluetooth keyboard. The key setup is almost identical to the keyboards on MacBooks, so it feels very familiar to my fingers. The key travel is a little deeper than the shallow clicks of the MacBook Pro, but otherwise, it gets the job done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCFvaD"&gt;My mouse is a standard &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737749377040692881" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M510 Logitech wireless mouse&lt;/a&gt; that I might have also picked up from Target. It has an extremely easy-to-lose USB adapter that slots into the USB-A port on my iMac, so it’s not Bluetooth. It has side buttons that sit next to my thumb for navigating through webpages, a scroll wheel, and rubber grips on either side. It’s very comfortable, convenient, and easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDCd80"&gt;I’ve got a Western Digital 1TB external hard drive that I’ve had since college that has yet to be filled up. Once my personal laptop (an early 2014 13-inch MacBook Air) began slowing down and threatening to give out on me, I started saving everything directly onto the hard drive. Now, I use it mostly to save my personal audio-visual projects that can comprise many storage-eating clips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Beats Solo Pro and an Anker keyboard" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PCCo5PWwjZTRmm4iaD7VhGpjAIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441517/awatts_20210405_4509_0026.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A desk of tech" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-s3_M8XCoyqNbUsGcjlHpZhYO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441524/awatts_20210405_4509_0047.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A desk of tech, including a Beats Solo Pro and a Sony Alpha A6000 camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="71PxnC"&gt;Speaking of audio: my headphones are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-Listening/dp/B07YVYNM3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo Pro&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s picks for the best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. I use them while I work, along with a lofi hip-hop playlist, if outside noise gets to be too much. I actually don’t care for noise cancellation because I like to be aware of what’s going on around me, so I enjoy the Transparency Mode, which uses the Solo Pro’s built-in microphones to allow me to hear ambient sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWzds9"&gt;The microphone is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Textured-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Snowball&lt;/a&gt; that I bought in college when I thought I wanted to be a podcaster. These days, I use it to record audio for TikTok videos in my free time. Like everyone else, I was sucked into the social video app at the beginning of the pandemic, and I use it to share visuals for poetry I’ve written.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEFDHe"&gt;The camera is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Alpha A6000&lt;/a&gt;. I’m no photographer, but I like to take pictures, so I use it mostly when traveling or for special occasions. It currently has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F791322-REG%2FSony_SEL30M35_30mm_f_3_5_Wide_Angle_Lens.html%23donotlink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22374271%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-adia-watts-copy-editor-tech" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony 30mm macro lens&lt;/a&gt; on it that I bought when I thought I wanted to be a food blogger and take close-up pictures of delicious meals. Now, I just take pictures of food with my phone like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="P9a27G"&gt;
&lt;div id="mk6U68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10436511" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NIYYsv"&gt;
&lt;p id="y7i4JI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you have some interesting crafts on your desk, including a vase and — is that a candle or an incense holder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIWYOe"&gt;It’s actually a wax melter. A little tealight candle goes into the opening on the other side, and you can put a wax cube or even oils in the basin on top, and the scent fills the room. The vase that is holding my faux flowers and moisture meter for my plants is a handcrafted piece by an artist who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/akilspots/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;akilspots on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. I picked it up last summer in Brooklyn at the going-away sale that he held before he moved to Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XGwNF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And there are also some really nice art objects on your corner bookcase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrNmla"&gt;Thanks! The bookcase used to be a set of drawers that I deconstructed and painted. The green triangle piece is just some scrap wood that I found around the house and decided to do something with. I tried to do a cool landscape scene, and I think it actually came out pretty nice. On top, I have a wood constellation plaque that my best friend bought me for my 25th birthday. It’s the Cancer constellation (because I’m a Cancer), and underneath, it says my name, my birthday, and some positive traits that Cancers share. Next to that is a zine from &lt;em&gt;CRWN Mag&lt;/em&gt;, a natural hair magazine tailored to Black women, which also happens to be where I did an internship in undergrad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3adXhl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You use the space on your walls particularly well. To begin with, you have some pretty impressive certificates. Can you tell us about them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eytcig"&gt;Sure. There’s my diploma for my bachelor of science from SUNY Oneonta, a certificate for honors in mass communications, and an award from the Africana &amp;amp; Latinx Studies Department for my “courageous advocacy of equality and civil rights.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mirror, an award, and a photograph.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zMhIEZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The art is lovely as well. I especially admire the photograph of the three hands. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gucaBL"&gt;Thank you! The photo of the hands is a piece by photographer Samuel Trotter. It was part of the Black in America archive from &lt;a href="https://seeinblack.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;See In Black&lt;/a&gt;, a collective of Black photographers uplifting and celebrating Black lives and Black art. The collective came together during all of the racial injustice and protests that were occurring last summer as a way to create community and a little positivity for Black people during a tremendously difficult time. Proceeds from the sales of the prints went to several activist organizations working to aid Black communities in America. To me, the hands represent coming together and the self-healing that happens within Black communities and family units whenever there is collective anguish like there was last summer, which continues to be an unfortunate reality in the Black American experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4nkgO"&gt;The Toni Morrison print is from an artist named Zoë Sinclair, who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeWhatsOnMyDesk041421&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fshop%2FFrequencyOfLove" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Frequency of Love&lt;/a&gt; on Etsy. She has an entire collection of prints like these, featuring Black historical icons surrounded by colorful prints reminiscent of African fabrics like kente and Adinkra cloth. I chose Toni Morrison because, as a writer, her moving, descriptive stories inspire my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5VmAO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And finally, I see you have both a whiteboard and a corkboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhdFPC"&gt;Yes, I do. My corkboard usually features different mementos or reminders I need. Right now, I’ve pinned up a vision board that I made at the beginning of 2019, which is slowly but surely coming to fruition. My whiteboard is also for reminders or pieces of information that I need to know. It always contains my Wi-Fi password (which I’ve covered in the picture with markers) for guests and for myself because I can never remember it. But I also use the whiteboard for writing down new ideas that might come to me out of the blue. I once woke up from a nap and wrote the entire introduction paragraph to an essay on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Toni Morrison print by Zoë Sinclair (on the wall, left) and Medusa, the snake plant." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ONrM3KaWL0rK8DobaKIKO65hraI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22445843/awatts_20210405_4509_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Toni Morrison print hangs on the wall at left, above Medusa the snake plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keeping up to date with a corkboard and whiteboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Op62JE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks! Is there anything else interesting about your working space that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bANQs2"&gt;I think that’s it. The only thing left to mention is my sad, dying snake plant. Her name is Medusa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF490I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon added another 50 million Prime subscribers during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QTRldkql6Y73wnoKf7UOnKMJNho=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130468/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UBErQR"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders"&gt;final annual letter&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon’s shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;who will step down in Q3 2021 to make way for Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; — shared that the number of Prime subscribers has reached 200 million. Its Q4 2019 earnings included the milestone of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115823/amazon-q4-19-earnings-prime-membership-fresh-one-day-shipping"&gt;surpassing 150 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to its Prime service that offers fast shipping, original TV content, and more. Essentially, Amazon convinced 50 million people to join Prime during the pandemic, accounting for an approximate 33 percent growth of the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fwurx"&gt;If you haven’t paid attention to the company’s earnings in the past year, Prime subscribers certainly aren’t the only numbers Amazon has been able to grow. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22260133/amazon-q4-2020-quarterly-earnings-jeff-bezos-ceo-transition-andy-jassy"&gt;2020 was the company’s most profitable year yet&lt;/a&gt;, growing bigger during a time when many other businesses shrank or disappeared. To put context on some of the success, halfway through 2020 — around the first big countrywide surge of COVID-19 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"&gt;Amazon was already doubling its profits&lt;/a&gt;. And that came even after the company pledged $4 billion of its Q2 2020 earnings to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), clean its facilities, to ensure “higher wages for hourly teams,” and expand its own COVID-19 testing capabilities. In late March 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353058/amazon-fda-authorization-covid-test-home"&gt;Amazon got FDA authorization for an at-home COVID-19 test kit&lt;/a&gt; that it developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV13QK"&gt;It’s been quite a busy final year for any CEO to steer through — let alone, the one in charge of such a big and profitable company. But despite the success on a company level, it has been a tumultuous year so far from a PR perspective. Amazon’s warehouse employees who contribute to the success still struggle to be recognized and gain ground &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;in their efforts to unionize&lt;/a&gt;. And, lest we forget that 2021 has already seen the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;sparring on Twitter with US state representatives about taxes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as publicly disputing reports that some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;Amazon’s workers pee in bottles&lt;/a&gt; just to meet company targets. It later apologized to Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI) for its “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?”&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359"&gt; tweet from its @AmazonNews&lt;/a&gt; handle, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;while attempting to shift the blame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A federal ‘revenge porn’ ban could transform online harassment laws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Armed Services Committee Hears Testimony On Sexual Harassment At Fort Hood" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsoQifnGVR0nuWdnCJ1kE1X1yIA=/0x1:4208x2806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69130438/1262381615.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agaUJJ"&gt;The US could be on the verge of passing the first federal law against nonconsensual pornography or “revenge porn.” If it does, it could reignite a debate over the balance between punishing serious harms and limiting free expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQ2rPI"&gt;Lawmakers in 46 states (as well as Guam and the District of Columbia) have already passed bans on nonconsensual pornography: nude or sexually explicit images distributed without their subjects’ consent. But activists have long called for a federal law to replace the patchwork of state laws — and now, they’re on the cusp of getting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Tb2ut"&gt;&lt;a href="https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/SPEIER_034_xml210311224936258.pdf"&gt;A new measure&lt;/a&gt; that would ban knowingly or recklessly distributing “intimate visual depictions” of non-consenting subjects has been added as an amendment to the Violence Against Women Act, a reauthorization of a popular 1994 bill meant to protect victims of domestic abuse and assault. The measure passed the House of Representatives in March and currently awaits a vote in the Senate. If it’s ultimately signed into law, offenders would face up to two years in prison for each person whose images they distribute. It would be the first time US federal law has seriously tackled nonconsensual porn, with potentially far-reaching implications for anyone hosting user-uploaded images online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YcLgB5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Offenders would face two years in prison for each person they target&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="59y47B"&gt;The new measure first appeared in 2019 as the standalone SHIELD Act (or the Stopping Harmful Image Exploitation and Limiting Distribution Act), introduced by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and crafted with help from Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) co-founder Mary Anne Franks. The CCRI said the bill saved victims from a “confusing patchwork” of state laws, and in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Franks called the bill “pretty close to ideal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWACcT"&gt;Unlike many anti-nonconsensual pornography rules, the SHIELD Act provisions aren’t contingent on offenders’ motivations — whether, for instance, they intended to harm the victim. It only requires that they knew (or recklessly ignored the possibility) that the image was being shared without consent and that the subject had a reasonable expectation of privacy. That will make prosecutions of offending sites far easier, but it also raises new concerns about possible threats to free expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JiFk3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intent is a dividing line for nonconsensual porn laws&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TzWoOK"&gt;Jessica Magaldi, a Pace University law professor who published a review of “revenge porn” statutes last year, says that’s a relatively rare approach that she’d like to see adopted more broadly. “I would say many of the states are misguided in their attempts,” she says. “They are overly concerned with the intent of the perpetrator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgtcjv"&gt;Despite the name, most “revenge porn” incidents aren’t actually about revenge. The CCRI estimates that around 20 percent of cases are specifically aimed at causing harm, while “the vast majority are motivated by something else: a desire for profit, notoriety, social standing, amusement, voyeurism, or no particular reason at all,” says Franks. “Far too many state laws treat nonconsensual pornography as a form of harassment, which it only sometimes is, rather than as an invasion of sexual privacy and a form of sexual exploitation, which it always is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="123jdk"&gt;As a federal criminal law, the amendment also avoids a long-standing debate over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits websites’ liability for content hosted by users. Section 230 shields sites against civil suits and state laws, but not federal criminal charges. So law enforcement could theoretically prosecute a site whose owner was intentionally soliciting and posting nonconsensual porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F87m8n"&gt;But some civil liberties groups have raised concerns about open-ended nonconsensual pornography bills. The ACLU &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/free-speech-and-media-groups-applaud-governors-veto-overbroad-revenge-porn-bill"&gt;warns that&lt;/a&gt; similar state-level laws could stop journalists from publishing newsworthy images of politicians &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/01/how-anthony-weiners-risque-messages-shaped-our-revenge-porn-laws/"&gt;like Anthony Weiner&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, or punish booksellers for not verifying the source of any nude image in a publication. (The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it hasn’t formulated a position on the SHIELD Act, but it’s challenged other bills in recent years.) Depending on how courts interpret “reckless disregard” for someone’s consent or privacy, sharing a nude or sexual image could be risky if you simply don’t &lt;em&gt;know &lt;/em&gt;where it comes from. The SHIELD Act provision currently facing Congress includes an exception for images that touch on “a matter of public concern,” but some people may stay silent rather than risk having to argue that case in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F6iFLB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we actually want to solve problems, we have to be very precise”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3MNsn"&gt;Legal blogger and Santa Clara University School of Law professor Eric Goldman questions whether the bill would meaningfully improve the legal landscape when there are already laws covering harassment, invasion of privacy, and other overlapping issues. “What case is it designed to solve that isn’t already addressed by a panoply of other laws, especially if there’s been a tidal wave of new nonconsensual pornography laws at the state level?” Goldman asked in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If we actually want to solve problems, we have to be very precise about how this tool is additive and responsive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpjcdp"&gt;As Goldman points out, a federal ban alone wouldn’t punish nonconsensual pornography perpetrators. The Department of Justice would have to dedicate time and personnel to catching offenders and bringing cases against them. “Are they going to devote resources to this?” he asks. If not, law enforcement could use the rule to stack charges against a few chosen targets — but many perpetrators would still be let off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXYros"&gt;Then there’s the question of whether the laws will withstand constitutional scrutiny. Many nonconsensual pornography laws have passed at the state level, but while several courts have examined them, there’s no consensus yet about whether they violate the First Amendment. Vermont’s Supreme Court upheld its law in 2018, although &lt;a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2019/06/vermont-supreme-court-dismisses-nonconsensual-pornography-prosecution-state-v-vanburen.htm"&gt;the case testing it&lt;/a&gt; was eventually dismissed. A &lt;a href="http://www.wisconsinappeals.net/on-point-by-the-wisconsin-state-public-defender/court-of-appeals-rejects-constitutional-challenges-to-ban-on-posting-or-publishing-private-pictures-felon-in-possession-statute/"&gt;Wisconsin appeals court&lt;/a&gt; reached the same conclusion, as did &lt;a href="https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/people-v-austin-is-revenge-porn-constitutionally-protected-speech"&gt;the Supreme Court of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. These courts found “overwhelmingly” that there’s a compelling interest in protecting the privacy of intimate photos and videos, says Magaldi’s co-author Jonathan Sales, a lecturer at Bentley University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="201aor"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Supreme Court turned down an appeal over a state law&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YIJbis"&gt;The laws haven’t been uniformly upheld, though. A Texas appeals court &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/19/appeals-court-strikes-down-texas-revenge-porn-law/"&gt;shot down a law&lt;/a&gt; similar to the SHIELD Act in 2018, saying the rule wasn’t narrowly tailored enough to avoid potentially chilling effects on free expression. (The law was &lt;a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/texas-passes-revenge-porn-fix-11668838"&gt;amended to require&lt;/a&gt; an “intent to harm” the person involved.) And even when laws have been upheld, judges have conceded that only the Supreme Court can really settle their First Amendment implications. The Supreme Court had a chance to examine a nonconsensual pornography case in 2019, but it refused to hear the appeal of a woman convicted under Illinois law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSNvNz"&gt;If the court takes up a case in the future, it will have to weigh whether preventing harm to victims risks chilling speech. Nonconsensual pornography doesn’t clearly fall under an established exception to the First Amendment — narrow categories like threats or defamation — and Sales notes that the court rarely creates new exceptions. But courts could still acknowledge that there’s a valid public interest in protecting people’s privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0CzH2z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is a clear record of people having been damaged”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mncbTD"&gt;“There is a clear record of people having been damaged,” says Sales — including through public embarrassment and lost jobs, and in a way that’s particularly acute for women, who make up the majority of “revenge porn” victims. “At the intersection of these damages that people suffer is a compelling governmental interest in regulating this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5vrjw"&gt;For now, advocates are mostly concerned with getting the provision into law. The Violence Against Women Act could still get held up by the Senate or have the SHIELD provisions stripped out in reconciliation. Speier has made multiple attempts at passing federal nonconsensual porn bans, including the SHIELD Act and the 2017 ENOUGH Act, but never received a vote. But either way, Magaldi believes the issue will only become more pressing. “This just goes the way of many laws that affect women,” she says. “They take a while for people to even realize that they’re important.”&lt;/p&gt;
