    <title>Spotify, Discord, and others are coming back online after a brief Google Cloud outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVNx-BX57ofAIk0zIwy_NEwi-rk=/68x0:728x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150358/image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKrPnB"&gt;Sites and services like Spotify, Discord, Snapchat, and Etsy seem to be recovering after an outage that brought them, and many other sites, down for a little less than an hour on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0XrfL"&gt;The culprit for the outages appears to have been Google Cloud, and &lt;a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/"&gt;the service’s status page&lt;/a&gt; still shows a networking issue is currently causing problems resulting in the 404 errors that appeared on affected web pages. An update to the status page posted at 1:17PM ET says “the issue with Cloud Networking is partially resolved,” and it does seem like most services are coming back to life, albeit with some experiencing a few bugs or long loading times. Google’s status page notes that there currently isn’t an ETA on when the problem will be fully fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8WaFj"&gt;A peek at DownDetector shows the sprawling impact of the issue, with everything from Pokémon Go to Home Depot experiencing issues. We’ve reached out to some of the affected companies and will update this post as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfrt8G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/6PM5mNd43NbMqjCZ5REh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Status Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yraHtf"&gt;Summary: Global: Experiencing Issue with Cloud networking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq85jp"&gt;Description: We are experiencing an issue with Cloud Networking beginning at Tuesday, 2021-11-16 09:53 US/Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBGYnG"&gt;Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PM95Vh"&gt;We will provide an update by Tuesday, 2021-11-16 10:40 US/Pacific with current details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l6BPI"&gt;We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KHfrp"&gt;Diagnosis: Customers may encounter 404 errors when accessing web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwe9NS"&gt;Workaround: None at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="Vlhg6x"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7krI20"&gt;The tracker &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that many of the services started experiencing issues at the same time,  which points to a common provider experiencing issues, rather than something like an ISP disruption or individual sites coincidentally having issues at the same time. Similar to previous outages that came from problems at Fastly or AWS, the reliance of services on other providers can help them offer content at a massive scale, but if there’s a problem then all of them can go down at once.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting a new Media Player app you can test today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXENMFZ_CYrgE64C4L_GpC5hARU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150419/MainScreen.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s new media player.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rh4BP0"&gt;Microsoft has created a new Media Player app for Windows 11, and it’s beginning to test the app with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel today. The redesigned Media Player app will support both audio and video, and it includes a design that better matches Windows 11’s UI improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDzyDx"&gt;“At the heart of Media Player is a full-featured music library that allows you to quickly browse and play music, as well as create and manage playlists,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/16/new-media-player-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;explains Dave Grochocki&lt;/a&gt;, a senior program manager lead for Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps team. “The update to the new Media Player will replace the Groove Music app.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8j5Cedbhli_tSwZ0uo4XagZwnaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019276/Playback_Music.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new artist imagery in Media Player.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOSLCj"&gt;The playback view in this new Media Player app includes album art or artist imagery, which will appear both in full-screen modes and the mini player option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvDXb1"&gt;Media Player will also support video, which is usually handled in Windows 10 and Windows 11 in a separate Films &amp;amp; TV app. “All your content in the music and video folders on your PC will appear automatically in your library, but you can also tell Media Player where to look for additional content in app settings,” says Grochocki.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhTTkZOuWVjilguF0IHHP0lTrf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019279/Playback_Video.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video is also supported in this Windows 11 Media Player app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6eDMfM"&gt;It’s clear this Media Player app is also designed to replace the legacy Windows Media Player app that still exists in Windows 11 today. Microsoft says this legacy app will continue to be available in Windows Tools, but it looks like the new Media Player for Windows 11 will be the primary way to watch video and listen to audio in the operating system soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyCveG"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test this new Media Player app with Windows 11 testers in the Dev Channel today, but the company hasn’t committed to a date for when all Windows 11 users will get this new app yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s sci-fi haptic glove prototype lets you feel VR objects using air pockets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Meta haptic glove prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cseyY47bU39t0JFgbVGQSWnERjA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150322/RL___Haptic_Glove_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irs7Vf"&gt;You cannot pet a dog in Meta’s new, high-tech virtual reality gloves. But researchers are getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PCp0P"&gt;Meta (formerly Facebook) is known for its high-profile moves into virtual and augmented reality. For seven years, though, it’s been quietly working on one of its most ambitious projects yet: a haptic glove that reproduces sensations like grasping an object or running your hand along a surface. While Meta’s not letting the glove out of its Reality Labs research division, the company is showing it off for the first time today, and it sees the device — alongside other wearable tech — as the future of VR and AR interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IMNP4"&gt;At a simplified level, Meta’s haptics prototype is a glove lined with around 15 ridged and inflatable plastic pads known as actuators. The pads are arranged to fit along the wearer’s palm, the underside of their fingers, and their fingertips. The glove also acts as a VR controller. The back features small white markers that let cameras track how the fingers move through space, and it’s got internal sensors that capture how the wearer’s fingers are bending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Reality Labs haptic glove" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGGnMyO-l4Ud2KaRFS9C2aInuew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019162/RL___Haptic_Glove_1scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OuQocj"&gt;When you put on the glove and enter a VR or AR experience, a sophisticated control system adjusts the level of inflation, creating pressure on different parts of your hand. If you’re touching a virtual object with your fingertips, you’ll feel the sensation of that object pressing into your skin. If you’re gripping a virtual item, the long finger actuators will stiffen, creating a sensation of resistance. These sensations work alongside visual and audio cues to produce the illusion of physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONZF7h"&gt;The tech draws on the relatively new field of soft robotics, replacing bulky motors with tiny air valves. Meta has been working on it nearly since it acquired the Oculus VR startup in 2014. It developed its first prototype — one finger with a single actuator — in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="piEsek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reality Labs has been working on this prototype for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KQwuk"&gt;One of the first experiences that Reality Labs head Michael Abrash recalls was looking at a virtual plate from inside a VR headset — where a single actuator, combined with the virtual image and the sound of rubbing the rough ceramic, was incredibly convincing. “I saw the plate, and I saw my finger on the plate, and I heard the sound — that kind of scraping sound across it — and I felt the vibration,” he says. “And I will tell you, I was running my finger over a ceramic plate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGNYM"&gt;Simulated touch isn’t an entirely new phenomenon. Even combining VR with something as simple as controller vibrations can make people feel more like they’re touching something, and many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/13/5805628/at-e3-virtual-reality-goes-beyond-goggles"&gt;have worked on wearables&lt;/a&gt; that either track users’ hands or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21037855/teslasuit-glove-vr-haptic-feedback-glove-announce-pricing-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;provide haptic sensation&lt;/a&gt;. Some even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14773870/axonvr-haptx-vr-haptic-box-pressure-temperature-gdc-2017"&gt;integrate temperature sensations&lt;/a&gt;, which Reality Labs isn’t prioritizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trgBiY"&gt;But Meta is poised to mass-market haptic gloves in a way other companies can’t. Most haptics device makers sell specialized products for military, industrial, or academic institutions. By contrast, Meta produces the dominant consumer-oriented Quest VR system and is putting billions of dollars toward &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;building a “metaverse” that integrates VR and AR&lt;/a&gt;. If it launches a haptic glove system, Meta can guarantee the system will work on the Quest and encourage app developers to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGAFXZ"&gt;Reality Labs imagines gloves being one of multiple controller methods for future glasses and headsets, alongside more lightweight solutions built on electromyography or EMG — a system that reads nerve signals on your arm and translates them into digital input. Meta acquired EMG wristband company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;CTRL-Labs in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the EMG team works separately from the haptic design team, although the two technologies could easily overlap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GktEq7"&gt;“[Doug] Engelbart and Xerox PARC are the only time that fundamentally the way we interact with the digital world has ever changed,” Abrash says — referring to the invention of the mouse and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto"&gt;Alto desktop computer design&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, something that helped set the course of modern personal computing. “AR glasses are going to require that to happen. You’re not going to walk around with a keyboard and mouse. You’re not going to be taking out your phone to interact with it.” For some tasks, you might want a simple wristband. For others, you’d want fuller tactile sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpxzSX"&gt;There are still many barriers to producing consumer-ready haptic gloves, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFfniy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With garments in general, we expect them to be washable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TZWL48"&gt;On one hand, the team wants to dramatically increase glove actuator density, going from tens to hundreds or even thousands within a few years. Right now, the gloves can offer a sense of objects’ contours, but not fine distinctions between surfaces — it relies instead on the suggestive power of audio and images. “You could pet a dog, but you wouldn’t feel the texture,” says Reality Labs engineer Katherine Healy. “You need high-density actuation to be able to really get that sensation, and this glove does not do that.” Meta might not be prioritizing something as specific as fur, but it wants to produce more broadly high-quality sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVfjP0"&gt;On the other hand — or more literally, the same hand — the gloves need a dramatic size reduction. Meta’s prototype is svelter than something like a ‘90s Nintendo Power Glove, but that’s not saying much. Healy says the device needs to be light enough that people feel like they can normally interact with the real world as well as the virtual one, and it needs to go fully wireless, rather than relying on a tether like it does now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Meta Reality Labs engineer Katherine Healy with a haptic glove" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3z0lTtV9DK_xG9KLGR3_bqnIfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019166/RL___Kate_Healyscaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V94xtc"&gt;To make things even more complicated, haptic gloves need to fit precisely against wearers’ skin. That could require designing differently fitting versions for each buyer, possibly through a process like 3D knitting, which can &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/08/3d-knitting-weaving-spinning-printing#:~:text=3D%20knitting%20takes%20a%20digital,get%20on%20with%20its%20job."&gt;produce an object of clothing from a custom-sized digital design&lt;/a&gt;. Then there are practical questions like how to clean a high-tech glove — right now, it’s carefully wiped down with alcohol. “With garments in general, we expect them to be washable,” says Healy. “We would love to be able to create a glove that could be washed. How? We don’t know yet. But that’s part of our vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYo3FS"&gt;If the gloves are commercialized, they’ll face the same privacy and security challenges as other wearables that collect biometric information. Abrash compares using technology like EMG wristbands to typing on a keyboard, something that’s rarely described as a potential threat. But wearable technology can analyze people’s physical motion at a fine level, while even basic typing patterns can &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/typing-patterns-diagnose-early-onset-parkinsons-0401"&gt;predict the onset&lt;/a&gt; of diseases like Parkinson’s. Meta will need to establish policies governing how much of that data leaves users’ devices and who else has access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4SBoa6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a new physics where nothing is solid on a large scale”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6pBYdx"&gt;For now, the team is just trying to work out how real is real &lt;em&gt;enough &lt;/em&gt;for VR touch. “One of the interesting things about haptic gloves is that obviously we can’t reproduce reality exactly, which is different from audiovisual stuff,” says Abrash. A super-dense screen could be almost distinguishable from a real image, and a sound wave could capture the sensation of hearing somebody speak. But Meta can’t realistically make a glove that will stop your hand from going through a virtual table. Instead, it has to find the point where you’ll suspend disbelief and accept that the table is there, even if it objectively feels more like jello than hard wood. “There’s a new physics where nothing is solid on a large scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpD5s2"&gt;And as for the dog? “It seems likely to me that if the haptic gloves work out, you’ll be able to pet a dog, but it will be a virtual dog and it will be a slightly different experience,” says Abrash. “But basically — emotionally, experientially — it will feel as real.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10 on Arm will no longer get x64 app emulation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0be2zk_2sHXORm4NZRDWJqvsh5w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150314/akrales_190930_3688_0196.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GRSqmI"&gt;Microsoft started testing x64 emulation for Windows 10 on Arm nearly a year ago, but the company is now limiting the feature to Windows 11. The planned feature allows x64 apps that haven’t been compiled for Arm-powered machines to run, allowing devices like the Surface Pro X to access even more apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omjYY2"&gt;“x64 emulation for Windows is now generally available in Windows 11,” reads an &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/"&gt;update to a Microsoft blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “For those interested in experiencing this, a PC running Windows 11 on Arm is required.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7Mgae"&gt;That means if you were testing the feature on Windows 10, it’s no longer going to ship in any future operating system updates. You’ll need to upgrade a device like a Surface Pro X to Windows 11, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O77AuT"&gt;Microsoft says it’s still committed to “supporting customers on Windows 10 on Arm through October 14, 2025,” but the lack of x64 app emulation will certainly force many on Qualcomm-powered hardware over to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDgopE"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t detailed why it’s decided to drop x64 emulation on Windows 10 on Arm, but the company is also announcing it’s accelerating the rollout of Windows 11 faster than the company previously anticipated. That means even more devices will be eligible for the free upgrade, and hopefully more Arm-powered ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LgiE33"&gt;Today, Instagram is officially launching its Badges feature, which gives viewers a way to pay and support creators on Instagram Live. Although the feature has been in testing for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271009/instagram-ads-igtv-live-badges-test-update-creators"&gt;around a year and a half&lt;/a&gt; on an invite-only basis, starting today Instagram will allow any eligible creators on the platform to apply for the feature. Once accepted, viewers will be able to purchase “Badges” during a creator’s livestream to support them financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5xARI"&gt;Badges are available in three different levels, costing $0.99, $1.99, or $4.99, and show up as one, two, or three hearts next to a commenter’s name during a livestream. Any questions or comments posted by a badge owner will be shown more prominently to a creator, and their Instagram name will appear on a list visible to a creator for up to 90 days. Instagram says it won’t take a cut of any revenue paid to creators &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371"&gt;until 2023&lt;/a&gt;, although a &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/2284971015132274"&gt;help page for the feature&lt;/a&gt; notes that Apple or Google take a 30 percent fee for in-app purchases on their respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dd6kMw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instagram won’t take a cut until 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9pobe9"&gt;Although the feature is now widely rolling out in the US, not every Instagram user will be able to have their viewers start buying Badges. Eligible creators need to reside in the country, be over 18 years old, have a creator or business account on the platform, and have at least 10,000 followers. They also need to be in compliance with various Instagram policies and guidelines including its &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.facebook.com_help_instagram_512371932629820&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=ntA8R7yBNCLvIr5DdaWNAp-Uznb1q0mGwOmcNbIj5kI&amp;amp;m=Z1sZIbgNsrvlyOK4mUlHjOMw1Y2i_7ZPnk0IbGhHweOVE787wPuZDAgk8ENOcgtT&amp;amp;s=zPTzcq1DxR117fdJ13veqUYypn7rK7QADElXPTgvDDA&amp;amp;e="&gt;Partner Monetization Policies&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.facebook.com_help_instagram_2635536099905516&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=ntA8R7yBNCLvIr5DdaWNAp-Uznb1q0mGwOmcNbIj5kI&amp;amp;m=Z1sZIbgNsrvlyOK4mUlHjOMw1Y2i_7ZPnk0IbGhHweOVE787wPuZDAgk8ENOcgtT&amp;amp;s=x__kJ-v-ivmUQjUBal4xl0_JjtKCPZLfl80quZKkjks&amp;amp;e="&gt; Content Monetization Policies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.facebook.com_help_instagram_477434105621119&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=ntA8R7yBNCLvIr5DdaWNAp-Uznb1q0mGwOmcNbIj5kI&amp;amp;m=Z1sZIbgNsrvlyOK4mUlHjOMw1Y2i_7ZPnk0IbGhHweOVE787wPuZDAgk8ENOcgtT&amp;amp;s=LxwbJXkCtXx-wj1qSh7LiYr3xaTwXMNuY6ugduU085s&amp;amp;e="&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7534wN"&gt;If you fulfill all those criteria, you’ll find the option to “Set Up Badges” by going to “Profile” and then “Professional Dashboard.” You may need to apply for monetization if you haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will now update Windows 10 annually with new features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4FthdcC6UMPMBjOkMBfqYm7z8GQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150263/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BPxfRJ"&gt;Microsoft says it’s planning to update Windows 10 annually with any future feature updates. Starting today, Microsoft is releasing the Windows 10 November 2021 update, and the next major update after that will be available later in 2022. This update cadence matches the same used by Windows 11, which will also introduce new features on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOkW34"&gt;“We will transition to a new Windows 10 release cadence to align with the Windows 11 cadence, targeting annual feature update releases,” explains John Cable, Microsoft’s head of Windows servicing and delivery. “The next Windows 10 feature update is slated for the second half of 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgwmyP"&gt;Microsoft’s commitment to future Windows 10 feature updates comes after the company was quiet about its plans during the Windows 11 unveiling earlier this year. It’s still not clear what Microsoft will bring to Windows 10 in the future, though. The November 2021 update is very minor, with the only standout feature for users being GPU compute support in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Microsoft has also already started rolling out the new Microsoft Store to Windows 10 devices earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lG2N6y"&gt;Most of Microsoft’s future Windows plans are understandably for Windows 11, but the company will support at least one version of Windows 10 until October 14th, 2025. We could see two or maybe three feature updates to Windows 10 until its end of support date, but they’re not likely to be significant ones anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCnRZx"&gt;Microsoft is also accelerating its rollout of Windows 11 today. “Based on the positive rollout update experience and user feedback we have seen to date, we are advancing the pace of the rollout faster than we previously anticipated, and now making the Windows 11 upgrade more broadly available to eligible Windows 10 devices,” says Cable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Moon landing will likely be delayed ‘several years’ beyond 2024, auditors say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AoTamz060eVReHBtxFSWCF1rysI=/228x0:6492x4176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150247/51614473753_60838ac103_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Orion spacecraft for NASA’s Artemis I mission lifted above the Space Launch System at Kennedy Space Center&lt;/em&gt; | NASA/Frank Michaux&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hjBBQ0"&gt;Last week, NASA announced that it was bumping back plans to send humans to the Moon from 2024 to 2025, &lt;a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf"&gt;but according to a new report&lt;/a&gt;, the delays could be even more significant. More realistically, such a landing will probably take place several years after 2024, the report claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyCwyd"&gt;The recent prediction comes from NASA’s Office of the Inspector General, which does periodic audits of the space agency’s various programs. In its latest report, the OIG took a comprehensive look at NASA’s Artemis program, the agency’s ambitious initiative to send people back to the Moon, as well as land the first woman and the first person of color on the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbFRIY"&gt;NASA created the Artemis program during the Trump administration. In 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence challenged NASA with speeding up the program’s timetable in order to land humans on the Moon in just five years. But Pence’s announcement was considered an incredible long shot. NASA’s Artemis program relies on a suite of complicated vehicles all working together to get astronauts safely to the Moon, including a massive new rocket called the Space Launch System, or SLS, that will send people to deep space inside a new crew capsule called Orion. Meanwhile, SpaceX is developing its next-generation spacecraft, called Starship, to carry people to and from the lunar surface for NASA — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;part of a $2.9 billion contract&lt;/a&gt; awarded to the company in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t5KqSH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we project NASA will exceed its current timetable for landing humans on the Moon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGgi58"&gt;However, Starship is still in very early stages of development and has yet to launch to orbit. SLS and Orion also have not flown on their first flight together. The OIG report, released Monday, highlights these issues and reveals just how much work is left to be done on Artemis, making a 2024 landing date unrealistic. “Given the time needed to develop and fully test the HLS and new spacesuits, we project NASA will exceed its current timetable for landing humans on the Moon in late 2024 by several years,” the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DoHP1"&gt;Just last week, NASA also admitted that the 2024 landing date isn’t going to happen. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772427/nasa-artemis-program-moon-lunar-landing-2025-delay"&gt;the agency simply moved the new target to 2025&lt;/a&gt;. NASA blamed the adjustment on various factors including delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in scope to some of the programs, as well as an ongoing lawsuit that stifled development on SpaceX’s lunar lander. Rival space company Blue Origin had also hoped to receive a contract from NASA to develop a lunar lander, but when the space agency gave the award to SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;the company sued in federal court&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit prevented NASA and SpaceX from working together on the lander until the litigation was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrY7Vg"&gt;The OIG report notes that the lawsuit did have an impact on the overall schedule, but the office also argues that the development schedule for SpaceX’s Starship is overly optimistic. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk continues to make bold predictions for Starship’s first major test launch, claiming multiple times it’d be ready to fly to orbit for the first time this year. However, the OIG report estimates the first orbital flight test of Starship will occur sometime in the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJNiDx"&gt;The document does argue that SpaceX may be able to shave off some time due to its speedy testing pace compared with earlier NASA spaceflight programs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But there is still quite a lot of work to be done after Starship’s orbital flight test. Starship’s design relies on the vehicle being refueled while in orbit, in order to have enough propellant to reach the Moon. SpaceX still needs to test out that capability, something it has never done before. Then it will have to do an uncrewed landing before doing one with people on board. All of these milestones, combined with many of the other programs that need to be finished, have the OIG estimating a lunar landing with people sometime in 2026 at the very earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FObm93"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The OIG estimates that NASA will spend $93 billion on Artemis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H0viz8"&gt;It’s not just Starship’s schedule that is off target. The OIG report predicts that the debut of NASA’s SLS rocket and Orion combo will also be delayed. Right now, NASA is working toward a launch as early as February 2022 — a mission called Artemis I that will send the rocket and capsule on a weekslong trip around the Moon without crew on board. However, the Inspector General anticipates that flight will be pushed to summer of 2022 instead. Such a delay would not be unheard of for SLS and Orion, which were originally supposed to fly together as early as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alJbn0"&gt;Perhaps the most shocking finding of the report is the substantial price tag for the major Artemis programs. The OIG estimates that NASA will spend $93 billion on Artemis between 2012 and 2025. And each flight of SLS with Orion on top will cost roughly $4.1 billion. That’s about twice as much as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/the-white-house-puts-a-price-on-the-sls-rocket-and-its-a-lot/"&gt;an estimate from the White House Office of Management and Budget&lt;/a&gt;, which claimed SLS would cost more than $2 billion to fly each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1lB8C"&gt;The OIG report points the finger at how the SLS and Orion are contracted. The vehicles are being built by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, respectively, under a type of contract known as cost-plus. This method allows NASA to have substantial oversight in the development process and continue to provide additional funds to the contractors if things go over budget. Conversely, SpaceX’s Starship is being built through a fixed-price contract; NASA has less oversight through this method and provides one lump sum of money to SpaceX for development, while the company invests its own money to get the vehicle to the finish line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2nsjC"&gt;The OIG notes that using such fixed-price contracts could help NASA save on costs as it strives to send people to the Moon and eventually to Mars. “With the emerging capabilities provided by commercial partners, the Agency may have future options that can help control costs to meet its exploration goals,” the report states. However, without a more realistic schedule, it’ll be difficult to know the true costs and timeframe for the program going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Health apps and wearables help rich people the most, study finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fitness Trackers Running" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sxQBWbBAzLlbFSKkOF-0PIq0mVI=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150229/TSS_040_Running_v8.Still013.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i5nb2M"&gt;Digital tools like motivational text messages that try to nudge people to do more physical activity aren’t effective&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for poor people, according to &lt;a href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-021-01218-4#Sec15"&gt;a new meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. In one of the most comprehensive efforts to tease apart the impact of behavioral change programs on people with different income levels, the study authors showed that apps and wearables only helped bump physical activity levels for people with high socioeconomic status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56oidM"&gt;The finding &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/26/unless-its-done-carefully-the-rise-of-telehealth-could-widen-health-disparities/"&gt;bolsters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30317-4/fulltext"&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt; that digital health interventions can end up widening health gaps between groups and that they’re designed for people with more money and more education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IA3ha"&gt;The new analysis looked at 19 studies that tested whether things like text messages, web-based prompts, or wearable step trackers could nudge people to increase their levels of physical activity. Across all of the studies, the behavioral tools were not effective for people with low socioeconomic status, even when they worked well for wealthier people. That pattern held across every type of approach tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnXW3c"&gt;Digital health tools are often described as ways to shrink health inequality because they can package useful health interventions into cheaper, easy-to-distribute forms. More and more people are gaining access to the tools and technologies (like phones and wearable devices) that deploy them. This study, though, indicates that even when people in high- and low-income brackets both have access to digital health tools, those tools don’t necessarily narrow health gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsRgH2"&gt;The study authors point to a few reasons why that might be the case. People of lower socioeconomic status tend to have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22357448/"&gt;lower electronic health literacy&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that they are less able to use technology to improve their health. They may not be as able to navigate the physical activity tools or apply them as effectively. They may also not have as much time as wealthier consumers to do the types of things the digital tools suggest, like going for more walks or exercising more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pzfgf4"&gt;This analysis looked specifically at digital tools that aim to boost physical activity, but the study authors wrote that it’s reasonable to assume that there would be the same pattern in programs that target other types of health behaviors. As health becomes more and more digitized — with the adoption of electronic health records, introduction of more systems that track patients’ at home, and a shift towards telemedicine — figuring out how technological change exacerbates inequality is even more critical, the authors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYeAc5"&gt;But even if the problem appears to be industry-wide, it might be difficult to convince the people developing digital health tools to figure out ways to ensure that their products benefit lower-income groups, the study authors wrote. The goal for most consumer-focused digital health companies is to make money, and their focus is often on the customers mostly like to buy their products. “The onus will likely be on researchers and public health advocates to address the discrepancy,” the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s Oculus Quest 2 has shipped 10 million units, according to Qualcomm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gCQFr"&gt;Meta has sold 10 million &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 headsets&lt;/a&gt;, according to Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon at the company’s 2021 investor day, giving the best benchmark yet for sales of Meta’s standalone VR platform since it launched last October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaRNat"&gt;“Our technologies are the ticket to the metaverse,” Amon said, highlighting Qualcomm’s efforts to establish itself as a key player in VR and AR platforms, especially as the tech industry at large is so heavily emphasizing the metaverse concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VFAqng"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ooooh &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qualcomm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cristianoamon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@cristianoamon&lt;/a&gt; is talking about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XR?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XR&lt;/a&gt; leadership and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Meta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Meta&lt;/a&gt; partnership as well as others like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Lenovo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; and says their technologies are the ticket into the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Metaverse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Metaverse&lt;/a&gt; says Quest 2 was 10 million units and that was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapdragon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Snapdragon&lt;/a&gt; XR2  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/QID2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#QID2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JOcQ6iwcjw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JOcQ6iwcjw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anshel Sag (@anshelsag) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anshelsag/status/1460631153564659716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wi3A7s"&gt;The news doesn’t come directly from Meta itself, but given that the Quest 2 relies on &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/10/29/oculus-quest-2-how-snapdragon-xr2-powers-next-generation-vr"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 chipset&lt;/a&gt; to power its standalone VR hardware, Qualcomm does seem like it would have an accurate number for how many headsets have been sold. The previous benchmark for Quest 2 sales came from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596076/facebook-oculus-quest-2-storage-upgrade-foam-face-mask-recall"&gt;Meta’s voluntary recall&lt;/a&gt; of about 4 million headsets from over the summer, making today’s 10 million mark a significant increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXIGzx"&gt;The 10 million mark for the Quest 2 is also particularly significant given Meta’s goals for growing a comprehensive VR platform: back in 2019, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg commented alongside the launch of the original Quest headset that 10 million users was a key threshold before the “ecosystem will just explode.” Mark Bosworth, Meta’s VP of augmented and virtual reality, had also told &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-bosworth-10-million-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; over the summer&lt;/a&gt; that he expected Meta to reach its goal of 10 million users “earlier than we had initially expected.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a flood of leaks, the company formerly known as Facebook is getting more secretive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6o45y1"&gt;Last month, a researcher for Meta prepared a talk for colleagues that they knew would hit close to home. The subject: how to cope as a researcher when the company you work for is constantly receiving negative press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHTXP7"&gt;The talk had been approved and taped to show at the company’s annual research summit for employees in early November. But shortly before the event, Meta’s legal and communications department determined that the risk of the contents leaking were too great. So it disappeared from the research summit’s agenda days before, along with another pre-taped talk describing efforts to combat hate speech and bullying. Both talks never saw the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3bklE"&gt;The pulling of the talks highlights how a barrage of leaks and external scrutiny has chilled the flow of information inside the company formerly known as Facebook. Many of the changes appear designed to thwart the next Frances Haugen, who worked in the Integrity organization responsible for making the social network safer before she quit earlier this year, taking thousands of internal documents with her. Those documents served as the basis for a series of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;damning stories in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and dozens of other news outlets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Some of them, such as internal research showing Instagram and Facebook can have negative effects on young people, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;led to congressional hearings&lt;/a&gt; and lawsuits. And as the bad press continues, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;Meta executives have argued&lt;/a&gt; that the documents were cherry-picked to smear the company and paint an incomplete story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfjTKe"&gt;While the documents Haugen leaked haven’t yet caused Meta to make meaningful changes to its products, they’ve already left a lasting mark on how the world’s largest social network operates, particularly in its research and Integrity divisions. Ten of the 70 preapproved talks presented at the internal research summit a couple of weeks ago received a second, more stringent review to minimize leak risk. Senior leaders, including policy and communications chief Nick Clegg, have in recent months slowed the release of Integrity research internally, asking for reports to be reviewed again before they’re shared even in private groups. In some cases, researchers have been told to make clear what is defensible by data in their work and what is opinion, and that their projects will need to be cleared by more managers before work begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F2UBYv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Last month, Meta rolled out a new “Integrity Umbrella” system designed to thwart leakers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vjMDGf"&gt;Last month, Meta rolled out a new “Integrity Umbrella” system designed to thwart leakers. The Umbrella maintains a list of employees in Integrity and gives them automatic access to join private Integrity groups in Workplace, the internal version of Facebook used by employees. When it was introduced, several employees internally pointed out that the system wouldn’t have stopped Haugen, since she worked in the Integrity division when she gathered the leaked documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Exl3Ts"&gt;It’s not just the Integrity division that is locking down access to Workplace groups. The change has become so widespread that it recently prompted the creation of a dedicated group in Workplace titled “Examples of Meta Culture trending towards ‘Closed,’” where employees across the company post screenshots of previously open groups they belong to being set to private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJQxKt"&gt;This story is based on conversations with current and former Meta employees and internal Workplace posts from the past month obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; In response to this story, Meta confirmed that the company was making changes to internal communication. “Since earlier this year, we have been talking about the right model of information sharing for the company, balancing openness with sharing relevant information and maintaining focus,” said Mavis Jones, a Meta spokesperson. “This is a work in progress and we are committed to an open culture for the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EcUgpa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture shift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1E8SOz"&gt;One of the core company values shared with new employees who join Meta is “Be Open.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIwF9l"&gt;“Informed people make better decisions and make a greater impact — so we work hard to ensure that everyone at Facebook can access as much information about the company as possible,” its &lt;a href="https://www.facebookcareers.com/facebook-life/"&gt;recruiting website&lt;/a&gt; reads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpjnRW"&gt;The philosophy comes directly from Mark Zuckerberg, who, until around 2016, would regularly share sensitive information with all employees during a weekly town hall — the contents of which would rarely, if ever, leak. Facebook — now Meta — has been unusually open internally, especially by Silicon Valley standards where companies like Apple preach a culture of secrecy. One former employee with a long history of working in tech marveled to me when he joined Meta’s consumer hardware group and saw detailed product roadmaps for unannounced products in which he wasn’t involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htrdWu"&gt;You barely have to read the news nowadays to know that Meta has become perhaps the leakiest and most scrutinized company in the world. Many of the leaks stem from the historically free-flowing access employees have to Workplace, which behaves like a more sanitized version of the real Facebook with a similar penchant for making things go viral. At the same time, the company’s headcount has continued to grow steadily: over 68,000 people now work at Meta full-time, up from 17,000 people at the end of 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Phvirh"&gt;It’s within that context that Andrew Bosworth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22752986/meta-facebook-andrew-bosworth-interview-metaverse-vr-ar"&gt;one of Meta’s most powerful executives&lt;/a&gt;, wrote to employees one morning in late October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMRskF"&gt;“‘Be Open’ is one of our company values and I like to think that in my 15 years here I have lived up to that, if not even helped shape it somewhat,” he wrote in an internal post that was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps it’s no surprise then that I am getting a lot of questions about my feelings as we reconsider how we manage information internally.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUzUJj"&gt;A close confidant of Zuckerberg, Bosworth is seen by many as a cultural torchbearer inside of Meta. A &lt;a href="https://boz.com"&gt;prolific&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes controversial writer, he has personally &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data#.upw3jdyR8"&gt;been the subject of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/facebook-andrew-bosworth-memo.html"&gt;numerous leaked memos&lt;/a&gt; over the years. And with his recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;promotion to chief technology officer&lt;/a&gt;, he is now over the division that makes Workplace and sells it to other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pXo7LO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Serendipitous discovery of information internally is not the value for us it once was”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFykc"&gt;“I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we also have lost some of the good faith that once bound us as well,” Bosworth wrote in the post titled “Information and Effort.” “But even without the consideration, serendipitous discovery of information internally is not the value for us it once was. Not only because the cost has gone up but because the value has gone down as the odds of stumbling on useful information diminish.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH86KA"&gt;For many, Bosworth’s comments crystalized the reasoning behind the tightening of access to Workplace groups across the company: the employee base has grown too large to make the openness worth it. And even though Bosworth said in the comments that it wasn’t a response to a specific leak, it was clear the last few months of scandals had accelerated the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIPTZJ"&gt;In Integrity, the new Umbrella tool created last month tries to strike a balance. It’s essentially a master list of employees in the Integrity organization, which now numbers just over 6,000, and people from related departments based on the company’s org structure, according to documents seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re on the list, you are automatically approved to join a private Integrity group in Workplace for something like, say, combating fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JLB3I"&gt;“The Umbrella encourages open collaboration while maintaining access to closed groups to individuals who work on Integrity issues as part of their day to day work,” one of the documents read. Others who need access to an Integrity group for a specific reason can request it through a specific form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FwC0IN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it’s totally prudent and I think it will have a negative consequence for decision making”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHyeW1"&gt;Matt Perault, a former policy director for Facebook for almost nine years and current professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, thinks that the policy is long overdue. But he also said there could be negative side effects, since fewer people will have access to information that could make them better at their jobs. “I think it’s totally prudent and I think it will have a negative consequence for decision making,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvAFcc"&gt;Employees in Meta’s Integrity org agree. I looked through dozens of comments on a Workplace post from last month announcing the shift to closed groups in Integrity — news that was earlier reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/technology/facebook-workplace-transparency-leaks.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The overwhelming majority of commenters disapproved of the move to make Integrity groups private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yt2OYh"&gt;“This is [an] extremely worrisome decision,” wrote one senior engineer in the comments. “As someone who has worked both inside and outside of Integrity, I commonly see the lack of understanding of the Integrity space and challenges by the rest of the company. It hinders our efforts of building safe products with integrity by design. Sandboxing and isolating integrity discussions will further widen that empathy gap and could ultimately harm our users in the long run.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmHrBv"&gt;Others in the comments worried that walling off Integrity discussions on Workplace will marginalize the work and make it harder to collaborate with colleagues in other departments. Several made the point that the change could have the opposite of its intended effect by encouraging more leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDCCXI"&gt;“This could have a serious impact on employee satisfaction,” another engineer added, “and possibly lead to more leaks from disillusioned employees who have an incomplete view of FB’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcYQdN"&gt;You can read Bosworth’s full internal post from Oct 20th below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VWYCLz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVT0AN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.”&lt;/em&gt; - Stuart Brand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUM6hS"&gt;I have written more than a few essays on the importance of open and effective communication. “Be Open” is one of our company values and I like to think that in my 15 years here I have lived up to that, if not even helped shape it somewhat. Perhaps it’s no surprise then that I am getting a lot of questions about my feelings as we reconsider how we manage information internally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmCZG3"&gt;A few years ago I wrote (in response to leaks) that those of us who communicate internally need to take care not to write less but rather to write more. As our audience grows and the threat of context collapse looms we must take care to write with complete context. The extra effort required is a natural impediment to the frequency and candor of communication but one I continue to encourage people to work through. I still believe this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCTH41"&gt;But communication is a two way street and today I want to talk about the other side of the coin. While most of my writing has gone into the art and importance of communicating, that is only half the story. There is also an art to gathering information. Each of us brings our own context (or lack thereof) to everything we stumble across and as the company grows we naturally have less of a shared understanding. We often may not even have sufficient context to ask the right question. And our misunderstanding can easily compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3KWVF"&gt;I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we also have lost some of the good faith that once bound us as well. But even without the consideration, serendipitous discovery of information internally is not the value for us it once was. Not only because the cost has gone up but because the value has gone down as the odds of stumbling on useful information diminish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bam7Zr"&gt;If my previous advice in response to leaks is to be more intentional when writing, my current advice is that we must insist people be more intentional when reading. But reading and writing require asymmetric effort and so to accomplish that goal I believe we must manage our information more carefully. I would be disappointed if well-meaning people could not get access to information which had a legitimate chance of improving their work, but I don’t consider requesting access to such information to be too high a bar any more than I consider asking people to write more clearly to be too high a bar. These are the natural consequences of our scale and importance and to deny them would be to stick our head in the sand in an act of wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EN3uBT"&gt;If Nothing at Facebook is Someone Else’s Problem then the problem of widespread context collapse belongs to all of us. I believe a culture can Be Open without access to information being entirely unfettered. We already have plenty of proof of that internally as there have always been areas where information was not shared broadly (matters of employment, of personnel, of acquisitions, etc…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLp44V"&gt;Closed groups simply don’t need as much context to be added to each post because people in these groups already share more. It is precisely to avoid the overlap between people without sufficient context and content without sufficient context. I think focusing our information ecosystems even has a chance of returning to us some of that serendipitous information discovery we once had. The chance that a random post from another group is useful to me is low and its presence crowds out some content that is closer to home and might actually make a difference to my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlC4lL"&gt;Those that want or need more information should be able to get it, provided it isn’t a category akin to the ones listed above. It will just take more effort. And in exchange I hope our internal dialogues are filled with more context and some of the burden of being pitch perfect can be shifted off of our authors. Because the alternative to this is that everything is open but nobody is talking. And that would be much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
