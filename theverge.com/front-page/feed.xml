One UI 3.0 has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505517/samsung-one-ui-3-0-s20-plus-ultra-android-11-update-t-mobile"&gt;in public beta&lt;/a&gt; for the last two months, but this marks the official release of the final software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXcBJ7"&gt;One UI 3.0 has the messaging, notifications and security features of Android 11, along with some add-ons specific to One UI. Samsung has added easier ways to access widgets, take screenshots, and double-tap the screen to put your phone to sleep, to name a few, but if you want a more exhaustive list of all of the One UI 3.0 changes, you can check out this &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/17/heres-absolutely-every-new-thing-in-samsung-oneui-3-0/"&gt;roundup at &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="54sOyC"&gt;Outside the US, the international launch of One UI 3.0 also seems to be spinning up as well. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; says that &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/02/samsung-shares-timeline-for-international-release-of-one-ui-3-0-for-galaxy-phones/"&gt;Samsung sent a full schedule of release dates&lt;/a&gt; to users in Egypt, with the flagship S20 line receiving Android 11 and One UI 3.0 some time in December, though after the US. According to the schedule, the next phones to receive the update will be the Note 20, Z Fold, Note 10, and S10 phones in January 2021. The update will take some time to hit every Samsung phone that supports it you’re using a Galaxy A10, A20 or A30S, don’t expect to see it before August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dvb3sE"&gt;When we reviewed Android 11 in September, we appreciated all its added features for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;managing the complexity of modern Android phones&lt;/a&gt;, but noted the possibility for fragmentation, as Google and Samsung’s takes on Android have started to diverge yet again. Samsung was known for taking a long time to release updates, like when it took five whole months to send out Android Pie. But that’s changed over the years as it’s gotten better at managing its timeline. Last year’s Android 10 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21025221/android-10-samsung-galaxy-s10-availability-att-sprint-t-mobile-verizon-xfinity-mobile-one-ui"&gt;took three months to hit the first phones&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s what we’re seeing with Android 11 this year too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeAGu7"&gt;Issues like fragmentation are important because Samsung is the largest smartphone vendor globally, and the largest producer of Android phones in the US. That means the widespread adoption of new features largely relies on the company choosing to include them in new versions of One UI. From our early preview, it seems like the most important bits of Android 11 have made it into One UI 3.0; but when it comes to Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;other Android projects&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung might not have as much to gain. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’ve got an older iPhone, your FaceTime calls just got better </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of the iPhone with the FaceTime icon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xku19RnwtvfwXXAxhGVSoI4i50M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68446757/DSCF2931.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dsj7Hh"&gt;When Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21547652/ios-14-2-available-now-download-new-emoji-wallpaper-airplay-2-iphone-ipad-update"&gt;iOS 14.2 last month&lt;/a&gt;, it didn’t mention that FaceTime calls would now be in 1080p for older iPhones. &lt;a href="https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2020/12/01/iphones-8-e-mais-recentes-agora-suportam-facetime-hd-1080p/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;MacMagazine &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has updated the product &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone%2Fcompare%2F%3Fdevice1%3Diphone8%26device2%3DiphoneXR%26device3%3Diphone11pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149428%2Fiphone-facetime-1080p-facetime-hd-iphone8-ios-14-2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comparison pages&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhones 8, X, XR, XS, SE, and 11 (including the Max and Pro versions) to show that they now support FaceTime at 1080p over Wi-Fi, as opposed to before when they only supported 720p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5O5KJ"&gt;Calls made over cellular will still be at the lower resolution, but if you’re FaceTiming over Wi-Fi you may notice increased clarity after the update. That is, unless both callers had the iPhone 12, which has had 1080p FaceTime calls from the start (including over cellular if you’re on 5G). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9InA3"&gt;My sister has an iPhone 8 with the update, so I called her up on FaceTime. I had her take a screenshot when we were calling over Wi-Fi, then had her switch to cellular and take another screenshot for comparison. For good measure, I also took screenshots on my iPhone 12 Mini to compare what it looked like on my end. You can judge for yourself if you can notice any differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AWS275"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10199176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kUiwK2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10199183"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrJaS"&gt;I’ve worked in video all my life, and the difference between the two is pretty striking to me, at least on her end. On my end the difference is a little noticeable, but I don’t think I’d be able to tell at a glance if the video coming from her phone was in full HD. Part of this could be that, while her phone is streaming to me at an increased resolution, the iPhone 8 still has the 7MP FaceTime camera, as opposed to the 12MP camera found on the iPhone 11 and later. Of course, whether you see a difference depends on how sensitive you are to changes in video quality, or how good your eyesight is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the iOS 14.2 changelog that shows up when updating a phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2GL0rhRfMmcNFTpgl2vweiGfEcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140202/changelog.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iOS 14.2 changelog, with no mention of the FaceTime improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2DvHSq"&gt;It’s unclear why Apple didn’t include this feature in the changelog for the update, given that it’s on the iPhone &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-se%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149428%2Fiphone-facetime-1080p-facetime-hd-iphone8-ios-14-2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; and comparison pages. Nevertheless, it’s a nice bonus given that a lot of people will be celebrating the holidays over video call in order to stay safe. Mom and dad will be able to see the kids’ smiles a little better, and when you can’t be together you might be surprised at the difference a seemingly small jump in clarity can make. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now record footage from Ecobee’s camera to Apple servers, but you may want to keep their app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ecobee SmartCamera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Ip-buSprBFVdkoxGqRpyQlyWKI=/360x0:2520x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68446137/ecobee_SmartCamera_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A23RvO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/newsroom/press-releases/ecobee-reaffirms-commitment-to-open-ecosystem-with-homekit-secure-video/"&gt;Ecobee’s SmartCamera has received a firmware update &lt;/a&gt;that may interest Apple users who are feeling a little burnt-out on subscriptions. The camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;which doubled as an Alexa speaker when it launched this April&lt;/a&gt;, generally has the standard smart camera features: you can stream video from it to your phone for free, and with a $5-a-month subscription you can have it record video and notify you of any movement (or just human movement, if you prefer). But today’s update adds Apple HomeKit Secure Video support, and it may give you another, cheaper way to record and store that footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QveM5I"&gt;If you’re a little unfamiliar with the service, you’re probably not alone. HomeKit Secure Video was launched at WWDC in June of 2019, but so far &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-camera&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149216%2Fecobee-smart-camera-apple-homekit-support-firmware-update-subscription#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only a handful of cameras&lt;/a&gt; support it. Like Ecobee’s service, it lets you stream video to your iOS devices for free, provided you have an Apple TV, HomePod, or stay-at-home iPad that can act as a HomeKit hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOsZTy"&gt;If you want to record video, you’ll need to pay for Apple’s 200GB iCloud subscription, which costs $2.99 a month. But that’s cheaper than Ecobee’s service, and also includes extra space for your iCloud backups, Apple Photo Library, etc. You won’t have to worry about all that recorded footage eating up your iCloud storage. As a HomeKit Secure Video user myself, I can tell you that Apple doesn’t count the video towards your storage limit (though the service only keeps recorded clips for 10 days, as opposed to Ecobee’s 14 days). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyGsiv"&gt;If you already have a device that can act as a hub, $2.99 a month versus $5 a month may seem like a good deal, and if you already pay for extra iCloud storage the service is included in your bill. It’s a bit of a harder sell  if you also have to buy an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad, though. If you want to record more than one camera, you’ll also see less savings: Apple requires the $9.99-a-month 2TB iCloud storage plan to record up to 5 cameras (Ecobee or otherwise), which is the same price you’ll pay for unlimited recording on multiple Ecobee cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwRyq7"&gt;Before deciding to switch to HomeKit and ditch the Ecobee app, you should know that Ecobee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple’s Home app doesn’t support the camera’s ability to pan and tilt (other HomeKit cameras have the same limitation, too). You might want to keep the Ecobee app around for that, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fcameras%2Fcircle-view-security-camera.961-000489.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149216%2Fecobee-smart-camera-apple-homekit-support-firmware-update-subscription#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;or buy a cheaper HomeKit camera to begin with&lt;/a&gt;. I personally use Homekit Secure Video to manage my Logitech Circle 2, and it works well for its primary purpose: not having to pay an extra monthly fee to see what terrible disaster my cat has caused during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A night-vision image of a cat sitting on a piece of furniture with its eyes glowing and mouth open" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s51x83WIq2ybzwIdlZMwA_DuNNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22139878/IMG_0404.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lovely. Thank you, HomeKit Secure Video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Climate change is already a disaster to health, doctors say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FRANCE-WEATHER-HEATWAVE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EO1zBpxEg9fVTVmz-q7MPiLENI8=/0x0:7520x5013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68446125/1151828008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This picture, taken on June 25th, 2019, in Clermont-Ferrand, shows a personal care assistant holding the hand of an elderly person as she visits her house to help her to avoid heatstroke and dehydration during a heatwave.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thierry Zoccolan / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c52NdT"&gt;Dangerously high temperatures put hundreds of thousands of people’s health and livelihoods at risk every year, and a major new report shows how much the threat has already grown in a warming world. Among other alarming statistics, heat-related deaths among older adults grew by nearly 54 percent between 2000 and 2018, the report finds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVjObu"&gt;The sweeping health and climate change report was published today in the prominent medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report was produced by more than 100 experts from academia, the World Health Organization, and other UN agencies. The report offers proof that climate change will not only reshape life in the future, but it is actively endangering lives now. Health care providers already see themselves treating a climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9o9kE3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t want our health system to be overwhelmed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BNtFje"&gt;Doctors held back tears during a briefing with reporters when asked to reflect on the results of the report and how it connected to their experiences in emergency rooms as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world. “It’s been a really, really hard year,” said Jeremy Hess, an emergency medicine physician and co-author of the study, before taking a long pause to collect himself. “We see really catastrophic impacts that are very distressing to us.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197467/extreme-heat-waves-covid-19-pandemic-coronavirus"&gt;Heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; and other natural disasters were particularly dangerous this year, as emergency responders and health care systems struggled to handle the pandemic. Experts fear that climate-related disasters could similarly overwhelm hospitals in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IoZRi"&gt;“We really implore people to learn with us from our experience this year, and try and avoid the worst,” Hess said. “We don’t want our health system to be overwhelmed by climate change impacts, and we know what we need to do to stop this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PILJT8"&gt;The report, while covering a sweeping range of health threats from hunger to pollution, included brand-new findings on how many more lives have been taken by extreme heat. The number of heat-related deaths globally in 2018 reached an alarming 296,000 — and that’s just among people over the age of 65, who are among the most vulnerable to heat illness. China, India, Japan, and central Europe had the most deaths among older adults. In the US, heat-related mortality has nearly doubled for this demographic over the past 20 years, reaching a record 19,000 deaths in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uxFRks"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heat-related mortality has nearly doubled for this demographic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOB32e"&gt;People who work outside are also more vulnerable to heatwaves. Staying inside during a heatwave is often a healthier choice. But &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;working when it’s too hot outside comes with costs, too. US workers in the service, manufacturing, agriculture, and construction sectors likely lost $45 billion in earnings in 2015, the report estimates. Globally, people worked 302 billion hours less in 2019 because of scorching temperatures — 103 billion more hours than were lost in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fYeBI"&gt;Rising temperatures have also triggered more wildfires, which poses another set of health threats. Globally, the risk of people being exposed to a wildfire grew in a majority of the world’s countries in recent years when compared to the period between 2001 and 2004. The US saw one of the biggest increases in risk, with a 19 percent rise in daily exposures to wildfires. That means more people are breathing in more soot and pollution from the blazes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U4p9s"&gt;Fortunately, other studies have shown how taking ambitious action on climate change &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaau4373"&gt;can save thousands of lives&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t want to have regret that we didn’t do everything we could in order to prevent what we know is coming,” says Renee Salas, an emergency medicine doctor and lead author of a policy brief accompanying today’s new report. “That’s why we’re pleading [with people] to listen to the science. Let the science guide us, and prevent the most catastrophic outcomes that could lie ahead if we don’t do something.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google News will allow free access to paywalled articles from news sites</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tw72pU"&gt;As part of its $1 billion investment in partnerships with news publishers, Google will start paying for some paywalled content for its News Showcase program. News Showcase, a new addition to Google News that &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;launched in October&lt;/a&gt;, displays story panels curated by publishers — but its not available in the US yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zzcKT"&gt;News Showcase will “start offering people access to paywalled content in partnership with select news publishers,” says a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-showcase-expands/"&gt;Google blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Google will pay partners for limited access to paywalled content. To access that content, users will still have to register with the individual publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDGk8r"&gt;Users in the US shouldn’t get too excited about free articles just yet. Google lists partnerships with publishers in several countries, but the US is not currently on the list. News Showcase went live in October in Brazil and Germany. Publications in other countries, including Argentina, Canada, France, UK, and Australia, have since signed on. “Conversations are underway in a number of other countries,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8I9G2w"&gt;Google also announced a new kind of story panel, enabling individual publishers to display curated lists of important articles of the day. These selections will appear in user’s For You feeds, as well as a newly dedicated area within the Newsstand on Google News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbSnxr"&gt;News Showcase was first launched for the Google News app on Android, and is now available on iOS. Google says it will be coming soon to &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/"&gt;news.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and Google Discover.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chevy Bolt batteries were catching fire, and now there’s a class action lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1KCypjGfvcw7L2cY-VIJ0WMXQCA=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68445863/aliptak_180919_2960_5226.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Liptak / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJRghr"&gt;A class action lawsuit was filed against General Motors alleging that the Chevy Bolt’s battery is “prone to burst into flames.” The lawsuit comes on the heels of GM announcing that it was recalling 68,000 Bolts over a malfunctioning battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xJc5O"&gt;The lawsuit, which was filed in Northern District of Illinois, claims that the Bolt’s battery is defective and dangerous. Specifically, when the batteries in the electric vehicle are charged to full, or very close to full, they pose a risk of fire. The lawsuit accuses the company of fraud, negligent practices, and “knowingly introducing defective vehicles into the marketplace and defrauding consumers across the country.” The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sOZzQX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Knowingly introducing defective vehicles into the marketplace and defrauding consumers across the country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOTTyx"&gt;There have been at least five incidents of fires involving Bolts with fully charged or almost fully charged batteries, the &lt;a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2020/11/13/gm-recalls-68000-chevy-bolt-evs-potential-battery-fires/6279998002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detroit News&lt;/em&gt; recently reports&lt;/a&gt;. Three of those fires are under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees vehicle defects. GM has found two reports of injuries due to smoke inhalation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;GM issued a recall &lt;/a&gt;for 68,667 Chevy Bolts on November 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MrCRc"&gt;While the investigation continues, GM said it has developed software that will limit vehicle charging to 90 percent of full capacity to prevent future incidents. Chevy dealerships have been tasked with updating their customers’ vehicle battery software beginning on November 17th to limit the maximum state of charge to 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wB3V5p"&gt;The plaintiff’s attorneys argue that the software patch renders the Bolt less effective. “GM’s only purported ‘fix’ to reduce the risk of fire is a software update that limits the maximum state of charge to approximately 90 percent battery capacity, thereby reducing the amount of mileage that these vehicles can otherwise travel on a full charge,” the attorneys said in &lt;a href="https://chimicles.com/cskd-files-chevy-bolt-battery-class-action/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GyeIfv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The plaintiffs also accuse GM of exaggerating the Bolt’s capabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ngk1VL"&gt;The plaintiffs also accuse GM of exaggerating the Bolt’s capabilities. The automaker says the Bolt’s battery capacity is 60 kWh, while the plaintiffs claim it is actually 57 kWh. The lawsuit was filed by Bolt owner Andres Torres and seeks to be certified for class action status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKvKx0"&gt;“We are in the midst of executing a safety recall on certain 2017-2019 Chevrolet Bolt EVs,” a GM spokesperson said. “We are not going to comment on any related litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSi1l8"&gt;GM, which owns Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC, is the latest automaker to issue a voluntary recall due to battery defects. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18659983/audi-etron-recall-battery-fire-risk"&gt;Audi recalled over 500 E-Tron SUVs&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first all-electric car, because of a risk for battery fires. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china"&gt;China’s NIO recalled nearly 5,000&lt;/a&gt; of its ES8 electric SUVs after multiple reports of battery fires surfaced in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lFK7"&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars, but the topic has received increased scrutiny as more EVs hit the road. First responders are even being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;trained to handle EV battery fires&lt;/a&gt; since they can’t be extinguished via some traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L4nTu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuDXwr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa can now intuitively switch between more languages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwrpMOXyUWq3zgDdop-w7uZ9Yv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68445707/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="43Soz1"&gt;Amazon is updating Alexa to allow it to automatically switch between more languages. The update comes after a flurry of small Alexa additions over the course of November, increasing functionality and making Alexa more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDorYQ"&gt;Alexa first gained the ability to automatically respond to requests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910086/amazon-alexa-spanish-multilingual-mode"&gt;in English and other languages in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. However, you were limited to only two languages at a time. That hasn’t changed, but now users can enable a few more languages in the Alexa app. Alexa can speak German, French, Canadian-French, Japanese, Spanish, US-Spanish, and Hindi — all paired with English. Additionally, users can switch languages without pulling up the app by saying “Alexa, speak Spanish” to set a new primary language or “Alexa, speak Spanish and English” to set up a pair to switch between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o345Tj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Alexa can anticipate “latent goals”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfh3rJ"&gt;Alexa has also gained the ability to respond to what Amazon calls “latent goals.” This basically means that Alexa can address requests that are “hidden” within or naturally follow an original question. To borrow Amazon’s example, if you ask “How long does it take to steep tea?” then Alexa can assume that the latent goal is setting a tea timer, respond “Five minutes is a good place to start,” and follow that up with “Would you like me to set a timer for five minutes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WeqP0"&gt;Besides these two major changes, Alexa has gained the ability to include Fire TV commands in Alexa routines. So you can say “Alexa, I’m grabbing a drink,” and Alexa will know to pause your show and turn on your kitchen lights. And to contribute to the ever-growing Alexa creep across products and services, you can now also use the assistant in the Amazon Shopping app to search for products and status updates on orders hands-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJTcqW"&gt;These are just a few of the skill-oriented changes to Alexa that Amazon rolled out in November. Echo devices as a whole have been updated, too. The Echo Frames are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575243/amazon-echo-frames-smart-glasses-alexa-loop-second-gen-available"&gt;now widely available&lt;/a&gt;, the Echo Buds have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21593991/amazon-alexa-echo-buds-workouts-fitness-tracking-wireless-headphones"&gt;new Alexa-enabled workout skills&lt;/a&gt;, and Echo Shows now have access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560891/amazon-alexa-care-hub-how-to-use-setup"&gt;Amazon’s Care Hub for checking in on loved ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQPK5f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zens’ new Modular wireless chargers offer a mix-and-match setup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EV0cRU2oc5XNEaUodWE6fH7QAsg=/276x0:1782x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68444637/Screen_Shot_2020_12_02_at_3.57.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSCSDt"&gt;Zens has a new set of wireless chargers out called &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/blog/zens-introduces-modular-series-create-your-perfect-wireless-charger/"&gt;the Zens Modular&lt;/a&gt;. They are designed to fix the rigidity of most combination wireless chargers by letting users customize their own bespoke charging setup to suit their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTbchn"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/modular-series/"&gt;Zens Modular system&lt;/a&gt; is divided into two halves: main stations and extensions. The main station (as the name implies) is the primary hub for your wireless charging setup and is the only thing that you’ll have to plug into the wall. Zens has three different main station options: the €99,99 / $121.16 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/zens-modular-dual-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Dual Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, which is a flat pad that can charge two devices at once at up to 15W each; the €69,99 / $84.81 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-stand-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Stand Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, a single charger that offers a stand form factor and can charge at 15W; and the €59,99 / $72.69 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-single-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Single Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, a standard flat pad that also offers 15W charging. All three products are rated for both Apple’s 7.5W charging and Samsung Fast Charge, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xGOY8"&gt;But while the main station hubs are relatively standard wireless chargers, it’s the Modular system’s extension hubs that make things interesting. Using a magnetic connector, you can clip on additional charging pads to a main charger, adding multiple Apple Watch or wireless charging pads as you need (up to four total). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mS3BNGHhwWo5SKbqBIzGG81ycr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138450/zens.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zens&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lIzaOq"&gt;To start, Zens is offering two extensions: a €39,99 / $48.46 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-single-wireless-charger-extension/"&gt;Modular Single Wireless Charger Extension&lt;/a&gt; block that adds a 10W charging pad and a €49,99 / $60.57 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-apple-watch-charger-extension/"&gt;Apple Watch module&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s smartwatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55EhhZ"&gt;There are a few limitations: only those two extension pads can be used as add-ons (so you can’t chain together multiple stand chargers or multiple double pads). The new chargers also don’t use the multi-coil technology that Zens debuted with its excellent Liberty charger earlier this year, so you’ll still need to make sure you’re aligning your phone correctly. The Zens chargers are also pretty pricey for what they offer, but the customizable system and sheer number of devices you can charge off a single plug might make it worthwhile for customers who want to be able to charge up multiple devices frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ad5h2P"&gt;The new Zens Modular chargers are available now through the company’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeSkbg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xkts7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8XELa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Living the full Cyberpunk 2077 lifestyle will cost you over $2,000 and your dignity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRndrtmITpI4hmn24HZtSnzzWvQ=/392x0:2486x1396/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68436226/Screen_Shot_2019_06_09_at_4.22.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5m7HvN"&gt;We are eight days away from the release of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cyberpunk-2077-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DJWBYKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but with all of the brand tie-ins for the upcoming roleplaying game, you could mistakenly think it was already out. Throughout the year, developer CD Projekt Red has teamed up with multiple companies to create a slew of cyberpunk-themed items from gaming mice to game controllers and, yes, even energy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xyH1RJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhW7dF"&gt;The target audience: people who love both the color yellow and dystopian motifs so much that they’d be willing to look at them, wear them, and even drink them at all times. The good news for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; fans is there are plenty of ways to show off your fandom, from the official CDPR &lt;a href="https://us.gear.cdprojektred.com/samurai-varsity-jacket-male.html"&gt;“samurai” varsity jacket&lt;/a&gt; to the profoundly hideous &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;-themed Secretlab Omega gaming chair. The bad news is it’s all inexplicably expensive — and, oh yeah, a bit hideous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geG8PC"&gt;A lot of these collaborations are very on-brand, I must say. They all have a futuristic vibe that could appeal to the right kind of fan steeped in &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner &lt;/em&gt;vibes and synthwave aesthetics — although I personally find all this stuff quite ugly. But it’s certainly not beyond the pale when it comes to video game marketing, and I’m sure there are plenty of people out there excited enough for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; to come out (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069016/cyberpunk-2077-new-release-date-date-delay-september-cd-projekt-red"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295705/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-again-release-date-november-19th-bug-fixes-balance-cd-projekt-red"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt;) that they want to go all in on celebrating the launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVrB8o"&gt;So I found all of the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; brand tie-ins I could because I was curious to know how much it would cost to be a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; cyberpunk&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In short, it will cost a pretty penny — especially considering most of this stuff is either out of stock, discontinued entirely, or limited units were made. (I am looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225642/microsoft-xbox-one-x-cyberpunk-2077-limited-edition-bundle-console-controller"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; limited-edition Xbox One X bundle&lt;/a&gt;.) Either way, here are a few brand tie-ins if you want to show your love for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bf2jLd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giztop.com%2Foneplus-8t-cyberpunk.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 8T Cyberpunk Edition&lt;/a&gt; ($849)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIm6POhP6g9mSdSLwVVZattZ-uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22007791/a7c1c366gy1gkb7gekgouj24mo334nph.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/3871046669" target="_blank"&gt;via Weibo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4XimQp"&gt;One of the more expensive brand tie-ins, the OnePlus 8T is a good phone with a 120Hz screen and surprisingly fast charging. The entire &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; theme is neat, and there is a subtle touch of striking yellow accents that make the design look interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9mDoUB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series#titan_2020-cyberpunk_2077"&gt;SecretLab Titan gaming chair — &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;($489)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SveDJmQSW-BSchpDVFn26OPhcUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137793/secret_lab_omega.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SecretLab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the chair would have been much cooler if the design on the back was on the front.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JN36dm"&gt;SecretLab chairs are pretty comfy (but very expensive). Still, you get a lot of bang for your buck. Though, to be honest, I think the majority yellow design makes this chair a bit off-putting and can really stick out like a sore thumb. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not the worst limited edition console design I’ve seen. I mean, at least it’s not just a big yellow block.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6sZ6kW"&gt;This is actually one of the cooler limited edition &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; items. At the time it was produced, there were 45,000 units, so this is certainly a rare find for its initial retail price. But that includes glow-in-the-dark accents, laser etching, and custom panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KkePAB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2FRazer-Viper-Ultimate%2FRZ01-03050500-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Razer Viper Ultimate with Charging Dock — Cyberpunk 2077 Edition&lt;/a&gt; ($160) &lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The entire design is a huge no for me.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FnlOGM"&gt;Honestly, in the right context, you could tell me this was a car featured in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; and I probably would believe you. To be fair, the Razer Viper Ultimate is a good gaming mouse with an ambidextrous design. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well these are interesting to the say the least.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bnOdK5"&gt;Oh, and let’s not forget the mouse pad. Yes, you can also buy a Razer mouse pad with a matching phone case for Apple and Samsung phones. This XXL mousepad will look very nice if you’re committed to the whole &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic on your PC gaming desk. For $40, you can get this &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcustoms%2Fpersonalize%2Fview%2Fcyberpunk-2077%2Fall%2Fmouse-mats%2Frazer-gigantus-v2-xxl&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;obnoxious yellow mouse pad with the game’s logo&lt;/a&gt; printed in the center or the classier &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcustoms%2Fpersonalize%2Fview%2Fcyberpunk-2077%2Fall%2Fmouse-mats%2Frazer-gigantus-v2-xxl&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;samurai skull over a black background&lt;/a&gt;. (I vote for the latter.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cDqIp"&gt;I am not sure why there are phone cases. Okay, jokes aside: I kind of like the phone cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0olQGL"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SteelSeries&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBVQ72"&gt;If you’re going to deck out your entire PC gaming setup with &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; as the main theme, you’ll need to buy &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Faccessories%2Fmobile%2Fproducts%2Farctis-1-cyberpunk-2077-netrunner-edition-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-4%2F214147.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQiAk53-BRD0ARIsAJuNhptsgEUF85DdiJ-97XuNzLZ0qwa1hPzp8lpwXgh9nmSy90BBmE6N3goaAtEeEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a reliable gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;. This headset would also work with a PS4, Switch, or Android but would also pair nicely with the Razer Viper gaming mouse I mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea8U0V"&gt;Also, I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; show you a &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; gaming keyboard. Unfortunately, the only thing I could find that existed in the similar realm of these other brand tie-ins was a Whirlwind FX mechanical keyboard, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwhirlwindfx%2Fstatus%2F1280221958521516032&amp;amp;psig=AOvVaw1wiESc8VAP_LWN3pWn7Xe3&amp;amp;ust=1607026423868000&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=vfe&amp;amp;ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCLCI4YuOsO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAN"&gt;it was only a giveaway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Pl88Ww"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://us.gear.cdprojektred.com/samurai-varsity-jacket-male.html"&gt;Samurai Varsity jacket&lt;/a&gt; ($58) &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/081ZsCKD8rRhA1jBdBiUQC-7gCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138011/42_base_image_0_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A1W4N5"&gt;I like varsity jackets. (I was a two-sport athlete in high school and a former division 1 athlete, thanks for asking.) Aside from being good winter jackets, they are also very expensive. Also, why is there (usually) only one letter on them? Well, now you can buy this &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;-themed jacket, which has &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; (count them) letters printed plus a cool samurai skull on the back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81FHML"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://us.gear.cdprojektred.com/cyberpunk-2077-backpack-by-doughnut.html"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 Backpack&lt;/a&gt; ($112)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8Wyj7WBjdFEgCTaFNf3W3Gb8K8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138251/155_base_image_0_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am very surprised this is not a banana yellow backpack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DD78Y7"&gt;Keeping with the “back to school” vibe, here’s a &lt;a href="https://us.gear.cdprojektred.com/cyberpunk-2077-backpack-by-doughnut.html"&gt;$112 backpack&lt;/a&gt; that also has &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. Looks like a very spacious backpack; wonder how many &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; gaming mice could I put in here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HKq9rU"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WINTERSUNNY-Cyberpunk-Filters-Adjustable-Elastic/dp/B08NJXX53L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Cyberpunk+2077&amp;amp;qid=1606940413&amp;amp;s=apparel&amp;amp;sr=1-101&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=700923852f1b0c1e46ad75c7d84fcef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 Face Mask&lt;/a&gt; ($13)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yes, you can even show your &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; love through a face mask.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Us5xXs"&gt;If you can, stay inside as much as possible. But if you do decide to go outside, remember to wear your face mask. If you really want people to know you like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WINTERSUNNY-Cyberpunk-Filters-Adjustable-Elastic/dp/B08NJXX53L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Cyberpunk+2077&amp;amp;qid=1606940413&amp;amp;s=apparel&amp;amp;sr=1-101&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=700923852f1b0c1e46ad75c7d84fcef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$13 cover you can wear on your face&lt;/a&gt; while you do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liJX23"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rockstar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gotta unlock all these digital rewards sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lmp4uc"&gt;Certain Rockstar Energy drink cans have &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; printed, and if you go to the Rockstar Energy drink website to enter the code on your can, you can use it to unlock digital rewards and entries for other prizes like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; swag, or if you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lucky a &lt;a href="https://2077.rockstarenergy.com/static/rewards-car@1x-0ea44a3f8550b9de62ed35fcbb1dd4ff.png"&gt;1970 Custom Mustang&lt;/a&gt;. To increase your chances of winning, just &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRockstar-Original-Energy-Drink-16-fl-oz-12-Cans%2F383588927&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get yourself a 12-pack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neAEuT"&gt;Of course, there’s other &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;-themed merch you could add, too, but we’ve already got the essentials — and if we tally up how much all this would cost, it would set you back roughly $2,294. That’s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of money — but hey, if you like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; that much, who am I to judge?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Put Baby Yoda on your wrist with Vodafone and Disney’s Neo smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMPc4e_rqCPanLh6k1-Bc6sIAIA=/141x0:831x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68427783/Tablet_L_460x1844_TheChild.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vodafone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S11oSF"&gt;European mobile carrier Vodafone has partnered with Disney to launch a new wearable for kids called &lt;a href="https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/vodafone-unveils-neo-the-game-changing-smart-watch-designed-for-kids-and-featuring-iconic-characters-from-disney-pixar-marvel-and-star-wars/"&gt;the Neo&lt;/a&gt;. Vodafone says the Neo combines its technological capabilities with Disney’s entertainment chops to offer a wearable that gives kids a sense of independence while letting parents stay in contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUL28t"&gt;The Neo’s most notable feature is its Disney branding. The Yves Béhar-designed watch lets kids choose from a collection of “Sidekicks” that will hang out on the main clock screen, including The Child / Baby Yoda / Grogu from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, Buzz Lightyear from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, and Minnie Mouse. Vodafone says the Sidekicks will animate throughout the day, and the company plans to add more characters over time at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgVeLJ8M96k5GiI0TNnLACTmlzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137589/1300x910_uk.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vodafone&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the Neo smartwatch with the Vodafone Smart app for controlling privacy settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MgtV38"&gt;Besides the injection of Disney charm, the Neo is mostly focused on keeping parents in touch with their kids, with a few added smartwatch features (though all of this requires a Vodafone subscription). With the watch, parents can call, text, and get updates on their kid’s location from the companion Vodafone Smart app. Parents can use the same app to create a “circle” of trusted contacts for texting and calling and limit screen time with Quiet Mode. To boost kid’s “independence,” the Neo can also receive calendar updates, check the weather, track activity, and take photos with a built-in 5-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F012Ev"&gt;Wearables for kids are not a new category, and plenty of other mobile carriers like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Ftimex-familyconnect%3Fsku%3D610214661166&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fverizon-gizmowatch-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; offer takes on the idea. Even Apple has gotten into the game with Family Setup in watchOS 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21518711/apple-watch-family-setup-test-review-features-explainer"&gt;we looked at earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The problems with smartwatches for kids are twofold: parents have to decide how much of their child’s privacy they’re willing to sacrifice to keep them safe, and usually, these watches aren’t very great in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqWeov"&gt;Vodafone says the Neo won’t be released in Europe until early 2021, where it should retail for £99 with £7-a-month subscription. If the Neo’s specific Disney wrapper piques your family’s interest, you can &lt;a href="https://eshop.v.vodafone.com/uk/neo-smart-kids-watch"&gt;sign up for the waitlist today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
