    <title>Elon Musk says Raptor engine production is a ‘disaster’ that puts SpaceX at risk of bankruptcy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m6e0X8"&gt;On Black Friday, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an anxious email to his company’s employees, urging them to work over the weekend on SpaceX’s Raptor engine line and describing the production situation as a “crisis.” In the email, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Musk argued that the company faces a “genuine risk of bankruptcy” if production doesn’t increase to support a high flight rate of the company’s new Starship rocket next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ynuqw"&gt;The Raptor is SpaceX’s massive methane engine that will be used to propel the company’s next-generation launch system, called Starship. SpaceX plans to use Starship to take people to deep space, and in April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;NASA awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract&lt;/a&gt; to develop Starship as a lunar lander to transport astronauts to the Moon’s surface as early as 2025. SpaceX has been hard at work developing and testing Starship prototypes at the company’s test site in Boca Chica, Texas, though the company has yet to launch the vehicle to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lz1hCU"&gt;SpaceX is currently hoping to conduct Starship’s first orbital launch in either January or February of 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da3iF2Np51A"&gt;according to a presentation given by Musk to the National Academies of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; on November 17th. However, according to Musk’s email, SpaceX needs to launch Starship at least once every two weeks next year to keep the company afloat. And apparently, Raptor engine development isn’t on track at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MV7AoL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will be on the Raptor line all night and through the weekend”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XcPkSE"&gt;In the email, first reported by &lt;a href="https://spaceexplored.com/2021/11/29/spacex-raptor-crisis/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceExplored&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/elon-musk-to-spacex-starships-raptor-engine-crisis-risks-bankruptcy.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, Musk claimed that after key senior management departed the company, SpaceX personnel looked deeper into issues surrounding Raptor production and found them to “be far more severe than was reported.” Two vice presidents, one of whom worked on Raptor engine development, recently left the company, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/elon-musks-spacex-leadership-shakes-up-as-two-vps-depart.html"&gt;CNBC reported this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwiesf"&gt;“I was going to take this weekend off, as my first weekend off in a long time, but instead I will be on the Raptor line all night and through the weekend,” Musk wrote in the email. He also urged employees to come in for an “all hands on deck” situation unless they had critical family matters or could not “physically return to Hawthorne,” the location of SpaceX’s headquarters in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jm4JO"&gt;While Starship will ultimately be used to transport people to deep space, Musk also stressed the vehicle’s role in launching the company’s next-generation Starlink satellites. Starlink is SpaceX’s ambitious initiative to launch a mega-constellation of nearly 12,000 satellites to provide broadband Internet coverage to users all over the Earth. So far, SpaceX has launched more than 1,800 Starlink satellites and is currently serving roughly 140,000 users in more than 20 countries, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacexs-starlink-now-serves-140000-users"&gt;according to a presentation SpaceX gave to the Federal Communication Commission&lt;/a&gt; on November 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="dXG5Uq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we need all hands on deck to recover from what is, quite frankly, a disaster”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RI5vmx"&gt;However, SpaceX has only launched the first version of its Starlink satellites, known as Version 1 or V1. Most of those satellites don’t have lasers allowing them to communicate with one another, though recent launches have included this capability. Eventually, SpaceX plans to launch its Version 2 or V2 satellites, which are much more massive and will include laser communication. And per his email, Musk claims that Starship is the only rocket that can launch these larger satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RoONB"&gt;“Falcon has neither the volume *nor* the mass to orbit needed for satellite V2,” Musk wrote, adding that “Satellite V1 by itself is financially weak, whereas V2 is strong.” SpaceX filed an amendment with the FCC in August, proposing changes to its satellites with plans to launch them on Starship. In the email, Musk also noted that SpaceX will be ramping up production of its user dishes, which customers must buy in order to tap into the Starlink V2 satellites. Musk says the terminals will be useless unless the new satellites are ready to “handle the bandwidth demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asaEvA"&gt;It’s hard to know for sure if SpaceX is truly in dire straights. SpaceX did not respond to a request for a comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But this isn’t the first time Musk has called on his employees to rally and work long hours or risk bankruptcy. In 2018, Musk claimed that his other company, Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-tesla-death-bleeding-cash-a7928b06-3aae-43d7-bdde-5b9c41ef298f.html"&gt;came “within single-digit weeks” of collapse&lt;/a&gt; over problems with the production of the Model 3. Since then, Tesla has rebounded and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/25/investing/tesla-stock-trillion-dollar-market-cap/index.html"&gt;recently surpassed a $1 trillion valuation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyOx6O"&gt;Read the entire email from Musk below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ydKGRZ"&gt;Unfortunately, the Raptor production crisis is much worse than it seemed a few weeks ago. As we have dug into the issues following exiting prior senior management, they have unfortunately turned out to be far more severe than was reported. There is no way to sugarcoat this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JExavu"&gt;I was going to take this weekend off, as my first weekend off in a long time, but instead I will be on the Raptor line all night and through the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p23ENW"&gt;Unless you have critical family matters or cannot physically return to Hawthorne, we need all hands on deck to recover from what is, quite frankly, a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDTumg"&gt;The consequences for SpaceX if we can’t get enough reliable Raptors made is that we then can’t fly Starship, which means we then can’t fly Starlink Satellite V2 (Falcon has neither the volume *nor* the mass to orbit needed for satellite V2). Satellite V1 by itself is financially weak, whereas V2 is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdL8ew"&gt;In addition, we are spooling up terminal production to several million units per year, which will consume massive capital, assuming that satellite V2 will be on orbit to handle the bandwidth demand. These terminals will be useless otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mVgli"&gt;What it comes down to is that we face genuine risk of bankruptcy if we cannot achieve a Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huUjHh"&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkI1gB"&gt;Elon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qJhW4A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bans posting pictures of ‘private individuals’ against their wishes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SSFy60dTRIg5tnLlJ8TWAY0C1KM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209925/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C51KuI"&gt;Twitter will now let private individuals request takedowns of pictures or videos featuring them. The company announced the change this morning, extending an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18255238/twitter-report-tweets-personal-information-more-options-specific"&gt;existing ban&lt;/a&gt; on private information to cover media. It’s aimed at preventing harassment or invasions of privacy and includes exceptions for posts that are “shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shEQgN"&gt;“Sharing personal media, such as images or videos, can potentially violate a person’s privacy, and may lead to emotional or physical harm,” reads a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update"&gt;Twitter Safety blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the change. “The misuse of private media can affect everyone, but can have a disproportionate effect on women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities.” Twitter will evaluate complaints by the subject of a picture or video — or someone representing them — according to its larger &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information"&gt;private information policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XDaVdX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sharing personal media, such as images or videos, can potentially violate a person’s privacy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="euuGXh"&gt;The rule potentially covers all “media of private individuals without the permission of the person(s) depicted,” but the blog post describes several scenarios where Twitter wouldn’t remove that media. As implied, it’s not applicable to people who are public figures, a category that typically includes politicians, celebrities, and other well-known people. Twitter will also take other context into consideration, as well as existing rules like a ban on nonconsensual sexual imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoAT9b"&gt;“We recognize that there are instances where account holders may share images or videos of private individuals in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation, such as in the aftermath of a violent event, or as part of a newsworthy event due to public interest value, and this might outweigh the safety risks to a person,” the post says. It may also leave media online if it’s being covered by traditional news outlets. And it will consider “if a particular image and the accompanying tweet text adds value to the public discourse, is being shared in public interest, or is relevant to the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="igW3zq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beginning today, we will not allow the sharing of private media, such as images or videos of private individuals without their consent. Publishing people's private info is also prohibited under the policy, as is threatening or incentivizing others to do so.&lt;a href="https://t.co/7EXvXdwegG"&gt;https://t.co/7EXvXdwegG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465683094581792771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oAX0Dx"&gt;The goal is to remove pictures or videos that are fueling online harassment campaigns, although, in practice, its implementation will likely depend on moderators judging the nuance of a particular situation. It’s unclear, for instance, how Twitter might have ruled on a 2020 Twitter video depicting a white woman calling police on a Black man — an incident that was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/nyregion/central-park-amy-cooper-christian-racism.html"&gt;widely reported in mainstream outlets&lt;/a&gt; but only following a viral Twitter video and which featured two private figures but echoed a larger existing conversation about racism and policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcOXla"&gt;Twitter spokesperson Trenton Kennedy says moderators will heavily weigh the circumstances of a given post. “We’re going to evaluate things in the context in which they’re shared, so I would encourage folks not to draw too many conclusions from past instances or hypotheticals,” Kennedy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The policy will also require a first-person report requesting a takedown, not just a general complaint that a private figure’s image was posted. And Twitter moderators will consider whether the post was shared publicly on other social networks, not just traditional media outlets. “The general rule around our private information policy is that if this is available and easily accessible off of Twitter, we’re not going to take action on it on Twitter,” said Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSCvHd"&gt;This change comes a day after a high-profile shakeup at Twitter, as longtime CEO Jack Dorsey was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;replaced by former CTO Parag Agrawal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google engineers claim they were fired for following its ‘don’t be evil’ policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZkG-kJJQ0_312-YsbLNUSX8iSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209865/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5D4ct7"&gt;Three ex-Google employees claim that Google has a contractual obligation to abide by its well-known “don’t be evil” policy, and they are suing the company for allegedly terminating them for calling out Google’s “evil” doings, via &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/29/1059821677/google-dont-be-evil-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P3SnwA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Don’t be evil” has been a part of Google’s Code of Conduct since the early 2000s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3VYDi1"&gt;The former workers Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers, and Paul Duke were fired  — in addition to a fourth employee, Laurence Berland — in November 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/11/25/20982649/google-fired-rebecca-rivers-employee-questioned-work-customs-and-border-protection"&gt;for allegedly violating the company’s data security policies&lt;/a&gt;, however, they claim they didn’t leak any confidential information. Earlier this year, the acting head of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;National Labor Relations Board said that Google “arguably violated”&lt;/a&gt; US labor laws by firing the three employees, alleging that Google terminated the employees in retaliation for their activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1HLcJ"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21119310-google_complaint_filed"&gt;the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in the state of California, the group accuses Google of partaking in “evil,” and subsequently punishing them for calling the company out on it. The lawsuit states that at the time Waldman, Rivers, and Duke were hired by Google, they all signed a contract that included the “don’t be evil” rule. So when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805432/google-employees-petition-protest-customs-border-cloud-computing-contract"&gt;employees questioned and petitioned against&lt;/a&gt; Google’s controversial cloud computing contract with the Trump administration’s Customs and Border Patrol in 2019, they believed that they were in accordance with their contracts, citing the potential instances of human rights abuses at the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6aKQ2"&gt;“Don’t be evil” has been a part of Google’s Code of Conduct since the early 2000s. Although Google’s parent company, Alphabet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/3/9445453/google-dont-be-evil-replaced-in-alphabet"&gt;replaced it with “do the right thing” in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the phrase is still alive and well in &lt;a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct/"&gt;Google’s most recent Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, stating: “And remember… don’t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn’t right — speak up!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Qualcomm-powered handheld console leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HqSmR9d4k9ZAO_IxkJEW6LGhgYw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209819/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eWXUkQ"&gt;Qualcomm appears to be collaborating with Razer on a new gaming handheld developer kit built around its upcoming Snapdragon G3X processor. Leaked slides &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/qualcomm-snapdragon-g3x-powers-razers-handheld-gaming-console-snapdragon-8-gen1-flagship-soc-also-leaked"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; call the device a “Snapdragon G3X Handheld Developer Kit,” suggesting it will primarily be aimed at software developers and manufacturers to help them build their own software and hardware powered by Qualcomm’s mobile gaming technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bth5x6"&gt;Alongside it, &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt; has also obtained slides detailing Qualcomm’s next flagship smartphone processor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The name shows off Qualcomm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796541/qualcomm-snapdragon-branding-naming-scheme-changes-updates"&gt;new branding for its mobile chips announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. The processor will reportedly be manufactured using a 4nm process, with a CPU that’s 20 percent faster and 30 percent more power efficient, and a GPU that’s 30 percent faster and 25 percent more power efficient than previous generation models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PF90rX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="nl" dir="ltr"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon G3x powers Razer’s handheld gaming console, Snapdragon 8 Gen1 flagship SoC also leaked &lt;a href="https://t.co/hnqUxely80"&gt;https://t.co/hnqUxely80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— VideoCardz.com (@VideoCardz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VideoCardz/status/1465625575834456064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgBnlC"&gt;Other specs for the handheld gaming device include a USB-C port for XR accessories, support for DisplayPort over USB-C, a 6,000mAh battery, 1080p webcam, and “incredible ergonomics and haptics.” The screen is reportedly an OLED panel, with a 120Hz refresh rate and support for HDR. Wireless connectivity includes 5G mmWave, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2, and &lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt; notes that the device could be capable of streaming games from services like xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHe4bk"&gt;Qualcomm is no stranger to putting out this kind of hardware, which is designed to encourage development on the company’s platforms. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452710/microsoft-qualcomm-windows-on-arm-dev-kit-pc-features-release-date"&gt;Windows on Arm PC&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year, for example, was aimed at giving software developers a cheaper piece of hardware to use to develop Arm apps for Snapdragon-based PCs. The company has also put out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17145604/qualcomm-snapdragon-845-vr-development-kit-shipping-q1-2018-htc-wave-support-tobii-eye-tracking"&gt;VR headsets&lt;/a&gt; equipped with its processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4yEP5"&gt;This latest developer kit comes in the wake of the announcement of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, a Linux-based handheld PC running on an AMD processor. But Valve is far from the only company that’s working on the form factor, with others like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/7/22218956/lenovo-nec-switch-pc-lavie-mini-ces-concept"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;Alienware&lt;/a&gt; having shown off prototypes of their own (albeit with no plans for commercial releases). Qualcomm appears to be betting on other companies also being interested in similar devices and is marketing its processors as the best thing to power them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVgEzl"&gt;There aren’t any details yet on when the developer kit may be officially announced, but with Qualcomm’s annual Snapdragon Tech Summit &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit"&gt;currently taking place in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unlikely that we’ll have too much longer to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opOMl7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAfHAH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Taking an unconventional route to a conventional business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gxpy8B"&gt;Kat Norton is a Microsoft Excel influencer. She has over a million followers on TikTok and Instagram, where she goes by the name Miss Excel, and she’s leveraged that into a &lt;a href="https://www.miss-excel.com"&gt;software training business&lt;/a&gt; that is now generating up to six figures of revenue a day. That’s six figures a day. And she’s only been doing this since June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OTCoX"&gt;Kat is a one-woman operation, with no staff or management layer. She uses her iPhone and consumer software to make her videos, and I’ve got to say, she has one of the healthiest relationships with the social platforms of maybe any creator I’ve ever talked to: she thinks of them purely as marketing channels for the video courses she sells elsewhere. That’s a big flip from the traditional creator business model, which is usually aimed at monetizing the platforms directly. Kat’s just not doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWHhW6"&gt;But where this conversation really got me was when Kat said she firmly believed in manifestation and energetics, and that she draws a repeated connection between the work she’s done there and the success she’s had as a creator and entrepreneur. Just listen in this conversation how easily and quickly Kat can go back and forth between talking about her core business metrics and strategies and harnessing her energy to connect with viewers across devices and platforms. I have spoken to a lot of creators and a lot of executives on this show; I have never met one like Kat. If you’ve been listening to this show, you might have guessed that I am not the sort of personality type that goes in for energetics and manifestation, but Kat was convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t57LIM"&gt;I don’t want to give too much away because it’s all in the interview, but I think you’re really going to like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts3t5S"&gt;Okay. Kat Norton. Miss Excel. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rUlFBh"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5383938758" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybq4US"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smNGWz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kat Norton, you are known as Miss Excel on TikTok and Instagram. You are the creator of something called the Excelerator Course. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EBqqe"&gt;Thank you so much for having me. I’m so excited to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54dwHq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am super excited to talk to you. I’m going to start this interview a little backward, because I think the size of the creator business you have built is remarkable. What’s your revenue like? Where are you at per day, per week, per month? I’m looking at some of our notes and they seem like big numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7SrfG"&gt;When I first started the business, I scaled it within six months to six figures. Since then we have been doing six-figure months. I actually just had my first six-figure day a few weeks ago, which I was super excited about. It’s been just the most incredible, fun journey building this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="363eyX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the business? What are you selling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fKIYW"&gt;So I sell Microsoft Excel courses and now all of the other Microsoft products. I have Google Sheets courses as well. I’d say about 95 percent of what I do is passive income course sales now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbr38b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s all just you — you’re just a one-person creative shop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEm80X"&gt;Yes. I have a virtual assistant that helps with some of my graphics on Instagram, but pretty much everything else has been a one-woman show over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4FRYb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s amazing. You are using &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@miss.excel?lang=en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/miss.excel/?hl=en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as a marketing channel, playing your character, Miss Excel. Your actual product is videos you’ve already made that people are buying subscriptions to. How does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te8sbC"&gt;The social media channels are my main marketing. It’s mostly organic sales from there. I also host webinars that are usually those bigger, higher traffic days. I created lines of really fun courses. Each one’s around 100 videos. I design each video and infuse it with as much creativity and fun as possible. If you’ve seen my Instagram or my TikTok, you know I have to keep it fun. I also record everything myself so I’m bringing that energy into the videos. I also video edit everything myself too because for me that is half of the art form. For example, I’ll know I need to pop a picture of a hamburger on the screen for three seconds to make my analogies so the audience understands the concept. It’s where I go in with the teacher’s eye there. I create these courses — they’re like my babies. I make them from start to finish and I’m incredibly proud of them. They’ve been doing awesome on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYrYBX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you selling them individually at $5 a video or are you selling subscriptions? What’s the model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkULBq"&gt;I sell it by course, so price points are $297 all the way through a bundle of most of my courses at $997. People buy lifetime access to my courses. I host them on the platform Thinkific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQeXuh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why 97?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Rxe55"&gt;When you cut it in half, the result also turns into a nice number. That was something I learned from some business coaches — whenever I run a sale, it’s usually $297 typically, but when you cut it in half, it looks nice at $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfdTWW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. I love it. This massive business is just you. That’s so impressive, but it’s also very different from other creator businesses that we’ve heard about on this show, or other creator businesses the average person has encountered. Now, let’s start at the beginning: how did you become Miss Excel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxcXKl"&gt;Wow. What a great question. I’ll take you back to March 2020. At that time, I was working at a global consulting firm called Protiviti. I had been traveling every week before this, doing securitization interviews for banks. I had built out an Excel training course for fun right when I started at the company four and a half years ago. The company totally backed me and had me flying around the US hosting these Excel training sessions because I just genuinely loved to teach Excel. Around March, I stopped traveling and I found myself at my parents’ house in my childhood bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NdNVa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened in March?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hq0QvO"&gt;Some nice pandemic stuff going on then. I stopped traveling, essentially, and so I had a lot more time on my hands. I started going deep into inner work, work on myself: meditation, mindfulness, manifestation. As backstory, I was actually incredibly shy and had a lot of anxiety before starting this project. I highly recommend that, before posting yourself dancing on the internet, that you do your fair share of inner work and make sure you’re at a place where you can handle what comes with that. I dove deep into the spiritual work and got myself to this place where I no longer had these limiting beliefs and constructs holding me in place. It was April 2020 at that point — I didn’t create Miss Excel until June, two months later. This wasn’t even a thought in my mind. I didn’t even have a TikTok — I turned to my mother and said, “Mom, I’m going to be rich and famous soon so I need you to prepare your nervous system for that.” She was laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCfvZX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is very intense.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="tOhBh1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFjJTn"&gt;She was like, “What? Who are you?” I said, “Just watch.” And then I got this intuition to put Excel on TikTok. I didn’t even have a TikTok app on my phone at the time. I had so much resistance to it because my mental voice was saying, “You’re 27 years old. You cannot make a TikTok.” My gut voice was arguing, “Make the TikTok.” I ended up putting out a few videos, one per day. The fourth video hit 100,000 views. At that point, I hadn’t told anybody what I was doing besides my mother and my boyfriend. It starts getting shown to all these people I know. I’m thinking, “Oh, gosh.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X58TmN"&gt;By the sixth day, the CEO of an IT company reached out. He wrote, basically, “Hey, I love your teaching style. I’m looking to create training videos in G Suite products for students, parents, and teachers.” This is around the time during the pandemic when all the schools were going digital. I’m clearly a Microsoft gal, but I learn quickly. The spreadsheet products are similar, so I responded, “Sure. I’m game.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kc8KOx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I ordered a green screen and a ring light and set it up in my childhood bedroom.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4d3lZm"&gt;I formed an LLC. I ordered a green screen and a ring light and set it up in my childhood bedroom. I moved the furniture out of the way. I started recording videos after work and selling them back to this guy. At this point, it’s day six on TikTok, and I’m already making money. I decided that I’m just going to keep this thing rolling because I’m helping a lot of people — even though I wasn’t really getting paid off the Miss Excel, social media part of the equation. Within three weeks I went viral on a whole other scale. I looked at my phone to see that one of my videos hit 3.6 million views. I had 100,000 followers on TikTok. At that point, I asked myself: now what do I do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYVhsE"&gt;That was still in June of 2020, when all the rumors were circulating that TikTok is going to disappear or be banned — all that noise. I had all these people in my ear convincing me that my whole business was going to vanish, so I decided that I’d better hedge my risk here. I created an Instagram account and only 2,000 people followed me there from TikTok. At that point, I thought, “I guess I have to go viral now on Instagram, too.” This is when Instagram Reels were first coming out, so within a few weeks on Instagram, I grew 50,000 followers from a video going viral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivUrrP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you make the video go viral on Instagram?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfQnZD"&gt;I have some techniques. The way I run my business is different from a lot of the strategies you’ll probably see on social media where the advice is typically to use certain hashtags and make the content a certain length in seconds. The people giving that advice are essentially trying to take these concepts and frame them in a way that they can hand off to anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUFDC4"&gt;Instead, the way I run and structure my business is through energetics. I get my energy to a place where my presence is truly magnetic and I will get visions of what will go viral. Then I run to my computer and I make those ideas because essentially social media content is straight-up energy transmissions. You’re receiving my energy through the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVHbo7"&gt;If I’m showing up on your social media feed with low energy like, &lt;em&gt;[drops enthusiasm]&lt;/em&gt; “Oh, hey. Here’s Excel. Blah, blah,” with that low frequency, the video is not going to hit. I do things to get my energy into a place where, one, I get the viral idea, and two, I’m able to execute it in a way that people are drawn to my energy. That’s how I’ve been able to grow it to over a million people now across the platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3nT5U"&gt;At that point, I had no courses. I was just creating viral content. My social media profiles started blowing up. Around October 2020, a business coach reached out to me. At the same time, Morning Brew had reached out. The business coach told me that if I was about to be on Morning Brew, I should have a product I’m selling. To that, I thought, “Oh, touché.” I took a couple of weeks off from the day job to whip out my first Excel course, and started selling it on Black Friday of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ge7X7x"&gt;Then, by January, only two months later, the course was already making more money per month than my day job. At that point, I had to reassess why I was staying there — 401k, benefits, health insurance — asking myself, “How am I going to leave that?” I had another business coach who told me that I needed to quit and suggested setting a deadline for me to resign. I quit two days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8RTbo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was that the deadline? 48 hours?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcfUmJ"&gt;Oh, no, the deadline was two weeks, but I got hyped up! I just needed that big sister energy that Ashley Hannawacker provided. She’s incredible. She came in and asked me, basically, “Girl, what are you doing?” I didn’t know. She insisted that I had to quit, and that was one of my best days. Half of my securitization group at my day job knew about my TikTok and didn’t really understand the caliber of what I was doing. The other half had no idea. All day I was on the phone, like, “Hey, Steve, do you know about me on the internet?” It was a wild day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D56qZY"&gt;By April, I started rolling out a second course. I did my first six-figure month. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/miss-excel-microsoft-tiktok-instagram-influencer-six-figures-2021-4"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; had reached out for a feature. The whole Miss Excel project had been just scaling and growing. By June of 2021, I received the Microsoft MVP award. I also began working with Microsoft to learn more about their products so I could help my audience in better ways. The whole experience has been just incredible. It scaled to my first six-figure day a couple of weeks ago. I was super hyped about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TydZnc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you making six figures every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zz6sQi"&gt;No, not every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wf1R18"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you hit the peaks, there are valleys as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y14IWl"&gt;Right. I use webinars and I actually have one two hours after this call. I host these different high-energy Excel parties, essentially, where I come in and I teach a ton of free content. If you look at my page, I’m just giving away knowledge because my social media presence is what draws people in. That’s my purpose: to provide as much value to people as possible. That’s why I host these Excel training sessions and offer a deal on my products at the end of the webinar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKxvRY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that strategy convert to income for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1B40J"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvwcZ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a number of follow-up questions because you are a remarkable person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmCGvH"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqQmSp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with the idea you mentioned about having to work on your individual mental constructs before you dance on the internet. I’ve spoken with a lot of people on this show, and you are the first person to ever say anything in that particular Venn diagram. What specifically do you mean by that phrase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xizQkA"&gt;I had a trifecta situation. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with Joe Dispenza. He wrote the book &lt;em&gt;Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself &lt;/em&gt;and is a doctor who really dives into demystifying the mystical. I’m an Excel girl. I’m a Capricorn. I have a very logical brain, so I needed something to explain the woo-woo mystical realm in a way that my conscious mind could understand. That’s really where that book opened it up for me; I was blown away by the law of attraction. At the same time, I did a program by Lacy Phillips called “To Be Magnetic” in which you put yourself into a hypnotic state. Once you’re in that state, you are able to bring your subconscious mind forward through binaural noises and all different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdFFix"&gt;You essentially show your subconscious that there was another way during certain triggering memories. You’re able to go in and neutralize the electromagnetic charges associated with those memories. Those memories are no longer taking hold. From age zero to seven, we don’t have critical thinking skills. Everything that happens is incredibly more dramatic to a child. When I was able to go into my subconscious, I neutralized all those memories that were boxing me into making myself smaller, keeping me shy, and preventing me from showing up as my most authentic self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvQ0EG"&gt;That’s something I would highly recommend doing, whether it’s meditation, mindfulness — everyone has something that works for them. I also do a lot of Kundalini yoga, which involves mantra, meditation, and activities that get my energy moving. For me, that was a great tip. I know people who have done all different programs: one of my friends did 75 Hard to really get into those different habits and reprogram the subconscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTxDJE"&gt;Before doing these programs, I never wanted any attention directed at me. I wouldn’t even have a birthday party. I was so incredibly shy. Now I’m dancing to dumb TikToks about Excel functions for a living and I love every second of it. I feel so confident. That change really is a testament to the inner work and how anybody can really just take wherever they’re at and go into their subconscious and rework these things. You don’t have to take life at face value. You are a quantum creator. That’s what really helped me drive and grow the business. The growth of the whole project has been a result of inbound leads. Every press opportunity, every sale, every bulk order, every podcast — everything has fallen onto my lap, essentially. Then I take messy action and go after things. It’s really this dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTSv9c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In terms of thinking about how to go viral, you mentioned that you put energy into the world and think about how to draw people to you magnetically. That’s a lot of vocabulary. What do you mean by “draw people to you magnetically”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6qlYi"&gt;Think about when you watch a video: some videos make you feel good while others don’t. That’s the most basic way to frame it. I create videos that you are going to learn from; however, you are also going to have a smile on your face. I work on myself and raise my energy to a place where I’m coming across correctly on the platforms to make people happy. People want to watch things that raise their vibration. People want to watch things that make them happy and give them energy and inspire them. That process involves looking internally and then channeling that within me. That way, I can put that feeling into my content so the audience is not only learning, but they’re also having fun. That’s the name of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="z6HCQd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I work on myself and raise my energy to a place where I’m coming across correctly on the platforms to make people happy. People want to watch things that raise their vibration. People want to watch things that make them happy and give them energy and inspire them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3F7M5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think of your magnetism as a competitive advantage? There are other Excel influencers — it’s surprising that “Excel social media star” is a burgeoning category, but it definitely is. Are you thinking of your content strategy as a moat? Are you thinking to yourself, “This is me”? How do you think about that in terms of the business you’re running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jea61j"&gt;I just work on myself and show up authentically every day. I really don’t view anything as competition. We’re all out here helping people. We’re all out here on the same mission. What I do is really just bringing my own authentic spin onto what I’m creating and putting out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TAba6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the first piece of feedback where you realized that your strategy was working and that you needed to turn Miss Excel into a webinar business — as opposed to other, more familiar types of social media monetization? It doesn’t seem like you’re doing a lot of brand deals. You’re not selling Excel itself. You’re not doing advertising: I haven’t seen you endorse water bottles or whatever other people do. What are the things that pushed you into this particular revenue model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcGGbU"&gt;I came into all this because I wanted to create the life that I wanted for myself. I wanted freedom: financial freedom and geographic freedom. I wanted just to be able to do what lights me up every day. For me, the passive income model was the fastest way to get to that place. For example, if I’m not launching courses, I work maybe 15 hours a week. I spend a lot of that time in a creative state of flow. Those are usually the days that the most sales will actually come in because I’m in that receiving energy. I wanted to create a life for myself where I can travel. My boyfriend and I right now are digital nomads: every month we fly to a new state. I wanted to live and explore while I’m still young instead of waiting until I retired. This business model is incredibly conducive to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulmRG5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your costs? Did you buy a fancy camera? You mentioned buying a big ring light earlier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCUsbp"&gt;When I first started the business, I bought a ring light and a green screen. I use my iPhone to film my videos. My overhead, right when I started, was probably around $500 a month and everything else was profit. I hired an advertising company a few months ago, so I’m starting to get into a new presence — a few Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn ads. That has a little bit of overhead a month, but most of what I do is just straight passive income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6zkSg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also mentioned that you’re selling Miss Excel through a platform. Is that a contractual relationship? Is the platform self-service? How does that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akOREN"&gt;I pay roughly $150 a month to use Thinkific. It’s a platform that hosts all my courses and completely automates the whole monetization process: a client signs up, pays the money, and then that money goes in my bank account. All of that is lined up through the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qfdsB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Thinkific take a cut of those transactions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buIk1K"&gt;I believe they do. My Stripe payment processor takes a cut as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1USmmw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you get scale, have you thought about negotiating those prices down, or are you just not at that place yet? Other businesses will see, for example, that they are paying 30 percent of their in-app purchases to Apple on the App Store and decide that they are not getting any value out of that. Are you at that part of the curve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBL7aX"&gt;My Thinkific plan is the growth model, so I’m pretty sure I only pay a few pennies per person. Stripe, I think, takes 3 percent. It’s really nothing dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nloN2W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are just dumb, basic questions. Are you paying for Creative Cloud to edit the videos? What software do you use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAQEh9"&gt;This is actually funny. When I first started the business, I worried about how I was going to put an Excel screen over my head, since I had never edited a video in my life. At that point, I was still working 60 hours a week at a day job, so I needed to find the easiest program to learn. I Googled, “What is the easiest video editing software?” WeVideo is what I found. I watched a 40-minute YouTube video tutorial on that program. I’ve used WeVideo to create all my videos and courses ever since. I don’t edit on apps like TikTok or Instagram to avoid their watermarks when I upload videos cross-platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5R5tZ3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So is the desire for your videos to live away from the platform the driving factor for you to use another piece of software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x75rdZ"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETx7xe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To me, this is the heart of every creator conversation on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Most creators have a business that looks like the business the platform wants you to have: most Instagramers have a brand licensing or  partnership business, while most YouTubers have an AdSense business. You haven’t limited your business to the form the platforms would like it to take: you’re building Miss Excel independently of the platforms. Was that an accident or was it pre-planned? How did you get to this point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lOGpJ"&gt;That was the model I knew. I have a lot of business coach friends making millions of dollars a year with 5,000 followers; they built out these different coaching containers. For me, that was the model I followed: you create some type of course or product and you sell it. I’ve done a couple of ads for supplement companies and things like that, but they don’t make me money. They’re not translating — I just genuinely love the product so I wanted to work with them, but my audience loves Excel and that’s what they’re here for. That’s what sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Foj3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things about Excel and Google Sheets is that the products change. Excel releases new versions often, and Google updates a bit less frequently. A lot of the TikToks I’ve seen are about core Excel functions: pivot tables and changing uppercase to lowercase in names. These are tricks people don’t know about, but then they realize it’s very easy once they learn. That content is very grabby, but as you get deeper into Excel, the interface changes or features are added. Do you worry that you have to chase Microsoft’s roadmap or do you think your content is pretty evergreen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMe5gV"&gt;It’s pretty evergreen. Excel doesn’t change as much as you think. Whenever there are new functions or fun features coming out, I usually get to learn about them early and figure out cool ways to implement them because I work with Microsoft as an MVP. I use that knowledge to drive my content and courses. Everyone gets lifetime access when they purchase my courses and I’m constantly adding in anything new and cool that comes up, so my videos always have the freshest content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4XAIq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So people get lifetime access for a single one-time payment of $997, correct?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iT5pJM"&gt;It’s for the bundle. Yes, you get everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w24daU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of other places in this zone — MasterClass, Lynda, and the like — are charging a subscription fee. Why aren’t you doing subscriptions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sa0hQ"&gt;Excel’s a little different in terms of learning curve. A customer could pay $10 to $25 a month — then they could take my course in a weekend and be totally done. The subscription model doesn’t work out as well. For me, the secondary feature is the subscription-type feature. A client could learn everything in a weekend, let’s say. That person knocks out my Excel course. They really get it. But then three months later, they go to do a VLOOKUP and need to brush up on what I showed them in the video. That’s why I wanted to have it as an ongoing thing, as that added resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L3hufb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The subscription model doesn’t work out as well.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SqcHQY"&gt; I structure my courses in a way where they are organized by individual tool. So if you’re needing to do a VLOOKUP — boom! You can see it right there: 10 minutes, get an example, pop that in. But that system was a secondary feature that would align more with a subscription model. A lot of people just dive in and study the material, so if I had a subscription at a lower cost point, they could just cancel it after they learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VJbv5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that eventually you might add other pricing models or other ways of monetizing what you’re doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEiWO9"&gt;Potentially. Right now the price points have been great for the courses — bundling them in different ways. I also do corporate trainings on occasion, so I have higher-ticket items offered and I do bulk discounts for companies as well. That’s another area that I work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiKG8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the challenges with platforms in particular is the instability: one app might get shut down, forcing you to use another. The government might break Facebook up into a billion pieces. There’s a lot of that going on with the platforms — for instance, Instagram is turning into a shopping app and the grid is being disfavored in terms of Stories and now Reels. Do you think about those dynamics? As in, “I’ve got to stay present on the apps because they’re my core marketing functions, so now I’ve got to make sure I know what Instagram wants out of me”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KrtYs"&gt;Yes, though I view it from the lens of abundance. My attitude and thought process is basically: if Reels are hot, make some Reels. I look at it as adapting to whatever the platform’s putting out because it’ll allow me to have the greatest reach, versus having an outlook of being forced to do something or else I won’t be present on the apps anymore. I just flow with what’s there. I keep an eye out for trends and things happening, different apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u36iTG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you source trends?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QNjqR"&gt;Usually I go on TikTok and hit the sounds button, which allows you to see what songs are trending. Then I get myself into a creative flow state. It usually takes me about an hour to really get in there. I listen to the snippets of the different songs and that’s when I get the intuitive hits of, “Boom, that song needs to go with this Excel trick.” Some people ask how I match rap songs to Excel tricks — ”Drop It Like It’s Hot” to a dropdown menu for instance. But that’s really my creative process: I go in and I get into a flowy state. Then when I hear certain lyrics, I’m thinking, “Ooh, there we go!” Then I write them in a note on my phone and batch create them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ulcL7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your process with Instagram?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWVMJ9"&gt;Same thing — I’ll still use the TikTok music button, because a lot of it is very aligned across the two platforms. Sometimes TikTok has more music options than Instagram, so that always gets a little dicey, but I create content across the platforms. I started making content for LinkedIn recently. I created a Twitter and have basically no followers, but Microsoft tweeted at me and I realized I need to get on the Twitter game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rr8eT8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter is what poisons your mind in the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj9hwY"&gt;I’m a Twitter noob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAM1oJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just as little Twitter exposure as you can get is what’s going to keep you in that head space, I promise you. When you think about your marketing channels and how successful they’ve been, and now that you’ve hired a firm to do the paid side of the marketing channels, what are you hoping that they will accomplish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IG2m8R"&gt;Scaling. I want million-dollar months — that is what I’m aiming for. It’s really now just scaling on different platforms and creating different types of content. My ads are actually Excel tricks so they’re functional. People actually like and comment on my ads. They end up sharing the ad because they learned something from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0zNdW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you think about massive scale, one of the things that comes up with creators on this show a lot is burnout: if you don’t make the next YouTube video, your views are going to drop. If you don’t make the next Instagram story, you’re not relevant anymore and the brand deals might go away. It is a real fear. I’ve heard a lot about creator burnout. Are you at the point where you’re trying to manage burnout or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flryY8"&gt;No, because I just don’t view the world that way. I view it through a lens of abundance. The number one thing I do is energy management, and I only call in things into my realm that I can handle. I always feel comfortable saying yes to things: I know if an opportunity is presented to me, that I can handle it. I have a lot of techniques for stress: when I meditate, I come back out 10 minutes later, ready to take over the world. It’s really just managing those things. When I go a week without posting, nothing bad happens — I’ll just go viral the next week and my audience grows by 100,000. I just view it as though there will always be abundance there for me whenever I feel called to create. If I want to take a week off and go sit in the mountains instead, I’ll do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcdN0H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s fascinating about this is that, for most of the other creators I talk to — their product is their social following. Your product is not. Do you see that the distance between the two is what enables you to have this radically different perspective? The fact that your product is not your social following has enabled other things, so are you focused on making sure that you have a split there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLQssG"&gt;Absolutely. I just trust in the fact that I know I’m going to keep creating viral content. I had a video for the song “The Assignment” a few weeks ago, and it hit 6.7 million views on both platforms and my Instagram grew by 200,000 people in 10 days. It’s that type of thing where I just trust that I can do that, and boom. That’s a whole huge new customer base. As long as I keep myself happy and I keep myself in this state of abundance, I can keep going inward and getting those intuitive hits of what will go viral. It’s never a scarcity mindset. If I didn’t post today, my life isn’t over. My fans won’t be wondering where I am. I think some of them care about my life, but it’s a utility account. They care about the Excel content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHshUp"&gt;As long as I have videos blowing through the algorithm and I’m still creating tips and tricks — I actually find that on the days where I don’t post, I gain the most followers. I still have Reels going through the algorithm, and when people unfollow you, it’s typically because you appear on their screen and they remember you exist and they decide to unfollow. If I look at my trends on the days I don’t post, I have Reels being pushed out to people who don’t follow me who are now following me. However, the people who follow me already saw the Reel, so they’re not thinking about me. That’s actually a strategy I have for growth because you get fewer unfollows on the days you don’t post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0NhGE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I cannot believe I haven’t asked this question already. Do you track these things in Excel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIXCp0"&gt;Actually, they move so quickly that I don’t. I just flow because it really doesn’t implicate what I do. I still go based off my intuition. And if I hear a song, I have a hit, I’m not going to be thinking that on Tuesday I lost 12 followers so I shouldn’t post. I still do me, and that authenticity is what really drives it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3g6YgJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You run your business in Excel though, right? I have to know that you’re not a secret QuickBooks person on the side.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHvdN6"&gt;Oh no, no, no, no! I run my business through Excel, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3zPsf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Just checking. That brings up another opportunity: you can scale into other software, since there is a big market for training overall, but there’s only one of you — you’re literally known as Miss Excel. Sure, Google Sheets comes along for the ride too. Do you want to be known as Miss Outlook?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxsO0H"&gt;I have an Outlook course drafting in the next few weeks. I have courses for the entire Microsoft suite going on right now that are percolating. I’m in my creative mode up here in the mountains. I’ve been just recording videos nonstop. I have seasons where I’m in creation mode and then I’m in a flowy mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUTTcI"&gt;Right now, we are in Q4: going in, creating, building all these courses. I had learned things really quickly and I was also obviously very familiar with Microsoft products, so I really sat with them and just found cool, creative things to do. With Excel, I originally wondered, “Should I be Miss Microsoft instead or something?” but Miss Excel has grown into such a brand — I know people still trust that I know how to use the other Microsoft products and Google Sheets and all that even though I fall under Miss Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBQQJh"&gt;Excel is also just such a different program than all the others. Excel has a following. Excel has passion behind it because it’s literally just a way to build models. It’s essentially a freeform app where you can create different models on it, so it has this whole separate following. There’s just so much you can do with it too as compared to the other products. It’s wild. I’m always learning things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGg41e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the jokes we tell on our other show all the time is, if you look at any business and what people are actually doing, a huge percentage of businesses are just people using Excel. At the end of the day, someone’s got to use Excel. That’s actually the work, and everyone else is just talking about what the person using Excel is doing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYslja"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a big question: earlier this year, I had a guy called Kevin Roose from the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; He had just written a book about automation hitting the white collar workforce, and one of the big pieces of that is something called robotic process automation, which Microsoft actually sells. Robotic process automation is basically really high-end Excel macros that replace floors of accountants and consulting firms. Do you feel that a cliff is coming? Are you worried that the robots are all going to be using Excel in the future, not people who want to see dancing on TikTok?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0Pqyy"&gt;I think there’s always going to be room for Excel. I think the program will just keep continuing to develop and grow. It’s just going into so many different markets too. The Excel online space is something that’s been growing more robustly. It’s being used in schools with kids. I just started working with Flipgrid, which has 100 million students, parents, and teachers on it. I’m taking my Excel tricks there so people can put them into classrooms and start teaching these different skill sets at a younger age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j17Asv"&gt;I think that it’s always going to be around in some way, shape, or form. There will be people in the spreadsheets and it will just keep moving along. There’s cool things happening too: I was reading about different things with Microsoft Teams that will make that realm more virtual. I think it was called Mesh or something where they were bringing in their own version of metaverse-type things. It’s Microsoft — they’re going to continue to expand and grow and keep the customer base going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6irIfz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve said a few times that Miss Excel and your social media accounts are a utility, and they are. People love Excel. They want to get better at it. You make it fun. The other side of creatordom is your personality. You obviously have a gigantic personality, but that’s what most creators sell. “Come live in my life. Ride my G-wagon through the streets of LA.” That works for them. Have you thought about selling that part of yourself, about being that kind of influencer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdX0EO"&gt;Definitely down the line I want to really show people how I’m able to make and manage such a healthy relationship with social media, growing a business, being an entrepreneur — all while genuinely waking up happy every day. Part of my master plan is that I just want to blow this business up as big as humanly possible and then turn around and teach people how I did it, and also how I stayed so sane and happy while doing it. My overall purpose on this planet is to light up as many people as I can while I’m here. I want everyone living their authentic purpose — feeling good, showing up, doing what they love. I built a platform for myself through Miss Excel so that eventually I will be able to light some people up, because that’s what I’m here for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzyygW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you can do that without tearing down the wall between the utility you make for people teaching Excel and your life? It seems like your personal life is not on display, which might be why it’s a healthy relationship with social media.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yktx4T"&gt;I balance it a little bit. On my Instagram Stories, you’ll see me running around Sedona doing whatever. I get so many DMs from people saying things like, “Whoa, that just rocked my world. How are you doing that?” It’s been more of a behind-the-scenes thing, but eventually maybe I’ll just go viral on my personal page and start teaching these different things and grow that separately. Alternatively, I might integrate it into the Excel page and start coaching through there and helping people grow their businesses through energetics and managing your energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwPOPy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we’ve talked about how you have a healthy and important distance from social platforms. As you think about your relationship with Microsoft, they’re showing you the features — are you worried that you’re maybe reliant on one vendor? Or are you trying to keep a distance from all of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vdTDC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I absolutely love Microsoft.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r8n30O"&gt;No. I absolutely love Microsoft. They have been incredible to me, and I love working with them. It’s such a big company, so I’m always talking to different groups about different things. I also teach the Google products too, but I feel like Microsoft is big enough that those products are used in so many different businesses and that just opens doors in all different areas. If I wanted to do collaborations with different companies and work on their tools with them, then it’s all the same base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKdzZO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I talk to creators all the time. They all tell me that YouTube is the gold standard for monetization and for audience relationship. You have a Twitter, but you don’t have a YouTube. That’s pretty backwards in terms of what we see typically. Are you staying out of YouTube entirely? Do you have a YouTube plan? What’s going on there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBnXrt"&gt;I think I’m going to start advertising on YouTube, but for me, the course sales make so much more sense. If I was teaching my courses for free on YouTube, no one would pay for them. For me, it just made more sense to continue doing that instead of trying to grow an audience over time and get ad money on YouTube. I’m not saying I’ll never do it. I saw there’s new little YouTube Shorts and things like that, so I might look into it. But right now, what I’ve got going has been working so well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdJd8k"&gt;Right now I’m heads down, creating courses, creating passive income streams. If I ever get to the point where things are quiet and I’m in the mood to do something — never say never. I may dabble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgbVbu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube is another platform that can eat your brain, so it seems like you’re in a very good head space. The farther away you keep Twitter and YouTube, the better off you are. Do you think about branching out to the whole Microsoft suite — Outlook, Teams, Word, and PowerPoint? Or even other creative suites?  I’m sure you could be Miss Photoshop if you went for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0v8PGx"&gt;I love Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2kSbT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are only one person. Have you ever thought about when you might need to add another person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="og5Ez1"&gt;Yeah. I think it depends on where I want the business to go and how much it’s making passively. Building it into a full business is another whole area of time commitment. Having to be a CEO with all that entails, hiring and training people — I would need to really gauge whether that’s worth my time building it in that direction. What I have right now is 95 percent passive. Trading time for money is something I absolutely don’t want to do. I would need to have that vision and feel so strongly about it and have the right people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jsuluw"&gt;I also learn things incredibly quickly, so sometimes I am able to just pick up different skills. If I don’t know a certain skill, I’ll watch a few videos on it. At that point, I understand it totally and am able to teach it.  I would have to gauge whether it’s something I’m interested in learning or whether I’d rather hire someone and do payroll. I’d have to be more interested in it than traveling around, having passive income. I’d have to gauge which lifestyle I want to have at that stage in my life, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02a5Uz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think the timeline is for a decision like that? I’ll use &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as an example: we started with 12 people and management overhead from the very beginning. But as we’ve grown, a lot of us, myself included, had to make decisions where we’re thinking, “If we’re going to have 50 people, most of my time will become management. It’s either that or I’m going to have to let someone else do it, which is worse, so I’m going to choose to be the manager.” There’s another timeline of business growth where you choose to be the individual contributor for the next 10 years and that’s what your life will look like. Alternatively, you can scale it but then you have to do a different kind of work. Maybe that’s the new challenge. Have you thought about that kind of timeline?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ef1A2"&gt;Yes. I feel like I want to give it at least another year. The whole project is just scaling so quickly that it’s hard for me to even imagine a timeline, because if you’d have asked me a year ago, I wouldn’t have thought it’d be as big as it is right now. I keep collapsing timelines. All of a sudden I’m 10 steps ahead of where I thought I’d be right now, so it’s tough to tell. I’m going to get these courses out in the next few weeks and then I want to see how big it’s scaling. Really, if I’m ever bored, then I think that’s something I would look into. But right now, Miss Excel has been going so well that I’m just rocking and rolling with it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWnmYk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever think you have to circle back to the first Excel video you made, thinking maybe, “I wasn’t so good at WeVideo then. The interface has changed. I need to remake it”? Are you thinking about your videos on an update cadence that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaTHGT"&gt;Eventually I’m going to update certain videos, especially when new different features come out in Excel. But the courses are really cool and fun. Sometimes I go through my own stuff because I want to know what it’s like for the audience, and I’ll think, “Dang, I’m pretty funny today.” I’ll watch my videos and just be sitting there cracking up at myself, having a grand old time. I just made them less than a year ago, so it’s still pretty fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ9HHd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kat, this conversation has been incredible. What’s next for Miss Excel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9R9VW"&gt;So many things. Honestly, I can’t even tell you what’s next, because everything just keeps flowing with me. Short term: we have the rest of the Microsoft courses launching in the next few weeks. I’m super hyped about that. I’m really just scaling from here — scaling holiday season, Black Friday, doing it up, seeing where we land Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lndEjW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love it. It’s been incredible talking to you. Thank you for coming on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6t3iKe"&gt;Thank you so much for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0a7pa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals you can still get</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ze7vtmSs7kciZb6paCcl1Yo2a4w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209008/Cyber_Monday_Deals_You_Can_Still_Get.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agg4w7"&gt;If you missed out on a few great deals during Cyber Monday or Black Friday, don’t worry, you still have another chance to save big on some popular tech products. It’s “Cyber Week,” meaning that many retailers are still delivering some of the best deals of the year for you to grab all week long. Below, we’ve curated some of the top discounts you can still take advantage of on wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, phones, laptops, TVs, video games, and more. Take a look, and if you like what you see,  you may want to buy the product sooner than later. These particular deals could disappear at a moment’s notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGdVSU"&gt;If they do sell out, fret not. It’s very likely that December will bring some repeat deals, plus new sales because of the holidays. If you want to keep receiving the latest deal-related updates then even after this week is over so you can continue to save, subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="ybzbpN"&gt;The latest AirPods are seeing their biggest discount yet at Amazon. Normally $179.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re $170 &lt;s&gt;$150&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; right now at checkout. While we still recommend the AirPods Pro (especially at just $10 more currently), the third-gen AirPods sport shorter stems, IPX4 water resistance, and improved sound over the last-gen model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

This is the best deal that we’ve seen yet. If you don’t need a wireless charging case, the set that includes a case you’ll need to plug in to charge &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds-2nd-Gen-Wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-and-Alexa/dp/B085WTYQ4X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $70&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="Hm1y6z"&gt;Regularly $200, the Galaxy Buds Pro are currently on sale for around $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="2SWtbQ"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are available for $79 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value.

While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, their higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Procedural storytelling is exploding the possibilities of video game narratives</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRyuPt6PhldjqMkM_iCxwF3aqqg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209405/05_Unexplored_2_Early_Access.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer’s Legacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Authorship takes on an all-new meaning in games where the plot is yet to be written&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3FCgY2"&gt;Procedural stories in video games often induce a specific kind of delight. You’ll know when it hits — a realization that the code and algorithms of the game seem to be generating a coherent narrative from your own impulsive, seemingly chaotic actions. It’s what 2020’s viral sensation &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/8/6/21357131/blaseball-fans-absurd-baseball-sim-the-game-band?fbclid=IwAR3n5wfZoPUEICMrcvsvvlYW_AwLa3r3aJLTIgB-5Ld5ApBS3W54KA_Mi_Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and this year’s breakout indie hit, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22638600/wildermyth-review-pc-proc-gen-worldwalker-games-strategy-mac-linux"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; share in common — two strikingly different games whose reactive stories are nevertheless cut from the very same cloth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91khFz"&gt;Players have grown accustomed to procedural generation in a spatial sense. Just look at the endless variations of levels that define games such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the ever-popular rogue-like genre and the infinite planets that populate the virtual universe of 2016’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5856718/no-mans-sky-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But procedural narratives are a different beast. (Distinct, it should be noted, from pre-written branching stories). They’re slippery, simulation-driven configurations of plot, setting, conflict, resolution, and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ClkZu"&gt;Drama, as video games continue to prove, is harder to convince players of than space itself, which makes procedural successes all the more eye-catching — from mainstream hits such as &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; to cult classics like &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rimworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now it feels like this sandbox approach to storytelling is starting to bear even greater narrative fruit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCTIoI-44YC3iRTcryAET8Gruc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049847/Volcano_Fort.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvSuuq"&gt;If you ask game makers about the origins of procedural narratives, you’ll get nothing resembling a consensus. For some, it started with randomly generated dungeons of 1980’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1443430/Rogue/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; for others, choose-your-own-adventure books. Nate Austin, designer and programmer of tactical role-playing game &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;, sees procedural storytelling as stemming from tabletop board games like &lt;em&gt;Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; — experiences that provide rules and a structure from which a vast number of narratives can spawn. In his view, and those of more than a few others, 2006’s &lt;a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a management game about dwarves seeking to colonize an austere, text-based world, is the inheritor to this particular &lt;em&gt;genus&lt;/em&gt; of narrative design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plwseD"&gt;For newcomers, &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; can be intimidating. Beneath its mass of inscrutable &lt;a href="https://www.asciitable.com/"&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt; icons lies a fiendishly complex simulation. On a basic level, its world is filled with flora, fauna, foes, and resources, plus, of course, your dwarves, all of whom have unique personalities. Your job is to ensure their happiness by building a colony that can satisfy their various needs and, thus, ensure the survival of the group. You might ace colonization itself, but then, suddenly, a gigantic monster kills half your group, which means you fail to bring in the harvest. Just like that, the colony is no more. “It sort of naturally creates these stories,” says Austin over Zoom. “And because you’re invested in the personalities all along, the drama happens in your head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GbrfaZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With procedural storytelling, there’s the suggestion of a machine beneath the hood.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqJKyJ"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; and 2016’s &lt;em&gt;RimWorld&lt;/em&gt; (which self-consciously builds on the former’s legacy), Austin suggests this is the closest video games have come to the freedom of tabletop experiences — “theater of the mind,” as he calls it. The designer has fond memories of such experiences, having played and dungeon-mastered &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; sessions as a kid&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alongside his siblings Douglas Austin and Katie Austin (both are writers on the game). This narrative possibility is precisely what Austin sought to capture with &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;, albeit in a more accessible style than either of those two games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTwJX7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; begins, as you might expect, with randomly generated characters. At first, they’re humble homesteaders but eventually grow into battle-hardened protectors of the realm. Events happen along the way: love, rivalries, children, and death. The most remarkable aspect of the game is that neither the precise order of these events nor their exact form is preordained. &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; cooks up its story on the fly, and so while narratives follow a broad structure, they never quite land the same. Crucially, these characters are yours, so you care for them in a way that would perhaps surprise even the most curmudgeonly player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLhbeK"&gt;The game’s magic, explains Austin, is in its “alternating layers of handcrafted and procedural content.” There’s the grand central narrative with a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end — procedural events that stem from the combat and personalities of your characters; then there’s the comic strips (dubbed “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/A5BGDbLFRrE?t=559"&gt;Library of Plays&lt;/a&gt;”) that bookend each event. Crucially, these “plays,” of which there are well over 100, are written in such a way that the code is able to seamlessly incorporate your heroes into them. The game succeeds both on a momentary basis — by turns charming, funny, suspenseful — and as a larger work of fiction, ebbing and flowing like a classic fantasy epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqwe2W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth’s&lt;/em&gt; magic also stems from its approach to time. Campaigns typically last a century of in-game time, which means you not only see your characters age but the enemy advance ominously across the world map. Procedural RPG &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/unexplored-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (currently in early access) works similarly. Every time your character dies, time and the game’s foes march forwards, and in this moment, you see the game’s whirring systems most clearly. “With procedural storytelling,” says Joris Dormans, director of&lt;em&gt; Unexplored 2&lt;/em&gt;, “there’s the suggestion of a machine beneath the hood. You’re interacting directly with that, and in a way, you’re collaborating [with it] to create the story. I think that’s so powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErCvgH1YQgZIMW03FLGN9kksoiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049855/screenshot1920_combat1_ThrixlCave.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eosvty"&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2&lt;/em&gt; are products of what’s become a cottage industry of procedural storytellers across Europe and North America. Montreal’s Kitfox Games is both a developer of games like the wonderfully gloomy cult simulator, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/21/18188670/the-shrouded-isle-switch-pc-mac-os"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Shrouded Isle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a publisher. It’s set to release a visually updated version of&lt;em&gt; Dwarf Fortress &lt;/em&gt;on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, part of an ongoing collaboration between co-founder Tanya Short and &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; designer Tarn Adams. (The two co-edited 2019’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.routledge.com%2FProcedural-Storytelling-in-Game-Design%2FShort-Adams%2Fp%2Fbook%2F9781138595309&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F30%2F22807568%2Fprocedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procedural Storytelling in Game Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — what amounts to a bible for aspiring writers and designers in the field.) Across the Atlantic, Emily Short (no relation to Kitfox’s Tanya) recently joined Failbetter Games as creative director, bringing a wealth of interactive fiction experience to the studio developing the romance-murder game &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769980/Mask_of_the_Rose/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mask of the Rose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEIEbp"&gt;Short’s CV includes both interactive fiction classics (2000’s &lt;a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/emrhyy7pp0c8bjkjeuhs-g/galatea"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galatea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; asks you to have a conversation with a sculpture), as well as tools like &lt;a href="https://versu.com/"&gt;Versu&lt;/a&gt; (axed in 2014 by its proprietor, Linden Labs, the studio behind &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;). Like Dormans, whose work in video games stems from his PhD on emergent game design at the University of Amsterdam, Short has one foot in commercial game development and another in academia. She’s not alone — there’s a big crossover between the two worlds because studios are reluctant to fund costly research and development when there’s no guarantee of successful outcomes. Game makers often spend a few years cutting their teeth in the industry, moving into academia for research, before returning to commercial game development armed with a fresh set of narrative tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybGY6OSyB6RVA0P37UNlLOfw3uU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049872/Blaseball_Short_Circuits___The_Discipline_Era.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ysV9Lq"&gt;The major hub of this academic study is University of California, Santa Cruz, home to students and professors that cluster around its &lt;a href="https://eis.ucsc.edu/"&gt;Expressive Intelligence Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in 2006 by Michael Mateas, maker of the ambitious 2005 conversation simulator &lt;a href="https://www.playablstudios.com/facade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Façade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the work that emanates from the lab continually pushes the boundaries of AI and storytelling. Academics such as Max Kreminski are focusing their efforts on what they call emergent narrative, another name for the same kind of simulation-driven plots of &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt;. Over an audio call, they describe it as a “bottom-up” approach to narrative design — their job is to “find and bubble up” the interesting stories that fall out of the player’s interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrUYNF"&gt;One way Kreminski is attempting this is through what they call “&lt;a href="https://mkremins.github.io/publications/Felt_SimpleStorySifter.pdf"&gt;story sifting&lt;/a&gt;,” an approach that could give even greater shape, structure, and meaning to these procedural narratives. Think of it as the computer scanning (or sifting) in-game events to find interesting micro-stories — perhaps a lovers’ tryst or an escalating tale of revenge. These are surfaced to the player and then woven back into the game. The greatest challenge, explains Kreminski, is not in identifying these stories (he feeds the computer examples of what to look for) but matching events that have already happened with those that are in the process of emerging. If he can do this, these stories can be stitched together in such a way that they become a cohesive whole, a kind of plot-combo that stretches both in front of, and behind, the player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOv5uy"&gt;Kreminski points to a few titles that have utilized something close to story sifting in the past. 2004’s &lt;em&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/em&gt; features “&lt;a href="https://www.kmjn.org/notes/sims2_ai.html"&gt;story trees&lt;/a&gt;,” which recognize sequences of events and nudge the player towards completing them. Social simulation &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/impressions-prom-week"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prom Week&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;(which emerged from the Expressive Intelligence Studio in 2012) features characters that look at the history of its high-school world to influence next actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1qGVY"&gt;But perhaps the most in-depth implementation of story sifting is in 2020’s ongoing absurdist baseball simulator, &lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt;. Players bet on matches involving bizarre fictional teams (like the Baltimore Crabs) whose roster includes even weirder procedurally-generated characters (their traits can range from Shakespearian to anti-capitalist). The sifting happens in a few different ways, explains Cat Manning, narrative and design consultant on the game. At first, it was simply oral storytelling — players would have to see an event happen in real-time and then relay that to the community. But then, because the game spits out an eye-watering amount of data, players were having trouble keeping track — which is where the&lt;a href="https://sibr.dev/"&gt; Society for Internet Blaseball Research&lt;/a&gt; stepped in. The fan community essentially developed a tool to let players watch replays of past games using data available on the site, what Manning calls a “backward story sifting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGr3c2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt; now features its own “feed” on the site that surfaces important storylines to players, but a great deal of the story sifting still happens organically in the Discord chat. While most procedural stories occur within single-player games, &lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt; is a rare example of what happens when the scope is blown up to incorporate tens of thousands of players — almost like a mass hallucination. The deluge of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/8/6/21357131/blaseball-fans-absurd-baseball-sim-the-game-band"&gt;fan art&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://thegarages.bandcamp.com/"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; is a testament to not just the stories its spreadsheet-like simulation generates but the way we as players are able to imagine color and detail into its world, just as readers do with literature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hImrlRYWRVVpcMk_aqlA7trOkJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049874/ss_68697a274ce491c11d94c0cc94a213177945919c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4OmbCH"&gt;You might be wondering why major studios, usually so quick to incorporate such innovations into their glossy blockbusters, haven’t yet jumped on procedural storytelling. The simple answer is that the variables involved become infinitely more complex and expensive at such scale. Still, there are a few exceptions: 2014’s action-adventure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/1/6881161/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-torture-terrorism"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks your showdowns with the game’s Uruk mini-bosses through its &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/shadow-mordor-nemesis-system-amazing-how-works/"&gt;Nemesis System&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, the game creates rivalry-focused mini-narratives inarguably more enjoyable than the main story itself. There’s also the &lt;em&gt;State of Decay&lt;/em&gt; series,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which features a cast of algorithmically generated zombie survivalists, the first a great deal more successfully than the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtwPUQ"&gt;By far, the most ambitious blockbuster attempt at procedural storytelling is 2020’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/12/21319047/watch-dogs-legion-ubisoft-hands-on-preview-hacking-open-world-london-gameplay"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Its hook, the “Play As Anyone” system, lets you recruit non-playable characters to a crack squad of hacker-activists seeking to liberate a grim, dystopian London. Every single non-playable character has a unique background — occupation, hobbies, relationships, felonies, special abilities — all of which are generated by the game’s “Census” system. The beauty of the game lies in assembling this squad according to your own specific preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="69e4Hh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s already so many spinning plates.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BgliBr"&gt;While the “Play As Anyone” system is easy to understand, its implementation was anything but, says Liz England, team lead game designer, over Zoom. She describes it as like picking up a rock only to discover there’s an entire civilization attached below. Because of its procedurality, whole aspects of production had to be relearned — animation, lip-synching, in-game lighting. “There’s already so many spinning plates shipping a game like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Legion&lt;/em&gt;,” says England, “and then you say to everyone, ‘This tech you’ve been using, we’re gonna throw it out. This pipeline, we need to invent it from scratch.’ To make a game with a difficult concept to wrap your head around from a developer’s side and then to scale that to hundreds of people across multiple studios around the world — it’s very different to if you’re making an indie game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1fF1P"&gt;England, who recently &lt;a href="https://me.ign.com/en/pc/190473/news/state-of-decay-studio-founder-jeff-strain-starts-new-studio-possibility-space"&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt; a new studio headed up by &lt;em&gt;State of Decay’s&lt;/em&gt; Jeff Strain, says there are other aspects of indie procedural storytelling that big-budget games can’t hope to match — at least not yet. Take medieval power simulator &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/9/1/21417091/crusader-kings-3-review-pc-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crusader Kings 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which generates text boxes with information specific to your playthrough. That becomes much harder when it’s something somebody actually has to say out loud. “The whole audio pipeline is just very expensive,” continues England. “It needs to be done early on because it has to be recorded with actors in other languages.” On a broader level, procedurality, especially within narratives, involves a relinquishing of control over the player’s experience. Making sure it’s one that can meet the expectations of famously exacting video game players — well, that’s tough. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9K1e1LZZ2YGpNuurDa_6VpfWORQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049882/14_Unexplored_2_Early_Access.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17Kn3y"&gt;As it stands, the indie world will continue to innovate, both in terms of games themselves and the tools used to create them. Emily Short, creative director of Failbetter Games, is excited about “socially and culturally democratizing” the space. “Having knowledge and tools be accessible, and having new people come in who want to experiment — this is part of the reason I write so much on my &lt;a href="https://emshort.blog/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “Even if specific innovations that I’m working on go nowhere, at least I’m equipping other people. It feels to me like there’s a huge space of unknown possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lLyKIP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It feels to me like there’s a huge space of unknown possibilities.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FMi6xU"&gt;Others echo Short’s sentiment. Because of the high level of technical expertise required to make these stories work, studios tend to have their own in-house software solutions. At the moment, says Tanya Short of Kitfox Games, it’s a case of “everyone building their own weird engine.” But she knows of one developer who’s about to start looking for private funding to develop their own tool (inspired, she says, by Versu). “There’s a need for it,” continues Short, “because there’s an emerging vocabulary set, but it’s basically industry jargon. Without words to describe [procedural storytelling], it’s very hard to discuss.” Alongside such tools, the Kitfox co-founder predicts machine-learning will buff up the audio and visual aspects of procedural storytelling, from voice-acting to art, so you’ll have “much higher production values on all indie games but especially those with procedurally-generated content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp96ks"&gt;What’s clear is that procedural storytelling won’t wholesale replace straightforwardly human-authored plots anytime soon. For those worried about such a possibility, Short offers a thoughtful rebuttal. “That feels like it’s mistaking the pleasures of one thing for the pleasures of a different thing,” she says. Instead, players will continue to enjoy the sharply focused, linear narratives of titles such as those in the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;franchise while being able to play games that convey the unmistakable, thrilling sensation of co-authoring a story with a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sxwfMX"&gt;While the likes of &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; are part of a long procedural storytelling tradition, the field as a whole still feels as if it’s only on act one — the potential is as vast and varied as stories themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A dating app — not Facebook or Clubhouse — cracked getting audio to go viral</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e32VZC_GliwLdgInyzHUm5uUWV0=/12x0:2036x1349/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209305/Hinge_Voice_Prompts.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwbEzE"&gt;Hello! I’m back from Thanksgiving break and now have mashed potatoes for brains. Really, I’ve eaten mashed potatoes five days in a row. I can stop, but I won’t stop until the leftovers are gone. Anyway, in between mashed potato servings, I did my best to “log off” and not think about audio — no offense — so instead, I binged the entire new season of &lt;em&gt;Selling Sunset&lt;/em&gt; and played many crosswords. I’m back for you now, though, and we have a big issue ahead. We’re talking about how a dating app stumbled upon viral audio success, and I chatted with the CEO of podcasting’s latest $100 million-funded company, Podimo. Plus, an update to my RadioPublic story from last week and new Apple charts. Lots! Of! Stuff(ing)! On we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUzQSi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Hinge makes viral audio happen, despite many other apps trying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l46H4Q"&gt;Today’s main story is one best told in a couple parts. The first: Last month, the dating app Hinge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746297/hinge-voice-notes-prompts-profile"&gt;debuted&lt;/a&gt; voice prompts to daters’ profiles. Instead of telling potential matches about yourself with text, you could do so with your voice. Each clip can be 30 seconds, and, at launch, Hinge said two out of three daters it polled thought voice would help them “better determine their chemistry” with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xwRzd"&gt;Fast forward to now, and, well, voice prompts are certainly doing something. The prompts have gone viral on TikTok and Twitter, with people reposting them either because they’re funny, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DNA_Bethylation/status/1462668039049158656?s=20"&gt;cringe-worthy&lt;/a&gt;, or something in between. There’s impersonations, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaycesimpson1/status/1465166046323625992?s=20"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DJKZA/status/1462239099205472262?s=20"&gt;sincerity&lt;/a&gt;, and bizarre moments. NBC News wrote about the viral fad a couple weeks ago, which you &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/hinges-new-voice-prompts-are-tiktok-hit-rcna5663"&gt;can read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmoMGl"&gt;I reached out to Hinge to get more concrete data on how this feature is performing and whether going viral was part of the plan. The company tells me 13 percent of new daters on the app build their profile with a voice prompt and that 46 percent of people on the app have listened to at least one voice prompt. A slow build, but one Michelle Parsons, Hinge’s CPO, interprets as encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9eWAu"&gt;“If you imagine the amount of extra time that it takes to add any piece of information to your profile, it’s already a friction point. So we’re really excited with this, and our plans are to continue to help users see the value, and things like them going viral on TikTok has definitely been very helpful for us here,” she says. She also adds that these new users — the 13 percent integrating the feature — are seeking voice prompts out on their own because their creation isn’t part of the onboarding flow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DBrpFF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;46 percent of users have played a voice prompt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rMwHi3"&gt;People on the app record their voice in response to their selected but Hinge-curated prompts, so they aren’t just talking about nothing for 30 seconds. The most popular prompt so far, per a spokesperson, is: “A life goal of mine.” The second most popular is “All I ask is that you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiYZPu"&gt;Throughout our chat, Parsons emphasized the reason Hinge thought voice prompts made sense in a dating app. Namely, if people are “trying to assess vibe, personality, what [a match] is looking for, [and] what’s it like to date them,” Hinge is best off giving them as much data as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hN1FQ"&gt;“Our goals are to get users off of the app and into a relationship, or at the very least into a good date, and the constructed, the curated, doesn’t always necessarily relate to a positive experience with another person, and so we want to help users showcase more of their personality, more authenticity, which really comes from your voice — it’s really hard to hack your voice,” she says, adding that the team didn’t see “very high adoption” of voice calling, another audio-oriented feature, likely because making a cold call to a stranger is more intimidating than firing off a 30-second clip and hoping for the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6f5Z5N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People took to voice prompts, not voice calls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HOSNgZ"&gt;Now, part two of this story is how Hinge got lucky with this viral moment. Lots of other apps are trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22570683/audio-short-form-podcast-app-racket-beams"&gt;create the TikTok of audio&lt;/a&gt; — Facebook chief among them, along with many decently funded startups focusing on shortform audio. Hinge didn’t set out to make a viral feature that would come with wide-ranging network effects, or at least Parsons says that wasn’t the intent. So why did this take off? For a couple reasons, I think. For one: Hinge already has a massive network. It’s been downloaded &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Earnings-Letter-Q2-2020.pdf"&gt;more than 5 million times&lt;/a&gt; and has a better shot of making a feature popular over a startup. (Facebook has yet to widely launch its attempt at shortform audio, Soundbites, and I’ll be watching how that performs for similar reasons.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOeCwB"&gt;Two: The dating app space is particularly ripe for viral audio — context is everything. A random person telling you their opinion on what NYC pizza spot is the best or, god forbid, their life goal is incredibly boring. There are no stakes — why do I care? But if you’re instead assessing whether you want to literally meet this person or hook up with them, all of a sudden, that opinion is critical. (L&amp;amp;B’s, baby!) This is also probably why Clubhouse had such a pandemic moment. Currently, I can go talk to my friends and family IRL or over the phone or even go to a bar to chat up a stranger — why do I want to have someone talking at me through an app? But when we were all stuck at home, the stakes were real. When will I meet a new person again??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsuQij"&gt;All of which is to say, these startups have a challenge ahead of them. TikTok made remixing sound and visuals viral fodder, and the same will happen solely for audio, too, I’m sure. But will it be inside a wholly new app or one you join for some other purpose and audio is the fun bit on top? My bet is on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="EX2OXQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQz2bE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: The newest $100 million podcasting app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJJn2J"&gt;There’s a new, highly funded podcast app on the market: Podimo. The app, which has yet to come out in the US but launched in 2019 and is already in multiple European and Latin American countries, announced its $78 million Series B funding round late last week, bringing its total funding to over $100 million. That’s a number familiar to those of us who’ve been watching this space for a minute now — Luminary famously launched with $100 million in funding, as did Himalaya. (Though a source told me Himalaya’s funding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526502/himalaya-histudios-notorious-llc-podcast-audio-hype-house"&gt;was made up&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVpxX1"&gt;Funnily enough, Podimo’s strategy is somewhat similar to both those companies’ in that its business is built around subscription audio. Users pay a set amount per month to stream as many exclusive podcasts, audiobooks, and “experiences” as they want, and Podimo pays the creators of that audio based on their content’s popularity. (SoundCloud is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309090/soundcloud-artist-stream-pay-listener-fan-royalties"&gt;deploying a similar model&lt;/a&gt; for music.) So, if you listen to podcasts on Podimo and 20 percent of your time is spent listening to one specific show, 20 percent of your subscription payment will go to that audio creator, minus the cut Podimo takes for its services. (RSS-based podcasts can also distribute on Podimo, but they get less of a cut of that listener revenue.) The idea is that creators will be incentivized to promote Podimo because they make money off the listeners there, and they’ll also be encouraged to go exclusive to make even more, along with other perks, like extra promotion. Podimo says it has over 950 exclusive shows and audiobooks on the platform currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uw0WT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Podimo raised $78 million in its Series B round&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ioYqPj"&gt;I spoke with Podimo’s CEO and founder, Morten Strunge, before the holiday to get a better sense of how Podimo plans to use this recent cash infusion and how its past couple years have gone. The question I most wanted to know, of course, was when Podimo might launch stateside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DffDMC"&gt;“It’s not the top of our list,” he says. “It’s not that we don’t see an opportunity for a service like Podimo in the US, but obviously competition is bigger there, and it requires deeper pockets to make a difference. So it’s definitely on our roadmap, but it’s not the first country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD0dPb"&gt;The funding he says will broadly go toward “content” and “creators,” like “bringing even more content onto the platform that in return will fuel user growth.” The team will also invest in marketing, the actual tech product, and expanding to new markets. Notably, Podimo partners with hosts and fronts the creation costs for exclusive shows, so this funding will help the team do more of that. Strunge also adds that 90 percent of listening happens in a user’s native language, so Spanish, Danish, Norwegian, and German, and the team is hyper-focused on approaching each of its markets locally. It already partners with &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/press-release/podimo-wondery"&gt;Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.iheartmedia.com/press/iheartmedia-and-podimo-partner-translate-and-adapt-widely-popular-podcasts-listeners-globally"&gt;iHeartMedia&lt;/a&gt;, and Sony Music Entertainment’s &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/press-release/somethinelse-podimo-translation"&gt;Somethin’ Else&lt;/a&gt; to translate their English-language shows for Podimo’s users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frMDDM"&gt;In Denmark, Strunge says the company has 100,000 paying subscribers out of a market of 6 million people. “What’s been important for us is to show that this is not a niche thing, but it’s actually a mass market thing, something that millions of people would subscribe to in a market like Germany and not thousands of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbvG7c"&gt;It’s all very similar to the big subscription dreams of Luminary and Himalaya. Both were focused on the US, and neither panned out as expected. But maybe going abroad changes that outcome, especially with so many shows under its exclusive offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cMzmYQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="Ao2q6I"&gt;Phew, we’re past the two big pieces and can get you onto more news. I don’t want to spend too much time here, so I’m just going to drop a few things to think about, and we’ll get either more into later this week for you paying subscribers or onto new things. Who can say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJL3VN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: RadioPublic says it’s fixed its app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MTrvj"&gt;Last week, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22797808/podcast-app-acquire-radiopublic-acast-rss-feed-hot-pod"&gt;reported on issues&lt;/a&gt; podcasters were having with the RadioPublic app — their RSS feeds weren’t updating; they couldn’t get in touch with anyone from the company; and new shows couldn’t be added to the catalog. The company tells me it has now fixed the issue. Matt MacDonald, CPO at Acast and RadioPublic co-founder, says the issue had to do with an &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-10-04"&gt;expired SSL certificate&lt;/a&gt; from Let’s Encrypt. Here’s what MacDonald had to say about the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SyH9Ea"&gt;“We have systems in place to readily catch bugs, problems our podcasters encounter, and issues affecting feeds. This issue in particular was of a nature that evaded those systems. It’s one we regrettably missed and should have caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TFOaM"&gt; Since resolving the issue, we’ve updated RadioPublic’s systems to avoid future problems of this nature. Our team continues to monitor that all our services are running smoothly, and when our Pro users encounter issues and contact us, we continue to provide individualized support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S8c5GN"&gt;Let me know if you keep running into issues, but this should hopefully be solved for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LcNO6f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R2THE8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple divulges the most popular subscription shows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ52zm"&gt;Apple Podcasts is getting into the end-of-year content early with new charts and curated content. The company &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-podcasts-presents-the-best-of-2021/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its curated selection of the best shows and episodes of the year just around an hour ago — &lt;em&gt;A Slight Change of Plan&lt;/em&gt; from Pushkin is its top pick — as well as new charts around free and paid shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyAcIZ"&gt;I’m including screenshots of the full list below, but I want to specifically call attention to the top paid shows. Three Uncanny Four’s &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt; is the top paid show, which, as we last know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697263/john-carreyrou-theranos-elizabeth-holmes-decoder"&gt;from September&lt;/a&gt;, had 6,000 paying subscribers. We can probably presume that’s gone up a bit since the Theranos trial has picked up, but that’s essentially the ceiling. (What happens to this feed when the trial ends?) Otherwise, Betches has two shows in the top 10 individual subscription shows, and people are apparently paying for Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon’s program, too, which hm, who knows what’s going to happen after all this recent Cuomo controversy. Apple spokesperson Zach Kahn had nothing to share around when or if these charts might get updated again. I might have more on this on Thursday once I have time to parse, but if you have thoughts, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AoJngb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify and Netflix are friends who launch audio hubs together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uwZJW"&gt;I have seen &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of hype over Spotify and Netflix’s news &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-23/get-even-more-squid-game-bridgerton-and-money-heist-with-our-new-netflix-collaboration-and-dedicated-hub/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that they’re partnering to launch an audio hub on the Spotify app. This means Netflix’s publicly available podcasts (read: available everywhere) are now in one place on the Spotify app, along with music from popular programs. Currently, one soundtrack, &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;, is called an “enhanced album” with the Spotify logo on the cover, which means it includes a video intro from writer, director, and soundtrack EP Jeymes Samuel. Despite the hype, I’m unconvinced this is a monumental moment. If Netflix were ever to go the exclusive podcast route, I think they’d likely include them in its own app — why would it cede any of viewers’ attention to Spotify? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQoobP"&gt;Could this mean more collabs in the future between the two companies? Sure. Does this just logically make sense as a partnership? Yes. People want to listen to Netflix soundtracks, and Spotify is making it easier for them to do so along with some bonus content. Friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPuDu9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse monthly users reportedly fall off a cliff but are still millions-strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIB12z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-clubhouse-poster-child-pandemic-hype-2021-11"&gt;a big look at Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; this past week that hits the major points of conversation around the app: the dearth of advertisers, a drop-off in downloads, and controversial “drama rooms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qavq5S"&gt;The main data takeaway is a graph depicting that in July, Clubhouse reportedly peaked with 13.45 million monthly active users but just a couple weeks ago had fallen to only 6.78 million. Its daily active users dropped from 4.09 million at its peak in February to around 942,000 two weeks ago. All that data is according to a company called Apptopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GogiwH"&gt;A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; the app is a place where “millions gather daily” and that overall growth exceeded expectations. “We expect to see a regular fluctuation as we grow,” this spokesperson added, along with the fact that 700,000 rooms are created daily, and the average time spent on the app is 70 minutes. Millions of people logging on monthly doesn’t read so badly to me, but the drop is steep and something Clubhouse is going to need to turn around before its competitors seize the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Zi4jzn"&gt;
&lt;p id="EqksR4"&gt;All right! That’s it for today. I’ll catch you paying folks Thursday, and for those of you who have yet to subscribe, I don’t have a Black Friday special for you, except that &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;for $7 / month&lt;/a&gt;, you can impress all your friends and family with far too much audio industry knowledge. A deal IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA delays spacewalk due to threat of space debris</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6cR5UmdSvHPZM19jQr0-L7G_LnE=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209125/51712323194_e68ff4a0da_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Space Station&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPr6n7"&gt;Early this morning, NASA postponed a spacewalk scheduled to occur outside the International Space Station today, after getting word of a possible safety threat from some nearby space debris. It’s unclear where the debris is coming from, but the delay comes about two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia blew up one of its own satellites in orbit&lt;/a&gt;, creating thousands of dangerous fragments that threatened the space station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMEpbu"&gt;NASA astronauts Kayla Barron and Thomas Marshburn were all set to don spacesuits and leave the confines of the ISS this morning at around 7:10AM ET, in order to replace an antenna on the outside of the station. It would have been the fifth spacewalk for Marshburn and the first for Barron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wmdlVg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA says that it didn’t have enough time to “properly assess the risk”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIV6yH"&gt;But before they could depart through the airlock, NASA personnel in mission control stopped the spacewalk. “It’s just real life, this is how things work out sometimes, and I’m really glad you fellows are looking out for our safety,” Mark Vande Hei, one of the astronauts on board the ISS, told flight controllers in mission control, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-spacewalk-called-off-possible-risk-space-debris-notification/"&gt;according to CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHthsN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/f32d86b1-dc7c-4815-9893-9b4d69bdef27"&gt;In a short blog post&lt;/a&gt;, NASA says that it didn’t have enough time to “properly assess the risk” the debris posed to the astronauts, and so the agency opted to postpone the spacewalk until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JxBUnv"&gt;It’s the second time in the last two weeks that space debris has upended plans on the International Space Station. On November 15th, the astronauts onboard the ISS were awakened extra early by mission controllers and told to shelter in place after Russia conducted an anti-satellite, or ASAT, test. Using some kind of kinetic missile, Russia blew up one of its own satellites, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791176/russia-asat-satellite-test-space-debris-visualizations"&gt;creating at least 1,700 pieces of trackable debris&lt;/a&gt; and thousands of smaller pieces that cannot be tracked. As the satellite was orbiting relatively close to the ISS, the debris cloud periodically passed near the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5EBTS"&gt;NASA did not say if the debris that postponed the spacewalk is from the same ASAT test, and the space agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, NASA insinuated the delay will not have a big impact on the station. “The space station schedule and operations are able to easily accommodate the delay of the spacewalk,” NASA wrote in its blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqd9Sx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyNDe3"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj5fFb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9q3Di"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nIdln"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rodOqm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NBA is partnering with Infinite Objects to put your Top Shot NFTs on display IRL</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjUEaMWYw4LAeHTIBtJf5JjhV_k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70208763/NBATopshot_IOxTS_Durant_James_still.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NCmk7a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot moments&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most high-profile NFT successes so far, part of the initial early hype wave for the blockchain-based art that’s become one of the biggest buzzwords of 2021. And thanks to a new partnership with Infinite Objects, Top Shot owners will soon be able to immortalize their favorite clips in the real world with officially licensed looping video frames from Infinite Objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aF12sU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The NBA tries to make a slam dunk out of NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u7xp35"&gt;Starting today, Top Shot owners will be able to log into Infinite Object’s portal, connect their Dapper account, view all their currently owned moments, and order a “Video Print” of the clip. Only the owner of an NBA Top Shot moment will be able to buy an Infinite Object frame with the associated video clip on it, and each frame will come with a QR code and holographic sticker to attest to its authenticity. Right now, all Top Shot moments are eligible to be printed except for those featuring retired players or those with WNBA clips (Infinite Objects says its still working out the licensing there.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i_0lAh4OFBF20usf93YCdslhkpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050744/1_xi2VP4sDHqmXTlJ3lUUJKA.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="icrznq"&gt;The Infinite Object NBA Top Shot frames will cost $199 for the 5.7 x 8.4 inch “Large” size  and $399 for the bigger 11.4 x 7.5 inch “Extra Large” size. Each frame can only display a single moment, which can’t be changed out or swapped after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtZXJ9"&gt;The official frames — at least in theory — answer a major question about Top Shot moments (and NFTs in general): what to actually do with the digital artwork once you’ve bought it. And Infinite Objects is also working to enable “printing” other NFTs from artists outside of the NBA in the future, too. That said, there’s nothing about the Infinite Objects prints that would prevent you from ordering a video print and then selling the NFT while still having the art on display in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qDKnWq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZ5CSejZe3v7ouDitLAO9XpUCRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050740/Shopify_Topshot_Preview_V3.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IL6El"&gt;Infinite Objects is a natural fit in a lot of ways for bringing NFTs into the real world — the company’s “Video Print” frames launched back in 2019 as a way to bring collectible digital GIFs and videos off the internet, long before the current NFT hype had begun. The original idea of the company even sounds a lot like NFTs (albeit without the blockchain component), where Infinite Objects sold limited-run looping video frames for prices as high as $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPtzYT"&gt;Since then, the company has also expanded to partner with Giphy on selling animated emojis and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21097049/giphy-infinite-objects-valentines-day-gifs"&gt;Valentine’s Day cards&lt;/a&gt;, along with previous (not-NFT-related) &lt;a href="https://infiniteobjects.com/collections/nba"&gt;NBA partnerships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMiLQl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Sxmnx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
