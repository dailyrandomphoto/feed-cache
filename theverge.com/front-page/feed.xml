    <title>Prosecutors say Google accessed private WhatsApp messages — but the evidence is thin</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1i4pN8"&gt;On Wednesday, the Texas attorney general announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;a far-reaching antitrust case&lt;/a&gt; against Google’s ad business. &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20428869-the_state_of_texas_et_al_v_google__txedce-20-00957__00010"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt; makes a lot of eye-opening allegations, including a long-running conspiracy between Google and Facebook to defuse the threat of header bidding, but one of the strangest allegations had to do with WhatsApp. According to the complaint, Google made a deal with Facebook to access millions of private messages, and photos from WhatsApp users, shortly after the app was acquired.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwTZUS"&gt;The specific allegation comes 57 pages into the complaint. The passage is heavily redacted, but it unmistakably alleges an exclusive agreement between Google and Facebook, granting Google access to users’ WhatsApp messages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZozDixph--tAUeyMHZ-qCEuqag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177260/Screen_Shot_2020_12_17_at_8.55.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An excerpt from p57 of the Texas v. Google complaint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q4rAe3"&gt;This is an extraordinary claim for a couple of reasons. WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, which means Facebook did not have centralized access to user messages at the time of the acquisition. (This is in contrast to a service like Gmail, where Google retains all of the messages on its servers and can scan them en masse.) That should make it impossible for Facebook to cut this kind of access deal to another company since it doesn’t have access itself. The whole point of end-to-end encryption is that it’s impossible for a company to trade away user privacy in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKkA4A"&gt;So... what is Texas talking about here? The clearest explanation — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1339326648160669696"&gt;put forward by Stanford’s Alex Stamos&lt;/a&gt;, among others — is that the passage is actually referring to backup files, which are initiated by the user and lie outside the service’s end-to-end encryption. But even then, the claims don’t quite hold water. Google does make it easy for Android users to store WhatsApp backups on Google Drive — but there’s nothing exclusive about the deal, and it’s not clear why it would have required a written contract. iOS users can store backups on iCloud too, and in each case, the backup is only created if the user initiates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0wkHA"&gt;Neither Google nor Facebook would provide an on-the-record statement, citing the sensitivity of the ongoing legal proceeding, but on background, both denied any exclusive deal to share WhatsApp user data. Google also pointed to a previous statement from Sundar Pichai, where the CEO committed to not using Drive data for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QirWWv"&gt;“We don’t sell your information to anyone,” Pichai &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/keeping-private-information-private/"&gt;wrote in June&lt;/a&gt;, “and we don’t use information in apps where you primarily store personal content—such as Gmail, Drive, Calendar and Photos—for advertising purposes, period.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvihPi"&gt;That leaves us in a difficult place. This complaint was the result of months of probes to both Google and Facebook, which almost certainly turned up information that hasn’t been made public. But the redactions and general confusion around the case make it difficult to tell how much is actually there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEVA1f"&gt;The idea of a backroom deal to unlock millions of private messages is too alarming to ignore, but it’s also too alarming to accept at face value — especially when it contradicts so much of what we know about how these systems work. Along with the other claims of Facebook collusion, this will place a massive burden of proof on prosecutors as the case goes forward. But for now at least, it seems as if Texas has dropped a bombshell claim without backing it up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-822" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6-IseMU-VKzo5xzTTBT8BVk65z1R7t_lZHR-ApDuYug7wocNVuNr-RoCuiUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D433%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9008008%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D111830562%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA61H2BRTbBBeDsoekxoiD1iyavhCvjOe-rc1VRE8KROBAR83M_YmAIBoC31kQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $125 or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724675251539044953" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000014846099%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Brand%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9008008%26targetid%3Dpla-82462042369%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAoOz-BRBdEiwAyuvA6z1zgThWDp2tf3j60kOubPIybm5uNl4EBzedCsO2Rm4cjFVJV1QJbxoCUaAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-348" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at Woot, which has Apple’s flagship earbuds for $190. If that deal sells out, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$199 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-airpods-pro-mwp22am-a-in-the-ear-bluetooth-headset-white%2Fproduct_24422954&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Spin is adding sensor-powered ADAS to its electric scooters to curb scofflaw riding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJJNmeGtN8PP5z9UfTtKrgePHLs=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68532706/A51A1055__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XGEvRH"&gt;Spin, the electric scooter company owned by Ford, says it has a novel solution to the problem of sidewalk clutter and scofflaw riders. The company is teaming up with an IoT startup called Drover AI to add cameras, sensor arrays, and onboard computers to all of their scooters in the hopes of curbing improper parking and riding behavior by customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQBe3n"&gt;Spin has forged an “exclusive partnership” with the Los Angeles-based Drover AI to use the startup’s PathPilot technology in Spin’s next-generation Insight monitoring platform in US cities. By equipping its scooters with cameras and sensors, Spin hopes to better “understand its surroundings in real time and assist riders in making safe riding decisions.” Also, Spin will share data generated by the new equipment with cities to help them better regulate shared fleets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="atOALY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Understand its surroundings in real time and assist riders in making safe riding decisions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8MWKdF"&gt;Ideally, Spin will be able to track where its scooters are being ridden, and then share that data with cities so planners can make decisions about traffic congestion and bike lane placement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZo9moRTe6QgB9r3COZ10AaGhRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22178632/Artboard_5.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc0GkZ"&gt;Since they launched several years ago, the shared scooter industry has been plagued by the twin scourges of sidewalk clutter and dangerous riding behavior by some customers. This has led cities to demand more innovative solutions from companies for controlling how their vehicles are used in public spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aasjXj"&gt;Drover AI’s new equipment is attached right below the handlebars, with a second module fixed lower on the stem. Spin describes the “array of sensors” as “visual, inertial, environmental, and positioning sensors,” which will be used for “granular location awareness.” Think of it as an advanced driver assistance system, like Tesla’s Autopilot, Spin says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rAQzF0"&gt;Akin to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that use on-board sensors to help automobile drivers park, brake, and stay in their lanes, Spin Insight Level 2 has the ability to combine the latest in sensor and artificial intelligence technologies to enable local regulation compliance enforcement and create a safer experience for riders and pedestrians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wSDkLE"&gt;The company is hoping that the new technology will give it an edge in New York City, which is now accepting applications for a limited number of permits for its first shared scooter pilot. The competition for the new permits is expected to be fierce, with practically every major scooter company hoping to prove its commitment to safety and law-abidingness to the city’s Department of Transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fn0cc9"&gt;New York City is expected to announce the winners in spring 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yrravQwglpzWOC1tZVT479bwzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose Sleepbuds II review: get your eight hours</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;These earbuds are only made for sleeping&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="F2fq6a"&gt;Like I imagine many of us do these days, I often have trouble sleeping. To add to that, I have always been a light sleeper and can be easily awakened by a variety of noises: an especially loud siren outside, a crack of thunder, the heat suddenly coming on in the early morning hours. So I was the perfect person to try out the Bose Sleepbuds II, a set of $250 earbuds, which are specifically designed not to play music or podcasts, but to block out and replace sounds that might disturb your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u57mCq"&gt;The Bose Sleepbuds II are a pair of small — very small — earbuds that were built specifically to try to help you sleep using a combination of sounds and music. They are a follow-up to the rather disastrous introduction of the first-gen pair, which suffered from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20899371/bose-sleepbuds-faulty-battery-issues-problem-refunds-price"&gt;inconsistent battery life and sudden shutdowns&lt;/a&gt;. This second generation has gone through several improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleepbuds are small enough to fit snugly into your ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjNQfrOBCv32C7irpg2-e230IYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175615/akrales_201215_4331_0033.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleepbuds II are small enough to fit snugly into your ear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N27JR5"&gt;To begin, they are using a completely different battery technology. The previous generation were built around silver zinc batteries that, according to a Bose representative, “are very high in energy density, which makes them very good for an application like ours.” In other words, they could pack a lot of battery life into a very small package. But they turned out not to be ideal for consumer products — thus, the sudden shutdowns. As a result, the Sleepbuds II are based around more familiar nickel-metal hydride batteries, which means they have approximately 10 hours of life rather than the previous 16 but should prove to be more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBYZa1"&gt;Other changes include better low-end response to improve noise blocking, better connectivity, and an anti-friction coating to prevent extraneous sounds (like rubbing against a pillow) to interfere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="95ZApX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10231545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cWsHI"&gt;So now that we know what’s changed, how do they work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6BevW"&gt;The Sleepbuds II attach to your phone via a low-energy Bluetooth connection, which is used to transfer the various sounds to the buds. (Note that I use the term “transfer” and not “stream” since the sounds actually live on the buds rather than your phone.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPtg15"&gt;There are three classifications of sounds that you can listen to. Noise Masking sounds are supposed to cover up any noises (such as snoring) that can disturb your sleep. Naturescapes are meant to soothe you with natural sounds such as rain or leaves rustling. Finally, Tranquilities are quiet musical selections described as “relaxing tones.’’ A few of these are already loaded onto the buds when you get them; after that, you use Bose’s Sleep app to check out others you may want to use instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3CrqU"&gt;To tell you the truth, I couldn’t find much difference between many of the Noise Masking and Naturescapes sounds, especially since the former uses several nature sounds, such as a campfire or a breeze blowing. That didn’t bother me; both sets of sounds were pleasant enough. I was, however, disappointed with Tranquilities, which were, as far as I could tell, made up mostly of new-age genre music, useless to someone who finds that kind of monotonous tonality irritating. A quiet classical number would have worked a lot better for me — but of course, it’s a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rViBpP"&gt;The buds themselves come in a round, hockey puck-sized case with a top that slides open. They fit nicely into two small slots within the case, labeled for the left and right ears. The buds themselves are labeled for “L” and “R,” but the labels are covered by the tips, and so they aren’t much use. Still, it is easy enough to figure out which bud fits into which ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55P50L"&gt;A series of small LEDs at the edge of the case let you know how much power is left in the case itself. It will hold two or three power-ups before it needs to be plugged in via a USB-C connection. (The only way to know if the buds are low in power is to check the app.) There is also an LED in front of each earbud that pulses while each one is powering up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LEDs let you know how much power is left in the case." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVt5DiTgAjZ3SLmfB7Bw2FChrO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175618/akrales_201215_4331_0088.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEDs let you know how much power is left in the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jjBNZl"&gt;The Sleepbuds come with three differently sized tips. I tried the medium, which were on the buds when I first got them, but they were uncomfortable, verging on painful, so I switched to the small, which fit fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzTmUc"&gt;You use the associated Bose Sleep app to choose which sounds you want to listen to at night. The buds must be out of the case for them to attach to the app, and connecting takes around 15–20 seconds, but they always eventually attached. Because the sounds are directly downloaded into the buds, you can only have a limited number in your library at one time — usually about 10, although that can vary depending on which sounds you’re using. If you hit your maximum, you are warned that you have to remove a sound before you can upload another. The upload will take about 10 to 20 minutes — because the buds use low-energy Bluetooth, their upload speed isn’t going to be as fast as, say, your typical phone app — so it’s best to do your sound experimentation before bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleep app lets you choose a sound for the night; you can also set an alarm." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sj9cda8TQo2Xem1i6MXGkOLb0MQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175842/Screenshot_20201216_151723.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleep app lets you control the buds; you can also set an alarm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Sleep app lets you choose a sound for the night; you can also set an alarm." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qC4amQUhhs-1Hs6V1rW6Kr_YHW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175841/Screenshot_20201216_152009.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound Library lets you download a variety of sounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2YAyZU"&gt;Besides the sounds themselves, you can also set an alarm and be alerted to phone calls. Both are useful. But while you can be alerted that a call is coming in, you can’t answer the phone using the buds. So while you may not wake your partner with an early phone call, you certainly might when rushing out of the room to answer it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJUW0I"&gt;If you don’t want to keep your earbuds attached to your phone all night, and you’ve already downloaded the sound you want to use, you can use the “phone free” mode. However, because you aren’t connected to the phone, you can’t use the alarm or be alerted to phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="alelFw"&gt;But do they work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UcZqqN"&gt;So, the main question: are they effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqRnvb"&gt;To tell you the truth, as someone who is not used to falling asleep to anything but relative quiet (I live in NYC, so it’s got to be “relative”), the idea of purposefully listening to sounds or music seemed a little off to me. But I have to say, after trying it out, it is not a bad idea at all. I like listening to rain, and there were several noise-masking “rainy” sounds that worked quite well. The buds didn’t mask &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, but they took care of random street noises and the baby next door quite well. And other noises were, if not completely masked, deadened to the point where they weren’t much of a disturbance. (I can also see where the Sleepbuds would be ideal for napping on a plane or train.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tVjAbh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The buds didn’t mask &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, but they took care of random street noises and the baby next door quite well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qLQTx5"&gt;The buds were also perfectly comfortable to wear. During the test period, I wore them for about six to seven hours a night, with the sound constantly on (you can also set them to shut off after a certain number of minutes or hours) and found that they went from 100 percent to 40–45 percent power during that time. So using them at night, and then charging them during the day, works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKQGKB"&gt;Judging from my experience and what I’ve read about the first set of Sleepbuds, these are definitely an improvement over their predecessors. (There was at least one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bose/comments/ji1z8z/sleepbuds_ii_burning/"&gt;report of the new model burning and discoloring&lt;/a&gt;, but the defective unit was apparently exchanged and no further problems were reported.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t97hDI"&gt;There’s only one more question to ask: are they worth the price? That depends. If you have real problems sleeping because of environmental noise or even tension, it might be worth it to pay $250 for a pair of earbuds whose only purpose is to help you sleep. (Of course, if your sleeplessness is due to medical issues such as sleep apnea, a doctor’s visit is probably in order.) The effectiveness of Bose’s Sleepbuds II is probably very personal. They may work well for some people and less so for others. In my case, they did improve my sleep somewhat, for which I was grateful — but whether they’d be worth the investment is something I’d have to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="XbXZIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10229415"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D5c3ng-nWdTqNlaVSdKfNNMK_i4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528952/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dy6khW"&gt;I always enjoy this time of the year. Usually, I take some time off of work and use it as a golden opportunity to tackle my ever-growing backlog of games. With the year wrapping up and a ton of great games already available (and even more coming over the next few years), it’s truly a great time to be a gamer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYuaN0"&gt;Today’s deals spotlight an incredible deal for PS4 and PS5 owners, a sale on Dell’s 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor, plus a few deals on some great headphones and wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdAxM"&gt;Get two years of PlayStation Plus for less than $60&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1npEWm"&gt;If you were one of the lucky ones to grab a PS5, I recommend taking advantage of this PlayStation Plus subscription deal at Eneba.com. Normally $60 through Sony, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.eneba.com/us/psn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__e_21327737__r_google.com__t_w__d_D#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $32&lt;/a&gt;. However, if you want the most bang for your buck, I strongly advise picking up two one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions. You can get it for $58 by using code &lt;strong&gt;DECEMBERPLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mJZw"&gt;This is a great price if you want online multiplayer, free monthly games, and access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital compilation of “generation-defining” PS4 games available exclusively for PS5 users with an active PlayStation Plus membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1PkT7"&gt;And yes, this membership will still work on PS4 consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="57p3e9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vUaxRi"&gt;Grab a 27-inch Dell 1440p gaming monitor for $450&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TfrSK0"&gt;If you recently upgraded your PC gaming rig to deliver a 1440p resolution gaming experience and need a monitor to support the higher resolution, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-27-gaming-monitor-s2721dgf%2Fapd%2F210-axeh%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories%3FAID%3D4485850%26cjevent%3D1604740b406c11eb83c600aa0a240614%26gacd%3D9694607-23736398-5750457-266319267-127795103%26dgc%3Daf%26VEN1%3D12578053-4485850-162f05da406c11eba4e79633568f93140INT%26dclid%3DCOHZjoKQ1e0CFcnmKAUdgZcBwA#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s S2721DGF gaming monitor is down to $450&lt;/a&gt; (usually $610) on the company’s direct website. This monitor supports Nvidia G-Sync, includes a 16:9 aspect ratio IPS panel, and supports HDR400 with a 98 percent DCI-P3 color gamut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Tiuch"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232615"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="71kLdg"&gt;Save $100 on Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rPuSg7"&gt;If you want a comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones and are okay with spending a pretty penny for better sound quality, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser’s third-generation Momentum Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; are excellent. Over at Amazon, you can get these wireless headphones for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B07VW98ZKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b205e0761da348f87244cc7c77f67222&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 in black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-Cancelling-Headphones-Functionality/dp/B08B3MJBW8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=84f04a510180642cbea1d89730b0446b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kBHDvs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9636852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oahnAZ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are under $200 (again) at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXlgAF"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/25/21719200/apple-airpods-pros-black-friday-deal-sale-walmart"&gt;not the lowest price&lt;/a&gt; we have seen Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds go, but getting these for under $200 is still a great bargain. The AirPods Pro are on sale at a few places, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-19" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the lowest right now is $190 at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an active Amazon Prime membership, you can get free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FeOG6B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best TV shows of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wjN6FQkeTT4AJBcz36Ie5HKsKNo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528994/JAN22_D035_EP08_078_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mF7Lbs"&gt;TV was a constant companion in 2020. With most cultural institutions shut down, the small screen still managed to provide us with a deluge of new things to enjoy and talk about — far more than any one person could ever watch. In fact, at times this year, I found it difficult to watch anything — or at least, anything new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2npvQ"&gt;My habits were often fickle, and I danced across shows new and old; I started many and finished few on my journey to get lost in &lt;em&gt;something.&lt;/em&gt; And so even in this extraordinary year, the usual caveats apply. I am but one person, and I cannot watch &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; television. Here, in no particular order, are the shows that stayed with me, long after I turned off the set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLpaHC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sfrxqA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dare Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HmU2un"&gt;While the show premiered in 2019, the rest of &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 episodes aired in 2020, and each of them was among the best dramas of the year. Based on Megan Abbott’s novel of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt; followed the friendship between high school cheerleaders Beth and Addy — and what happened when their ambitious new coach Colette French got a little too involved in their lives. A high school noir thriller with tremendous pacing and performances, &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt; was brave, bold television that, while canceled, works incredibly well as a standalone season of TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqMcKL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Tf3VCz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To With John Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3jXpER"&gt;The strangest show of 2020, &lt;em&gt;How To&lt;/em&gt; is part documentary, part video essay, and part cringe comedy. Each of &lt;em&gt;How To With John Wilson&lt;/em&gt;’s six episodes starts with a simple question — how to split a check, for example — and then proceeds to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; answer it in the most incredible ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXoJ4s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To &lt;/em&gt;is also an instruction manual for loving the city you live in: it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;embraces the inherent strangeness of being in close proximity to so many others and responds to this weirdness with affection. No other show I’ve ever seen is so concerned with the meaning of scaffolding, or with a man who’s obsessed with the health benefits of foreskin. Watching &lt;em&gt;How To With John Wilson&lt;/em&gt; will make you care more about the weirdos in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRmb7G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TzyCm4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good Lord Bird&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NdQfwX"&gt;Americans’ collective understanding of history is uncomplicated and dishonest and needs upending. Fortunately, in the meantime, there’s &lt;em&gt;The Good Lord Bird&lt;/em&gt;, a show based on the James McBride novel of the same name. The show presents itself as a mostly-true account of abolitionist John Brown’s final days, as seen through the eyes of a young man he “rescues” and continually mistakes for a girl. It’s a funny and blunt look at the messy work of revolution, a story interested in tearing down the myth that progress is seen as a clean and noble pursuit in its time.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VAOPI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cgDVuj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BIXtU4"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights &lt;/em&gt;were a comedy, it’d probably look a lot like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;. The sleeper-hit series fleshes out the eponymous character — who’s mostly known from commercials — and builds a fish-out-of-water comedy around him. The premise: Ted Lasso, a folksy American football coach, is inexplicably hired to lead a troubled soccer team in England. It’s a ridiculous idea and everyone knows it — but what no one knows is that Lasso is being set up to take the fall by a cynical team owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXxrZA"&gt;In this tension, &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;sings: it’s a show about what it means to relentlessly work to be a good, positive person in a hostile environment. It’s about picking yourself up over and over again in the hopes that your faith in others becomes contagious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik7yc2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ArnrGB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mythic Quest: Raven’s Banquet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tDkdSZ"&gt;The first good show about video games is here, and, surprisingly, it’s also terrific fun for people who don’t know the first thing about them. A scathing workplace comedy about the pleasures (few) and toxicity (plentiful) of game development from the creators of &lt;em&gt;It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; follows the employees at a studio behind a popular online game. The show succeeds because it refuses to pull punches: &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; makes no bones about the fact that it’s a show about a sexist industry that seeks to pacify online trolls and Nazis, and with that clarity comes some pretty damn good comedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgaCs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3rh8nG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Boys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6N7Nsr"&gt;Superheroes are blunt instruments, primary-color metaphors for very simple ideas. This isn’t a drag. I think it’s what makes them good, a vehicle for stories that translate across decades and media. &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; is a show about the people wielding those instruments, now that they’ve become extremely valuable corporate IP, controlled by a handful of people. Juvenile, on-the-nose, and incredibly bingeable, &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; grew in its second season and turned its eye toward fandom, and what happens when you cheer for a country like you do a rock star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="op7Dp8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9RbVAI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BzetYq"&gt;Arabella is on a deadline. She’s a viral success story, a blogger with a successful debut book working on her follow-up — mostly futilely. Because in the meantime Arabella is also struggling to rebuild her life after being drugged and raped on a night out. &lt;em&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/em&gt; shows Arabella taking on these twin endeavors; the result is a searing work of introspective television about what happens to a person who works in a world interested in the exploitation of trauma, and how the stories we tell ourselves to survive can also break us down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVur13"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/em&gt; is a messy, complicated story about equally messy and complicated people. It’s one of the best things you can watch this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBc3hM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ScNPMW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="z58FJk"&gt;Few shows are concerned with portraying complicated struggles of religious faith; even fewer are interested in exploring these stories in non-Christian contexts. &lt;em&gt;Ramy&lt;/em&gt; is different. In its second season, the Hulu comedy from comedian Ramy Youssef becomes a show about a young man who is bad at being Muslim but desperately wants to be good at it. Ramy pledges himself to a new sheikh, only to learn the depths of his all-consuming selfishness. It slowly alienates him from everyone he cares about, despite their faith in him. In &lt;em&gt;Ramy&lt;/em&gt;, faith makes you consider your own failings, and asks: what next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eouneA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8gwGx4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dGLMUe"&gt;Anyone who’s watched &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; knows that, five seasons in, Saul Goodman is going to do something irredeemably awful. &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt;’s 2020 episodes brought us closer to heartbreak as well-meaning huckster Jimmy McGill fully embraces his Saul Goodman alter ego and plays dangerous games with Kim Wexler, one of the only people who still cares about him. Catch up now — because while it’s far less popular than its predecessor &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/em&gt; has become a much better show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzdfIE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GjWQsD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HC7crW"&gt;The second season of &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol &lt;/em&gt;ditches the more annoying aspects of its first season — namely, an annoying, omniscient villain who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; narrated — and doubles down on what worked: stories about broken people Going Through It. In &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt;, accepting who you are is dangerous, frightening work, especially when you might be a powerful cyborg, host to a deadly cosmic being, or a system of alternate personalities that each possess a devastating power. Irreverent, weird, and affectionate, &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol &lt;/em&gt;is the best new DC Comics adaptation you can watch right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpMBPO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zBrXjA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yDJthD"&gt;Was Michael Jordan the GOAT? We could argue all day. Was he really that &lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt;? Without question. &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance &lt;/em&gt;is less about Michael Jordan the man than it is about Michael Jordan the phenomenon. Framed against in-depth, never-before-seen footage that followed Jordan’s final year with the Chicago Bulls, the superstar’s career is recounted across 10 episodes that feature interviews with former teammates, rivals, and His Airness himself. Filmed with Jordan’s involvement, it’s less an argument about the man and more a document of how he sees his time as the biggest name in basketball — which, like the best documentary subjects, is a bit more revealing than he might think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="XEr89z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What We Do In The Shadows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WuOUTR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What We Do In the Shadows&lt;/em&gt; became great in its second season by leaning into the things that made it different from the film it was based on. Namely, Colin Robinson, an “energy vampire” who looks like a normal dude — only he feeds off the misery victims get from the &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; dull conversations he holds. And then, Guillermo de la Cruz, a familiar who desperately wants to be a vampire but has &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; learned he is destined to be a vampire hunter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khYd2h"&gt;These two are &lt;em&gt;What We Do In The Shadows’&lt;/em&gt; secret weapons, comedic haymakers deployed when the already-good premise of a mockumentary about vampires living together in Staten Island needs a little bit of shaking up. Which, honestly, doesn’t really need to happen. That &lt;em&gt;What We Do in the Shadows &lt;/em&gt;does it anyway is why it’s one of the best comedies on TV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook rolls back ‘nicer’ News Feed that boosted mainstream publishers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x25Yo"&gt;Facebook has reversed a change to its News Feed algorithm that prioritized authoritative news sources, even though some employees asked that the “nicer” News Feed become permanent, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;according to The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UtVBy"&gt;Following a sharp increase in misinformation on the platform in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612728/facebook-news-feed-us-election-change-mainstream-news-misinformation"&gt;Facebook changed how it weighed&lt;/a&gt; the quality of news sources based on a “news ecosystem quality” (NEQ) score. Outlets including the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, NPR, and CNN saw Facebook traffic rise, while more partisan sites that published incendiary or misleading news about the election saw Facebook traffic decrease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJptF1"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg had authorized the change to the News Feed in the days after the election when it became clear that unverified stories about election fraud and incorrect results were running rampant on Facebook. At a recent company meeting, some Facebook workers asked if the “nicer News Feed” could become permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5JB6v"&gt;But the change was always meant to be temporary. “This was a temporary change we made to help limit the spread of inaccurate claims about the election,” Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “News stories make up a small portion of what people see on Facebook overall, and political news makes up a smaller fraction of that news content. We’re still ensuring that people see authoritative and informative news on Facebook, especially during major news cycles and around important global topics like elections, COVID-19, and climate change.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu60dk"&gt;Facebook took other steps to try to limit election misinformation, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21548736/twitter-facebook-throttle-trump-tweet-election-theft"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. The platform announced in October it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506798/facebook-ban-political-ads-after-us-presidential-election-trump-biden-results-notification"&gt;ban US political ads&lt;/a&gt; after the election, and it planned to label posts about the election and redirect users to authoritative information. It also restricted paid promotions of election-related posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKhZ8"&gt;The company says since the election, it’s seen a decline in the amount of political content on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa8oBp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Checking in on everyone who went remote this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="YtzU3H"&gt;2020 has been a &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;, not least because much of the world pivoted to remote work. Industries that typically rely on in-person connections, like fitness and religious institutions, found themselves having to engage their audiences through live streams. Ad revenue disappeared from influencers and YouTubers, who are used to working remotely so long as they make money. Fashion influencers whose livelihoods depend on peddling an image of beauty and aspirational clothing were without events to attend or reasons to get dressed. Everyone needed to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brc2fz"&gt;In this piece, we look back on a few people we previously interviewed this year to hear how their remote transition has gone — do they anticipate staying remote? What have they learned from this challenging year? And will we collectively agree to forget 2020 ever happened and try to resume normalcy in 2021?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhB6In"&gt;Check out what they said below, and click through on the posts to read the original pieces mentioning them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fR2b50"&gt;In March, Mancao began pivoting her therapy Instagram account to address COVID-related stress and anxiety. She had just posted her first couple test posts covering the pandemic, including one called “COVID-19 Compassionate Reminders,” which suggested checking in on friends and family who are immunocompromised and donating to small businesses that might be struggling. She saw her Instagram as a way to reach people who might be interested in therapy but might not be able to financially afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1j4uM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she’s doing now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wopFkg"&gt;Nine months later, Mancao says she’s actually moved her content away from pandemic-related topics because ample information is already available, and “COVID content overload can really exhaust and burn people out.” She’ll post about the pandemic if necessary, though, like when she recently posted about setting boundaries with friends and family who might want to hang in-person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wrdu4U"&gt;Although Macao’s business has managed to stay afloat with new clients, she says other therapists she knows have struggled. Clients lost their insurance and income and can no longer afford services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffXazA"&gt;Many of her clients talk about burnout and the struggle with working, living, and having time off all in the same place: their home. She herself has focused on practicing what she advises, like not working from her bed and finding a routine that works for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gANF9i"&gt;“This year really taught us to find that balance between staying connected and having boundaries,” she says. Instagram is still a powerful, and free, place for her to spread information, but she’s found that throughout 2020, a post caption doesn’t capture the nuance of every situation and circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

Dana encourages us to think of and pray for the people in our lives as we string lights and hang ornaments in the coming days.

Thank you for joining us for this service of Morning Prayer and Reflection. Your support is appreciated!

*Please note that these services are filmed in advance.*&lt;/p&gt;Posted by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/12141462551"&gt;Washington National Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, December 8, 2020&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1qz7q3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Eckstrom, spokesman for the Washington National Cathedral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AQbEIK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21209540/passover-easter-seder-zoom-holiday-celebration-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the cathedral was doing in April, right before Easter Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dpVQU4"&gt;Eckstrom and the team at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC, were preparing for virtual Easter services when we last chatted. The team had already been streaming live services on Sundays, but Easter was a major test of their remote work. It’s an essential day for the cathedral, which is typically packed with 3,000 people in the building. The remote operation involved only 10 people in the building at once with the clergy tailoring the service to the pandemic. They took “spiritual” communions in which they consecrated the bread and wine without actually consuming it. They said a special prayer, too, which expressed that they wanted to take communion but couldn’t at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="V8lc8C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the church has been doing since&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PbNTas"&gt;The team is now preparing for Christmas services, and in the months since the pandemic started, the cathedral’s services have reached 1.8 million people and average between 6,000 and 7,500 people streaming Sunday morning services. The cathedral team has focused its live stream efforts on how best to make services resonate remotely, rather than making them an “afterthought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1eNei"&gt;“We will be doing essentially two separate versions of the same thing for the foreseeable future, and that’s a kind of a radical shift for us to put as much energy and attention into an online experience as we are into the in-person experience,” Eckstrom says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSTGR"&gt;Although some global viewers might eventually return to their home church when cities, states, and countries eventually open up, Eckstrom says some attendees say the virtual ceremonies have become a routine they want to continue. The cathedral considers the online world a second location at this point and will continue to stream after the pandemic wanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83KsCo"&gt;At the same time, however, monetizing the streams hasn’t been easy, especially with no in-person visits. The cathedral anticipates a loss of $5 million this year, mainly because of the lack of tourists buying things in the gift shop and café, and from the loss in event rentals. The team now solicits online donations, and although people have given money, it hasn’t made up for the lack of in-person visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFUp1n"&gt;“People want to make a visceral physical connection,” he says. “And that’s really hard to replicate online. We can use some of [the in-person cathedral experience], but not all of it, so we’re really anxious to be able to reopen the door, so that people can have that experience that we’ve been working on developing for about 113 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="KATqQY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bee Roper and Theo Gove-Humphries, vanlife YouTubers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SBr7tJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21228400/vanlife-influencers-instagram-youtube-coronavirus-pandemic-impact-space-food-income"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where in the world they were at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PBYuCz"&gt;Theo Gove-Humphries and Bee Roper had planned, before the pandemic, to fly themselves and their van from the UK to Canada and make their way throughout North America. But as soon as their visas were approved, Canada banned most inbound flights. The UK then shut its borders, too. The couple decided to move into the home of a friend, who themselves was stuck abroad, and focused on writing an ebook about their Scandinavian travels. YouTube sponsorship opportunities slowed down and their ad revenue decreased, so they need to find a way to diversify their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9MVHW4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where they are now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl2GVo"&gt;Gove-Humphries and Roper say their YouTube revenue is back, and they’re “thriving” on the platform now that everyone is stuck at home and streaming videos. They left the UK as soon as they could and traveled to Portugal where they own property and a barn, which they’ve focused on fixing up. This is the first time they’ve lived in a house in six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueQzug"&gt;“Owning the land where we are right now in Portugal was one of our best decisions because living in a van full-time, it’s all fine and well, but I always had that feeling that we never really belonged somewhere, like there was nowhere to fall back on,” says Gove-Humphries. “So having our own land where we can go, where we know that we’re not going to be moved on, or we know that we’re legally allowed to be here, is quite good. Even if you’re not here, it’s good for your mental health to know that you have got somewhere to fall back on, and this worked out brilliantly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8Tacj"&gt;Roper says multiple people they know, fellow vanlifers, looked into buying their own homes since the pandemic for this same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWmgdI"&gt;“It is quite scary when the whole world locks down, and you’ve got no way you’re allowed to be,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCCHVw"&gt;Still, they look forward to traveling again. Their original North America trip is still on the table, but they’re thinking it’ll happen in 2022 rather than next year, realistically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="f93KZY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katie Baki, yoga teacher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zXbe0j"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195288/zoom-yoga-online-classes-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Katie Baki was teaching at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UKRPbM"&gt;Katie Baki almost immediately started hosting donation-based yoga classes on Zoom when the studios she worked at shut down in March. She appreciated being able to see students’ practice when their cameras were on and being able to record classes for later. She managed to set the mood by emailing her students Spotify playlists so they could recreate the yoga class ambiance in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7aqyb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How classes have been going since then&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbb31X"&gt;Baki now teaches four classes remotely a week for her own clients and two classes for a virtual studio. Her clients have stuck with her throughout the pandemic, which she greatly appreciates, but she says finding new students is “seemingly impossible” without the reach of in-person classes. Plus, she now competes directly with bigger studios that can afford to charge less than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="az6K03"&gt;“I don’t know if it’s sustainable, to be completely honest,” she says. “I’m sure that there are ways, but the teachers that I’ve spoken with, every yoga teacher is struggling. A lot of them only teach once a week, and a lot of students expect them to be free classes, and our industry got hit really, really hard, and it’s been challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiGThQ"&gt;Zoom classes have more or less acted like a Band-Aid on a large wound for Baki, and she’s ready to get back to in-person classes. She might continue teaching a couple remotely for viewers outside of her area, but otherwise, in-person classes are where she feels both she and the students get the most benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ysEUd4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Savetsky, fashion influencer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MUzSxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21184344/coronavirus-covid-19-fashion-influencers-street-photography-instagram"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she was making fashion content at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Fdim"&gt;Elizabeth Savetsky’s fashion Instagram feed pivoted quickly when the pandemic took hold in the US. Instead of her usual glitzy looks and fun event photos, she posted herself with minimal makeup and her natural, wavy hair. She sang to her followers, who never knew she had a nice singing voice. She couldn’t rely on the same style or type of content she had been making previously, and couldn’t hire a photographer to help her take photos. At the same time, she had to strike the right tone and figure out what her followers wanted — they loved her luxurious, cool looks before, but would they still want that when they were all at home wearing sweatpants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TaRjjd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she’s adjusted to the pandemic’s fashion trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Yiq340"&gt;After months of being stuck at home, Savetsky says her followers seemingly want lighthearted, aspirational content again. She participated in her first professional photoshoots in around six months recently and says her followers crave a fantasy world where they could be dressing up and celebrating the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU1fEA"&gt;“People aren’t traveling,” she says. “People aren’t getting to do their normal holiday season glamorous gatherings and parties and all of that, and so to be able to give them a little bit of that on Instagram is, that’s kind of [my] angle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOH4JD"&gt;That’s only the Instagram grid, however. Savetsky says throughout the pandemic she’s given her followers a peek into her real life, and they likely will want that to continue. The brands want that, too. Savetsky says the brand deals are coming back to her account but now involve more focus on her struggles and day-to-day life. Her followers are buying from her posts, too, she says, which she thinks reflects the lack of spending in other areas of their lives, like travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ji5Him"&gt;“I feel like my audience really responds to this real factor. It’s nice to have the fantasy, but it’s not relatable, and people want to see your everyday life, especially when the world is hurting,” she says. “I think it’s kind of shown me that it’s not about the setting, or about the product, but it’s about me, and people wanting a window into my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fitbit acquisition wins EU approval</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SxDgsnWXxb9swTM4lSm-jT9mPc=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528743/20200919FitbitSense5.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Sense from Fitbit’s lineup of health tracking wearables.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KE6CG7"&gt;Google’s acquisition of Fitbit is nearing completion now that the European Commission has &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2484"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the search giant’s $2.1 billion takeover of the wearable tech company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxRykz"&gt;When Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement"&gt;announced the acquisition in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said that the Fitbit purchase was “an opportunity to invest even more in Wear OS as well as introduce Made by Google wearable devices into the market.” But regulators quickly got involved, and in August, they formally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353947/google-fitbit-acquisition-eu-investigation-antitrust-health-tracking-data"&gt;began investigating&lt;/a&gt; Google’s purchase of Fitbit over data privacy and antitrust concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggwqPE"&gt;In approving the deal, Google has now agreed to a number of concessions to ease EU concerns. Among the concessions, Google has agreed not to use Fitbit data, including GPS and health data, gathered from any user in the European Economic Area (EEA) for targeted advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a6zr5Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Fitbit deal clears one of its last major hurdles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U8n2vK"&gt;Additionally, the company is ordered to maintain a technical separation between its business and that of Fitbit’s and to give EEA users the option to approve or deny the use of Fitness health data to inform other Google services like its search engine and Google Maps product. The approval of the deal also stipulates that Google maintain commitments related to Fitbit’s Web API and its own Android API that foster competition. These commitments will be in place for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xd3w6J"&gt;“We can approve the proposed acquisition of Fitbit by Google because the commitments will ensure that the market for wearables and the nascent digital health space will remain open and competitive,” said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president, in a statement. “The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHmCNN"&gt;Australian regulators have also been looking into the acquisition. Late last month, &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/consultation-begins-on-proposed-google-fitbit-undertaking?utm_source=linkedin_accc&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google_fitbit_consultation"&gt;Australia’s Competition &amp;amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) published three Google concessions&lt;/a&gt; meant to allay competition and privacy concerns related to data collected by Fitbit and Google wearables for the purposes of advertising as well as long-term interoperability with Android phones and third-party apps and wearables. The ACCC is currently seeking feedback on the proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovPer1"&gt;In November, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google parent company Alphabet, said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-29/google-cfo-expects-fitbit-acquisition-to-clear-by-end-of-year"&gt;she expects the bid for Fitbit to be completed by the end of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEAjVd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
