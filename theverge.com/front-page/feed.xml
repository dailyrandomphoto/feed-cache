    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UGMYQs"&gt;We’re off and running in the year 2022 with new console restocks. While we’re all hoping that availability of the popular PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles opens up so anyone can buy a console at retail price whenever they choose, for now we have to keep our eyes peeled, remain vigilant, and keep our F5 keys ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfRm83"&gt;While GameStop finished off 2021 with a series of scheduled in-store selling events for new consoles — giving us a throwback to the old days of lining up outside of stores in person — the video game retailer now has Xbox Series X consoles available on its site to order. You can pick up an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock010321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-ultimate-games-and-system-bundle-with-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745Q.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X bundle&lt;/a&gt;, complete with &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, and a $50 GameStop gift card for $669.96.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNfqvK"&gt;GameStop’s new console bundles are usually limited to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock010321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop Pro subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, though this one is open to everyone. Remember that patience and persistence are often key with these console restocks. Don’t stop trying until it shows sold out. Though if luck is not on your side for this one, or if you don’t prefer a bundle, we’ll be sure to keep you updated on future console restocks at GameStop and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring Fit Adventure for Nintendo Switch is back down to its lowest price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2v1-e1krbsyoHH_Gmhk0RK4egk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70341795/akrales_191008_3706_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GPw13g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, the box set for the Nintendo Switch that includes the fitness adventure game along with a pilates ring that a Joy-Con slides into, is selling for just $54.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglfOk2zqUH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XV4NHHN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, matching the best price we’ve seen. It’s normally $85. Actually, it’s been selling for this price since Black Friday, but if your New Year’s resolutions include getting in shape, this game is a fun, effective way to stay moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPP9DP"&gt;The single-player campaign is actually a turn-based RPG where you fight against enemies by doing exercise reps. It tracks your form, making sure you don’t go too easy on yourself, though you can set the difficulty. Considering it’s a workout, it’s actually pretty fun. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3coVY"&gt;This game was in short supply and high demand earlier in the pandemic, and remarkably, prices soared over $250 — almost as much as the Nintendo Switch itself. But now, you can purchase it at a very reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t0D262"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Music" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YzNhqizOU8PmJ_TzMFZpDmCJuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141652/amazonmusic.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dtPdAX"&gt;Listeners who haven’t used Amazon Music Free before can get $5 of Amazon credit added to their accounts just by listening to one full track. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=hva_amf_gw_DeskGWcard_US_E_V2_1222?node=23681795011" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s the deal&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says you will be emailed your code within one week of your first stream, and it can be redeemed for up to 30 days on an Amazon purchase of $20 or more. Here’s &lt;a href="https://music.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ref_=sv_dmusic_8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a link to the web player&lt;/a&gt;, so you can stream a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kW6NlI"&gt;Clearly, Amazon wants people to try out the free tier of its music streaming service, but whether you have an alliance with Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, or some other service, it can’t hurt to give this a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iu_-r-2u58AoJ6EYQq4n1dD3Go8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22748660/ps5ssd1_1.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ilkcKU"&gt;If you’ve considered picking up an M.2 SSD that meets Sony’s PS5 requirements (it needs to support PCIe 4.0 and have a sequential read speed of 5,500MB/s or faster), this 1TB Western Digital WD_Black SN850 model makes the grade — and for a great price. Normally $269.99, it’s &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgdnZIRZ8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$189.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This WD_Black drive gets the nod over most other models because it already comes with a heatsink installed, which is another requirement for putting an M.2 SSD in your PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X74T8V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglf9t8c6r9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For another $10 (totaling $199.99)&lt;/a&gt;, you can get Samsung’s 1TB 980 Pro with a heatsink installed at Best Buy. It offers similarly fast performance (both drives claim up to 7,000MB/s sequential read speeds), though the WD_Black actually claims to be able to write a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;faster at up to 5,300MB/s compared to the 980 Pro’s 5,000MB/s write speed. Though, most people probably won’t notice a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe you have something you know you can’t live without. Either way, Apple’s AirTag tracker might be one of the best ways to keep tabs on your tech, bags, wallets, what have you. Best Buy is offering a rare deal on a single AirTag for today only. Usually deals are offered on multipacks, not just one, so this could be good for people who want to dip a toe into AirTags. Normally $29, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgivFu4uQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can grab one for $24&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7MfFtt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fExKJh"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini smart speaker (usually $99) includes a three-pack of Nanoleaf A19 smart bulbs that support Thread and Bluetooth &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgqpPv0sI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $139.98&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also Apple HomeKit-compatible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="umAaEN"&gt;Google’s second-gen Nest Hub smart display that makes for an excellent digital photo frame (and can also track your sleep via its Soli radar sensor) &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglgqV6ZQnw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $59.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It normally costs $99.99. We’ve seen this discount a handful of times, but now might be the perfect time for you to invest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H8OVLy"&gt;If you want a kooky laptop that’s in the keyboard-in-the-front club, forgoing wrist rests to make room for a &lt;em&gt;second display&lt;/em&gt;, check out Amazon’s deal on the Asus ZenBook Duo 14. Normally $1,299.99 for the model with a 14-inch FHD main screen, Intel’s 11th Gen Core i7-1195G7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-i7-1195G7-ScreenPad-Celestial-UX482EAR-DB71T/dp/B09F2S96XX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can grab it for $1,169.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Eve adds a smart floodlight cam and smart shades to its HomeKit portfolio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdBWPEv0fU-g8rTL3LqGnOj0CLc=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70341672/Eve_Outdoorcam_Motiv_Lifestyle_1_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam is a smart floodlight camera that works with HomeKit Secure Video.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxvEZW"&gt;Smart home company Eve Systems has announced its first outdoor camera and the availability of its Thread-powered smart shades at CES 2022 this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF23Mv"&gt;A floodlight camera designed for Apple HomeKit Secure Video, the $250 Eve Outdoor Cam, launches April 5th, 2022 and features 1080p video, a 157-degree field of view, infrared night vision, and infrared motion detection covering 100 degrees at distances of up to 30 feet. The Wi-Fi powered camera joins the &lt;a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-cam"&gt;Eve Cam&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s indoor camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elSas4"&gt;This is just the second HomeKit Secure Video-compatible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera"&gt;smart floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt; to launch; a floodlight camera is an outdoor security camera with motion-activated floodlights attached. The &lt;a href="https://www.netatmo.com/blog/en/security/camera-homekit-video-support/"&gt;Netatmo Outdoor Camera&lt;/a&gt; is the other currently available option (Arlo has a HomeKit floodlight camera, but it doesn’t work with HKSV). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOEYMh"&gt;There are a couple key hardware differences between these two HKSV cameras: The Eve version doesn’t have a siren, which is an option on the Netatmo one. But Eve does offer two-way communication with a built-in microphone and speaker, which the Netatmo does not. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STxdY6ERZgZdtTCxswbn2ZeGTeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132609/Eve_Outdoor_Cam_Solutionshot_wo_Badges.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam is compatible with the Apple Home app and the Eve app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oqg8CH"&gt;The Eve camera is also very small — just 6.7 inches high, 2.6 inches wide, and 6.3 inches deep. That’s smaller than the Netatmo, although they both share a similar aesthetic, ditching the traditional “googly” eyed look of floodlight cams (where the two lights are separate from the camera) in favor of a sleeker, more streamlined design with one built-in, high-powered light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av94pG"&gt;The disadvantage of this is you have less flexibility with positioning the floodlights. But Eve’s CEO Jerome Gackel tells The Verge the lights are “super bright,” although the exact lumens haven’t been disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QVIlFG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"THE BEST FLOODLIGHT CAMERA TO BUY RIGHT NOW ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uutItZ"&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam must be hardwired to your home’s electrical system, which is pretty standard for most floodlight cameras, and it works over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. It also requires a connection to a HomeKit home hub (such as an Apple TV or HomePod Mini) to process and store video recordings. The camera uses HomeKit Secure Video to store videos and processes all data locally. Live video isn’t transmitted to the cloud and recordings are encrypted and stored in your iCloud Plus account.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rEXCl"&gt;With an iCloud Plus account, users get 10 days of video history and the option of smart alerts for people, vehicles, pets, and packages. As a HomeKit camera, the Eve Cam can be accessed through the Home app as well as Eve’s own app. 			&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7W6J1a6YOWijLfXyhiTHPaqBOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132614/EVE_MOTIONBLINDS_Richmond_0100.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve MotionBlinds are smart motors inside Coulisse shades. They work with Apple HomeKit at launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YVNi6N"&gt;Eve launches first Thread-enabled smart shades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HcgeTx"&gt;Announced earlier this year, the eagerly anticipated Eve smart MotionBlinds go on sale today, January 3rd, 2022. Pricing varies based on fabric and size but starts at just under $400 per shade. They can be ordered through any Coulisse reseller, including &lt;a href="http://selectblinds.com"&gt;selectblinds.com&lt;/a&gt;, and you can install them yourself. Coulisse is a Netherlands-based manufacturer of window coverings, and a complete list of sellers can be found at &lt;a href="http://motionblinds.com/eve"&gt;motionblinds.com/eve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQSljo"&gt;The first Thread-powered smart shades (they also use Bluetooth), the Eve MotionBlinds are HomeKit compatible and “Matter-ready,” according to Gackel. As a refresher, Thread is a low-power mesh networking protocol that provides better speed and reliability than many of the current smart home protocols. It’s also a key part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, the new smart home standard coming in mid-2022&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to unify the smart home under one standard and help remove the confusion around which products work with which smart home platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOMGsU"&gt;Eve’s MotionBlinds will be available first as smart roller shades, with other styles coming soon. They’re compatible with HomeKit and Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, at launch, but aren’t the only HomeKit smart shades: Lutron, Hunter Douglas, and Ikea all offer HomeKit options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rohROD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Eve smart MotionBlinds|105402" data-volume-uuid="e4085e58c" data-volume-id="105402" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-61" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This video provided by Eve gives you a good, if glossy, look at what the MotionBlinds should look like in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jim9pp"&gt;The shades are powered by a rechargeable USB-C battery-powered motor, and uniquely for smart shades, have the option of manual control with a pull cord. There are also on-device schedules, so the shades can work independently of a smartphone app or smart home network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilMvd8"&gt;As Eve MotionBlinds work through HomeKit, they don’t require a separate bridge or gateway — which most smart window coverings do. However, they will need a HomeKit hub such as a HomePod Mini if you want to set up HomeKit automations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSXdhb"&gt;Smart shades are some of the most useful additions to a smart home, providing light and climate control plus an undeniable wow factor. But they are also very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbDAJO"&gt;Eve’s entry into the space isn’t a game-changer when it comes to price — it looks like the shades will be on par cost-wise with Lutron’s Serena line. However, because they work over the non-proprietary Thread protocol and will be compatible with Matter, these should be easier to integrate into your smart home than most of the existing offerings, which are largely locked into their own ecosystems. That is, once the standard arrives later this year. In the meantime, they are HomeKit only.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FfvhHo"&gt;Kohler’s long-touted PerfectFill technology is finally here, and frazzled parents everywhere can breathe a sigh of relief. The company announced the availability of its smart bath tech at CES 2022 this week, which lets you fill up a bathtub with a simple voice command. So, if you’re downstairs cooking dinner and want to get the kids’ bath going, you can just ask Alexa or Google to run the bath for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s5KFl"&gt;PerfectFill consists of drain kit and digital valve that work together to draw the bath to your preferred temperature and depth. So, no more worrying about flooding the bathroom because you forgot it was running or scalding junior when they jump in the bath. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4iI5BkHvDO3_9-ytdLlicOzP3PU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132135/KOHLER_PerfectFill_aad89901.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kohler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PerfectFill digital wall controller controls the system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BdpaU9"&gt;Bath time can be controlled by the Kohler Konnect app, as well as via voice, and there’s the option to program up to 10 different bath times, so everyone in the house can have it their way (even Fido).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKKoVI"&gt;PerfectFill doesn’t just fill, however, you can also drain the tub with a voice or app command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh8EmF"&gt;All this control will cost you, though. PerfectFill starts at $2,700; that doesn’t include a Kohler spout and compatible Kohler bath. It also needs to be professionally installed. PerfectFill will be available to order in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UboPUDE9Wwmxh14rbpHmU1YO4Wo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132138/KOHLER_Stillness_aad47857.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kohler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stillness Bath is an immersive smart bathtub that starts at $8,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GPy8Kn"&gt;If that’s not enough tech for your bath time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218786/kohler-smart-stillness-bath-amazon-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;Kholer’s Stillness Bath, which was teased at CES last year&lt;/a&gt;, will be available to purchase in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adfloU"&gt;The smart bathing experience starts at $8,000 and incorporates that PerfectFill tech in a smart bathtub that combines water, light, fog, and aroma to create an “at home spa-like experience,” according to Kohler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIjPCPMuCq3KHU6dXV0cp9FJXu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132142/aad53283_rgb_JPG_3000_pixels_wide___300dpi.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kohler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Purist Suspend brings Bluetooth control via a remote (also pictured) to your kitchen faucet while ditching counter clutter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qessik"&gt;If an $8,000 smart spa bath still isn’t enough, you can take it up a notch with the Infinity Experience model that adds the option to have the water flow over the edges and into a hinoki wood base, adding that trickling waterfall sound to your relaxation experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8haRca"&gt;The whole system is controlled by the Kohler Konnect app, and the lower-end $8,000 freestanding bath will be available in Q1 2022. The other models are coming in Q3, prices still to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgcmFV"&gt;For more hands-free water control, Kohler is also debuting a kitchen faucet that’s suspended from the ceiling and controlled by a waterproof, battery-operated Bluetooth puck. The Purist Suspend can be operated by the puck-shaped remote to turn the faucet on and off and adjust the temperature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uloN0"&gt;The main concept here — beyond being quite the statement piece — is reducing counter clutter. With Suspend, your kitchen faucet will no longer be in the way when you’re washing dishes (was it really ever?). The faucet hangs from the ceiling and has 180 degree rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21GFs0"&gt;Also announced at CES 2021 and coming to market this year is Kohler’s smart water monitor, H2Wise powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/8/16860174/belkin-phyn-plus-smart-water-monitor-leak-tracking-pressure-sensors-ces-2018"&gt;Phyn&lt;/a&gt;. The H2Wise and H2Wise Plus (a professionally installed version) will launch in January for $400 and $667, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KiPeVMdzpKZcMUHs9PZRBvczmMw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132149/KOHLER_H2Wise_aad70721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kohler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The H2Wise is a smart water monitor that can be installed by a homeowner. A pro-install version adds the ability to shut off the water remotely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="twIZDi"&gt;The H2Wise Plus is installed at the main water line and can be set to shut off water through the app if a leak is detected. The H2Wise can be installed by a homeowner under a sink. Both units require a 110v / 220v power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmYT4O"&gt;Both these gadgets monitor water use throughout every fixture in your home and can notify you of a water leak as well as help monitor water use. A pre-freeze warning uses pressure sensing to warn you before a pipe freezes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLxLLf"&gt;The H2Wise monitor is controlled by the Kohler Konnect app and can be paired with Alexa or Google voice assistants. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHzRJebafCuj7n0Us2JtO0jh3IM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132155/ROBERN_IQ_Digital_Lock_Box_aad08644_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kohler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Robern IQ Digital Lock Box is an app-controlled mini safe designed for bathroom cabinets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RS0oux"&gt;Other smart products Kohler announced at CES 2022 include the Robern IQ Digital Lock Box — a smart lock box that fits in a bathroom vanity cabinet for storing medication and personal items. Designed for Robern cabinets, it can be adjusted to install in any vanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6TqDF"&gt;The Digital Lock Box costs $449 and has a touchpad panel as well as an app (iOS and Android) to set and protect your password, view entry logs, and receive alerts when the box is opened. Users can also set a schedule and add daily medication reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ja-N5VLnJOOII9IiKaHrPZgjSJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132165/KOHLER_Mistos_Touchless__aad62894.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kohler’s new touchless faucets for the bathroom are controlled with a wave of the hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvr7he"&gt;Also in the bathroom space, Kohler is launching a line of Touchless Residential Bathroom Faucets starting at $199 that you turn on and off with the wave of a hand. A twist top controls temperature and an auto shut-off feature turns the flow off after two minutes. The faucet also has a vacation mode and is battery operated for an easier install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6f99nb"&gt;Finally, the Kohler Power Reserve is a modular home energy storage system that pairs with solar power systems to store solar energy regardless of the weather, time of day, or status of the grid. Using the Kohler Power Reserve mobile app to monitor and control the system, users can set the storage system to backup, self supply, time of use, or custom. Pricing starts at $13,325 for a 10kWh system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s Concept Nyx aims to let you cast your PC games to any screen you own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware Concept Nyx" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I-HIgPptN7DXRmBQu7Ko0j7bTj4=/0x0:1494x996/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340920/nyxmain.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contrary to this image, Concept Nyx squeezes both screens down in size to make the full playing space for each game viewable.&lt;/em&gt; | Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fLz1HK"&gt;For CES 2022, Alienware is showing off its Concept Nyx, which imagines a future when loading and playing games on a variety of screens can happen as instantaneously as streaming music and TV shows. The idea is simple on its face (though undoubtedly complex underneath the veil): through the Nyx software, all of your PC games would be available to stream wirelessly to a variety of screens at home, regardless of where you bought them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rr82iA"&gt;Imagine you’re playing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on your PC display, but you want to move over to the living room couch and play on a big TV. The idea is that you’d be able to tap a button in an app, and the game would wirelessly swap displays, letting you hog the TV all to yourself or have your game squeeze next to another in a split-view mode. Alienware is working to make it possible to stream up to four games at once. Alienware demoed Nyx to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; with repurposed Concept UFO controllers that we last saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;at CES 2020 attached to a Switch-like tablet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware Concept Nyx" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2mQbUcIO-IZA0rigKWGz4O6d3JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121514/cfaulkner_141231_4944_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the main hub looks like in Concept Nyx, though it could change if it develops into a product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M7ohaG"&gt;In the conceptual phase, Nyx requires a machine that’s powerful enough to run multiple games at once, with networking chops to handle distributing low-latency streams. It’s unclear whether Alienware intends to release its own hardware, when that might be, how much it might cost, and whether what Nyx aims to do will be a paid service. There are clearly a lot of questions for which Alienware needs to provide answers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware Concept Nyx" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jq3-bAOYnZEL_paUTXAtF56w8zM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121516/cfaulkner_141231_4944_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While still in concept, Nyx worked as intended in our joint session of Cyberpunk 2077 and Rocket League.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LchVo3"&gt;But compared to the likes of Google Stadia and Amazon Luna, Concept Nyx seems built to make accessing and playing your already-owned PC games even easier, with a similar level of device compatibility and, perhaps, fewer compromises in terms of visual quality. In a way, it’s remarkably similar to what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22310321/valve-steam-linux-steam-link-remote-play-together-account"&gt;Valve is already doing with its Remote Play Anywhere feature&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay#anywhere"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;, to boot. Though, where Nyx intends to differentiate itself is with handling more streams at once and pulling in games from multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9dg7Q"&gt;It was encouraging that Alienware was actually able to pull off the Nyx demo for us successfully, swapping between multiple displays with just a few seconds in between the pass-off from screen to screen. But we’ll need to try it at home and not in a controlled environment to see if it’s ready for the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s latest Frame TVs have a matte screen that looks and feels more like real art</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7pti1IzGKU4LrtsTculYgC4bh_k=/0x7:2040x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340515/SamsungFrame2022.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mRDDxG"&gt;Samsung has managed to single-handedly define the category of “lifestyle TVs” — high-design TV sets that blend into the home more seamlessly than traditional TVs — with The Frame. I’ve got several friends, coworkers, and family members who have recently purchased some model in The Frame lineup. For them, the device’s stylish look, customizable bezels, and ability to showcase artwork or personal photos when the TV is “off” are more important than the latest picture quality or HDMI specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUzUz"&gt;For 2022, the company is hoping to take The Frame to the next level and make its wall art parlor trick more convincing than ever before. Samsung says the latest models will have a matte, anti-reflective display with a “lifelike” texture that feels like canvas or paper to the touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cBys9"&gt;The anti-reflective display could be a huge draw for consumers; The Frame is able to match the white balance and brightness of artwork based on ambient lighting in a room, but if there’s one thing that gives away the fact that you’re still looking at a TV, it’s screen glare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3JudfSItHKN7I6XRMtd34f9Mlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23141061/samsungtheframe.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of last year’s Frame pitted against the new matte-screened model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vdHjgc"&gt;By introducing a new anti-reflective film and other anti-glare measures, Samsung hopes that oil pantings and other art will pop off the screen to a more impressive extent than before. Unfortunately I haven’t had a chance to see the new anti-reflective displays in person just yet to see how convincing the end result is — or whether there’s any negative effect on the picture when watching regular content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiYoYf"&gt;The company’s art store offers over 1,600 pieces, and Frame owners can expect a new, more refined user experience in 2022 when browsing that selection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCG2k1"&gt;For 2022, The Frame will be offered in a total of seven different sizes, starting at 32 inches at the small end and topping out with an 85-inch model. As for the tech specs of the TV itself, they sound similar to last year: The Frame will give you a nice 4K HDR picture with an expanded quantum dot color palette and even 120Hz 4K gaming, but it lacks some other features like full-array local dimming, and Samsung continues to ignore Dolby Vision completely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiEO3u97yym1rg5bHjAYAtFQkRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140162/Screen_Shot_2022_01_02_at_12.45.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Based on Samsung’s claims, this guy wouldn’t be seeing much glare on the new Frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EyJUrG"&gt;If image quality is your main priority, the company’s top-tier Neo QLED sets (with Mini LED tech) are still the way to go. But that’s not what The Frame is for. This model — and Samsung’s other lifestyle models like The Serif — are for people who want a perfectly acceptable picture in a package that complements their home decor instead of clashing with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1hES6"&gt;Pricing, release info, and more detailed tech specs for the 2022 Frame lineup should be announced closer to when the TVs begin shipping in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnhHtY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 3rd, 8:05AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article originally stated that Samsung’s Frame TVs don’t support a 120Hz refresh rate, but that capability was added last year and is again included in 2022. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung promises ‘groundbreaking’ new TV feature: NFT support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTgYFV3oCz-_ctXyMIwvT3rh7W0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340516/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGT2os"&gt;Staring at your non-fungible tokens on a smartphone or laptop screen is fine and all, but why not remind everyone who visits your home of the money you spent on digital art NFTs by showcasing them on your TV screen? Somehow we’re in a world where that’s about to become reality: Samsung says it’s planning extensive support for NFTs beginning with its 2022 TV lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVGvQT"&gt;“With demand for NFTs on the rise, the need for a solution to today’s fragmented viewing and purchasing landscape has never been greater,” the company said in a press release. “In 2022, Samsung is introducing the world’s first TV screen-based NFT explorer and marketplace aggregator, a groundbreaking platform that lets you browse, purchase, and display your favorite art — all in one place.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xIZQoUACx3vNlz3G26aD-0Yhqec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132567/Samsung_NFT_Aggregation_Platform.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A preview of Samsung’s upcoming NFT TV platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NnF6vh"&gt;According to Samsung, this platform (shown above) will let creators “share their art with the world” and let potential buyers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JvZNsL"&gt;Preview an NFT before purchasing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4rPEVg"&gt;Learn about an NFT’s history and blockchain metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NlZTbd"&gt;Samsung is also minding the details when it comes to viewing NFTs on its 2022 televisions. A smart calibration feature on the TVs will automatically adjust display settings “to the creator’s preset values, so you can have peace of mind that your work looks impeccable, with true-to-the-original image quality.” You’ve heard of things like Dolby Vision or Netflix Calibrated Mode, and now NFTs will get a similar treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wiUCHj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OH3vKf"&gt;More details on the NFT platform should be made available as the 2022 TVs start shipping in the coming months. With today’s news, Samsung becomes the first major TV manufacturer to support NFTs to such a significant degree. Are we witnessing the kickoff of a trend? Is there no going back? Might your next Roku or Amazon Fire TV also come with some level of NFT integration? Stay tuned to our coverage of CES 2022 to see whether other companies follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new TV remote uses radio waves from your router to stay charged</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MYb9Qc"&gt;CES is always a moment when companies reiterate their dedication to environmental causes and trumpet their latest, more efficient products and packaging. After introducing a solar-powered Eco Remote for its 2021 TVs, Samsung is back again with a new version that comes with a pretty fascinating trick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7Jvoj"&gt;Like the previous Eco Remote, this one can be charged with solar energy, but Samsung has also added RF harvesting capabilities that let the remote preserve its charge by “collecting routers’ radio waves and converting them to energy.” Neat. You don’t see this in many gadgets — mostly because it’s really only practical for low-power devices. But remotes certainly fall into that category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvwnDe"&gt;Aside from the new RF harvesting option, the Eco Remote can be charged from both outdoor and indoor light or (for the fastest results) over USB-C.  Samsung says it’s introducing a white model of the remote this year, which the company says is meant to better complement its “lifestyle” TVs like The Frame, Serif, and Sero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIFkJB"&gt;As with the original remote, the intention here is to ditch AAA batteries. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/preserving-our-planet-2-making-tv-accessories-more-sustainable"&gt;Samsung has previously estimated&lt;/a&gt; that switching to solar-powered remotes could avoid 99 million discarded batteries over the course of seven years. It has also explored other ways of self-charging the internal battery such as “harnessing the kinetic energy that’s created when the remote is shaken” and “using the vibrational energy that’s created when the microphone picks up sounds.” But this time around it settled on adding RF harvesting as another way to keep the clicker functioning whenever you need it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new 2022 TVs bring Nvidia GeForce Now and Google Stadia gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcTXnzZmz1F6JaBapQFNvp-N-dY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340511/GAMINGHUB_LANDINGPAGE_3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new “Samsung Gaming Hub”  | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1u6XKr"&gt;Samsung is revealing a new lineup of smart TVs at CES 2022 today, including features as exotic as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22624431"&gt;radio-wave powered remote controls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22622739"&gt;support for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; — and they also happen to be the first Samsung sets in a while to let you play triple-A video games from the cloud instead of just your Xbox, PlayStation or PC. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747063/samsung-cloud-gaming-service-tizen-tv-announcement"&gt;After an vague tease in October&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is now confirming that “select” 2022 models will explicitly offer access to Nvidia’s GeForce Now, Google Stadia, and the Utomik cloud gaming service as part of a new “Samsung Gaming Hub,” a user interface which Samsung’s intending to expand to additional services as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNY3Gz"&gt;The Samsung Gaming Hub isn’t just for cloud gaming, either. Intriguingly, the company says that your HDMI-connected video game consoles will be part of it as well — complete with passthrough controller inputs. That means you might be able to play cloud games and console games with the same controller, instead of having to maintain separate controllers or pair back and forth, with both PlayStation and Xbox controllers supported at launch. It’s also promising “AI Gaming technology” that will create curated game recommendations on your TV’s home screen, which... okay, sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIPHjV"&gt;It’s interesting to see TV manufacturers embrace cloud gaming again, after a bit of a lapse. While LG and Samsung both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3066544/samsung-gaikai-cloud-gaming-service"&gt;competed for the rights to stream games from Gaikai and OnLive back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/9/8752917/playstation-now-samsung-smart-tv-launch"&gt;Samsung TVs offered Sony’s PlayStation Now&lt;/a&gt; between 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14626676/playstation-now-discontinued-ps3-vita-smart-tvs"&gt;and 2017&lt;/a&gt;, it’s only this winter that LG and Samsung are back in the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22823092/google-stadia-comes-to-lg-smart-tv-webos-5-6"&gt;with Nvidia and Google’s services.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9HkDB"&gt;It’s not clear whether Samsung’s TVs will offer the best picture and audio quality for cloud gaming quite yet, as the company was unable to say whether either GeForce Now or Google Stadia would offer 4K streaming. “We are working with partners to bring their best levels of service to our platform,” reads part of a statement from Samsung gaming product director Mike Lucero to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We will be announcing details as we get closer to launch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oe04l6"&gt;If you’ve got an earlier Samsung Smart TV, there’s also no telling whether you’ll get access to any of these features. “We are starting with our 2022 models and are working to make the Gaming Hub available to even more Samsung customers,” writes Lucero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71nY73"&gt;It’s interesting to me that Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming, aka xCloud, isn’t part of this launch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134167/microsoft-samsung-xbox-partnership-xcloud-cloud-game-streaming"&gt;Microsoft and Samsung prominently partnered on cloud gaming&lt;/a&gt; in February 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514030/microsoft-xcloud-samsung-smart-fridge-doom-enternal-xbox-games-android"&gt;and we got xCloud on a smart fridge&lt;/a&gt; and some Samsung Android phones, but the Xbox app for smart TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612714/microsoft-xbox-app-tv-xcloud-streaming-app"&gt;that Phil Spencer told us about in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t materialized yet. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud"&gt;only got a brief mention last June&lt;/a&gt; ahead of — instead of during — the E3 2021 video game expo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NnkDm"&gt;Samsung Smart TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15930676/samsung-smart-tv-4k-steam-link-streaming-games"&gt;have offered a Steam Link app&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but Lucero tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it won’t be part of this Gaming Hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxVqQh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, 9:37 PM ET: Samsung says that GeForce Now, Stadia and Utomik will be offered via the hub, but will not come preinstalled on the TVs as we initially implied. Also, Samsung adds that Xbox and PlayStation controllers will be among those supported for passthrough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s 2022 TV lineup has big software changes, smaller hardware upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4k6f_sUcRqq9BGS5n3lZDjkpZW4=/91x0:1950x1239/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70340521/samsung2022tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UoYJj"&gt;Samsung introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;first TVs with Mini LED technology&lt;/a&gt; at CES 2021, and they wound up being perhaps the best sets that the company has produced yet — not counting the exorbitantly priced The Wall, that is. So this year, Samsung is opting for a different approach: it’s taking smaller strides in hardware and focusing more of its efforts on software refinement and new features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mbvehv"&gt;Samsung’s 2022 TVs will continue to run the company’s Tizen OS, but they’ll now come with a totally revamped home screen that’s described as “a testament to our vision for the future of TVs.” The first part of the new user experience is what Samsung calls the Media Screen. This will “put all of your streaming service content into one, easy-to-browse place” with a continue watching section that aggregates content “from any provider” — so Samsung claims, anyway. There will of course be personalized recommendations as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wmmgmGC5G799fstyRFt19PjCBSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140148/2022smarthub.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung has redesigned its TV home screen for 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3XHl6F"&gt;It all sounds very similar to Google TV and the Apple TV app; everyone wants to be your main portal for browsing entertainment, leaving streaming apps just to play the movies and shows you want to watch. The streaming services don’t always love this strategy; Netflix in particular has a history of pushing back against letting others curate its content, and as a result doesn’t participate in either Google TV &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208083"&gt;or the Apple TV app&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfokFR"&gt;Here are some other software additions coming in 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xIK4ks"&gt;Watch Together: Samsung is expanding its multi-view feature to deliver what it claims is “the world’s first TV-based platform for experiencing live and streaming content with friends and family” remotely. You’ll be able to plug in a USB video camera or even use a smartphone or tablet’s camera for video chatting with those you’re watching with. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BFHA4L"&gt;NFT aggregation platform: Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22622739"&gt;NFTs are coming to the living room&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung’s the first major TV manufacturer to significantly put its weight behind NFTs. The company says it will provide “a groundbreaking platform that lets you browse, purchase, and display your favorite art — all in one place.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="psoSgM"&gt;MicroLED TVs come in new sizes, remain out of reach for normal people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ijK0KY"&gt;Samsung is producing new models of its MicroLED displays that debuted several years ago as The Wall. For 2022, the company says MicroLED displays are now “bezel-free.” As always, the modular panel technology allows (extremely wealthy) customers to configure whatever screen size works best for their situation — topping out at an enormous 178 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KIWbj7gfdIxEmGPf3woJslEFwyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140137/samsungmicro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s ultra-luxury MicroLED displays now have a bezel-free design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kvZRve"&gt;Aside from the custom jobs, Samsung also offers pre-made models of MicroLED TVs in 99- and 110-inch sizes. For 2022, the company is adding an 89-inch MicroLED TV to that lineup. There’s no pricing info as of yet, but you can expect MicroLED to continue to cost far more than even the nicest, biggest OLEDs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzhHsb"&gt;As a refresher, MicroLED shares many properties with OLED — the microscopic LEDs deliver self-emissive, pixel-level light control — but doesn’t come with the same downsides (like the “organic” part that can limit a panel’s lifespan or potentially lead to burn-in). It could succeed OLED if prices ever come down, but 2022 certainly won’t be the year that happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Se9MYG"&gt;Samsung’s Mini LED TVs now look even better when bright&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EQjUEi"&gt;Since this will be just the second year that Samsung offers Mini LED 8K and 4K TVs as part of its “Neo QLED” line, the company isn’t making drastic hardware changes. And it doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to, since last year’s sets represented a significant step up in contrast, black levels, and gaming performance. Samsung says it has “increased the luminance scale from a 12-bit to a 14-bit backlight — delivering significantly more accurate brightness” for the 2022 models. It calls this 14-bit HDR Mapping. And the TVs now use AI to analyze a scene and better separate the foreground subject from the background, creating a greater sense of depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exSt9h"&gt;Additionally, AI also helps produce adaptive “shapes of light” with the many backlight dimming zones to cut down on blooming and enhance brightness and contrast. Combined with 14-bit HDR Mapping, Samsung says this will bring out details that weren’t so obvious on last year’s Neo QLED TVs and make details pop more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwL8As"&gt;Sadly Samsung still isn’t getting on board with Dolby Vision in 2022. Maybe next year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BXBhSp51O1A0c68sZtxS6Xs2qpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23140144/SamsungNEOQLED.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung says its 2022 Neo QLED TVs will feature improved depth and expanded 14-bit HDR Mapping. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oPuk56"&gt;For the PC gaming crowd, Samsung says select models of its 2022 TV lineup will be capable of variable refresh rates up to 144Hz — up from 120Hz — and will be among the first TVs to support &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/free-sync"&gt;AMD’s FreeSync Premium Pro&lt;/a&gt;. All HDMI ports on the higher-end TVs will be 2.1 and support 4K 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADcueW"&gt;Most significant of all, the company is adding a new, more comprehensive Gaming Hub to this year’s TVs as another piece of the software improvements. My colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22626855"&gt;covers that feature more here&lt;/a&gt;. On last year’s models, Samsung had a gaming bar that let you see a game’s FPS or quickly adjust important next-gen gaming settings, but the new hub goes further and aims to be an all-in-one destination for both console and cloud gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWcRtp"&gt;The upper-end TVs come with a bundle of audio features like Active Voice Amplifier, Object Tracking Sound (to make it seem like sound is actually coming out of the screen), and SpaceFit Sound for automatic calibration. But as ever, Samsung would prefer you pair its 2022 TVs with a range of soundbars and other home theater gear &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-2022-micro-led-neo-qled-lifestyle-tvs-personalization-options-ces-2022/?utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ces2022"&gt;it’s also announcing at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for further coverage as all of the company’s latest products get closer to shipping in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
