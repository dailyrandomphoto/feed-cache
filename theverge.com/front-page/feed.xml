    <title>Ubisoft is bringing its subscription service to Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If73GbKutkDlqZ5UgxFH0V6CK98=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350832/Ubisoft__Rebranding.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CaUdBU"&gt;Ubisoft is bringing its Ubisoft Plus subscription service to Xbox in the future, and announcing that &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Extraction &lt;/em&gt;will be coming to Xbox Game Pass at launch. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus%2F%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F5%2F22868704%2Fubisoft-plus-xbox-launch-rainbow-six-extraction-xbox-game-pass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ubisoft Plus&lt;/a&gt; originally launched for PC and includes access to more than 100 Ubisoft games, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, for $14.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNv8yX"&gt;Ubisoft isn’t announcing exactly when its subscription service will arrive on Xbox, only that it “will be coming to Xbox in the future,” &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6swN56EyVYT97D6r1sFwZE"&gt;according to Ubisoft community manager&lt;/a&gt; Daniel O’Connor. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428764/xbox-game-pass-ea-play-subscription"&gt;added EA’s Play subscription service to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; and PC Game Pass in 2020, but it’s not clear if Ubisoft’s service will be bundled with any Xbox Game Pass tiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU3syZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Extraction &lt;/em&gt;is also launching on day one with Xbox Game Pass, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate when it releases on January 20th. It’s the first major addition to Xbox Game Pass for 2022, after Microsoft revealed earlier this week that &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Anacrusis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Spelunky 2 &lt;/em&gt;are &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/04/coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-january-2022/"&gt;making their way to Xbox Game Pass soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7NvjH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Extraction &lt;/em&gt;is a tactical first-person shooter that allows friends to form a squad of up to three players or play solo fighting off what’s described as an “unpredictable” player vs. enemies experience. &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six: Extraction &lt;/em&gt;launches on January 20th on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC is launching a VR wrist tracker for its Vive Focus 3 headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HTC Vive Focus 3 Wrist Tracker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emgRgxe0AGVrBpCB6BbYN4kcZu4=/428x0:2959x1687/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350785/VIVE_Wrist_Tracker_kv.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HTC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9QPkJL"&gt;HTC is announcing a new wrist-based controller for its Vive Focus 3 virtual reality headset. The wireless Vive Wrist Tracker fits like a watch around a user’s arm, tracking the orientation and position from hand to elbow. It’s designed to complement the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588917/htc-vive-focus-3-vr-headset-review"&gt;business-focused headset’s&lt;/a&gt; existing controllers, particularly for simulation and training experiences where body position is important. It’s also part of a larger suite of new features HTC revealed at CES, including a 5G-powered VR experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2zmIZ"&gt;The Wrist Tracker looks a lot like a small, light, and specialized version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172022/htc-vive-tracker-vr-motion-tracker-adapter"&gt;Vive Tracker device&lt;/a&gt; HTC debuted in 2017. It includes a strap and a toggle indicating whether the tracker should be on a left or right arm, but unlike the multi-buttoned Vive Focus 3 controllers, it’s designed to basically connect to the headset wirelessly and transmit movement data, without the need for the headset’s cameras to see it. (You can also attach it to inanimate objects.) The VR training company Flaim describes using it to ensure that people were holding a virtual fire extinguisher in the correct position — something you couldn’t necessarily determine with a handheld controller alone — and Taser maker Axon will apparently integrate it into &lt;a href="https://www.axon.com/news/about/vr-simulator-training"&gt;the company’s VR training system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vive Focus 3 Wrist Tracker" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ETqw192icv7_Z57KNswcHI1jik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147351/VIVE_Wrist_Tracker_open_4_bg.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aUqIO6"&gt;While HTC didn’t list a price for the tracker, it will launch in the first quarter of 2022. Like the Vive Tracker and the $1,300 Vive Focus 3, it’s not designed for consumers, and it will be most valuable with experiences that are designed specifically to take advantage of it. But it’s also one of the less exotic accessories HTC has developed — a category that includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323093/htc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price"&gt;sophisticated lip tracking device&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP7cJx"&gt;HTC likewise announced the launch of what it’s calling a “portable, private 5G experience” in partnership with Lumen Technologies. It’s an application that’s run on the Vive Focus 3 but offloads most of the actual data processing to a remote computer and streams it through a private 5G system via Lumen. Mobile VR is a long-standing potential use case for 5G networks since experiences can require a lot of computational power delivered with low latency to headsets — although, so far, it hasn’t been transformational in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaqAE5"&gt;At CES, the company also announced a charging case and an accessory for charging multiple batteries at a time, aimed at location-based entertainment providers like arcades that want to quickly swap out batteries for multiple headsets. Location-based entertainment providers have used wired HTC headsets for some time, but the Vive Focus 3 promises to be more convenient, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22777266/htc-vive-focus-3-vr-headset-location-based-entertainment-mode-arcade-update"&gt;a series of software updates&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 Digital Edition is available right now at Best Buy (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_XhTQQpVqV7dFaeGQeKySBaVWDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350465/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uC7IsM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 5th, 11:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Both versions of Sony’s console are on sale at Best Buy, although availability will vary by location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThoCo4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 5th, 12:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of PlayStation 5 consoles for now. We are continuing to monitor further console restocks from Best Buy and other retailers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCWjoE"&gt;If you’re currently shopping for a PlayStation 5 console, you have another chance right now at Best Buy. The electronics retailer just opened up a fresh batch of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 consoles for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;, and as of 11:40AM ET, also started selling the even-harder-to-get &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgl92e6Q6zH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4DCfC"&gt;Be sure to log in and queue up on Best Buy’s site, with your billing and shipping info saved. Click the “Add to Cart” button on the right to jump into the waiting line, and stay calm. You don’t need to refresh the automated system, though, you may be prompted to verify your account when it’s your turn. Best Buy’s recently-updated queue system may not work well if you try to open multiple tabs, but keep your phone handy — if you have trouble verifying your account you may be able to do it in the mobile app and check out once the PlayStation 5 is in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSq4pr"&gt;After that, you should be able to see if there are any PS5 consoles available for pickup at stores in your area. If you strike out, stay vigilant, the store tends to restock in waves so there may be more consoles in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1URumo"&gt;We are continuing to track restocks as they roll out at various retailers. Be sure to also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to the &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest tech and gadget savings we can find and deliver right to your inbox twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kRs6ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall may not pay off at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="xvWX9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="82lPGd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UAvH7w"&gt;We’re wishing you all of the luck in getting a PS5 today. As usual, signing into your account ahead of the restock, and making sure that all of the pertinent shipping and payment info, can only help your chances of success. But generally, once you’re in the queue for a console, just hang tight and maybe cross those fingers that you actually get a console today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MWcsCA"&gt;Some must-have PS5 accessories and games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1BKh8"&gt;Whether you end up getting a PlayStation 5 today or not, it might not be a bad idea to stock up on some essentials that you may want to have on Day One with your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ryKE4I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Walmart and FedEx ordering thousands of electric delivery vans from GM’s BrightDrop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_UOtab-YESVF3oet70Hdq3qvMo=/0x0:8688x5792/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350769/22_3271_0146.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZEAoVw"&gt;Walmart struck a deal with General Motors-backed BrightDrop to reserve 5,000 of the company’s electric delivery vans, the companies announced today. The retail giant says it will integrate the EVs into its fleet in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Bwbq0"&gt;BrightDrop, which is GM’s dedicated electric delivery spinoff, will sell to Walmart both of its vehicles: the EV600 and the EV410. The EV600, which went into production last fall, has 600 cubic feet of cargo space, can travel up to 250 miles on a full battery, and has a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds. The smaller EV410 features 400 cubic feet of cargo space and can cover 250 miles on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="glL3o9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FedEx is expanding its order with BrightDrop&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gvZBem"&gt;Meanwhile, FedEx is expanding its order with BrightDrop, reserving an additional 2,000 vans that it will add to its fleet over the next few years. FedEx has previously said it would buy 500 vehicles from BrightDrop and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22839470/fedex-gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-van-ev600"&gt;recently took delivery of the first five vans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFoPV1"&gt;To be sure, neither of these deals are exclusive, and both FedEx and Walmart have said they may be interested in purchasing EVs from different companies. “We’re talking to BrightDrop and leaning into their expertise,” said FedEx executive vice president Richard Smith in a call with reporters. “But we’re not exclusive with anybody when it comes to rolling out the infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLeP0n"&gt;In addition to BrightDrop, Ford, Rivian, and Arrival are all working on their own electric vans for commercial customers. Amazon has said it would buy vans from Rivian and Stellantis, while UPS is interested in Arrival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1sivN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557603/cruise-walmart-autonomous-vehicles-delivery-arizona"&gt;Walmart is also conducting trials with Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, GM’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary. Cruise has made deliveries to 2,700 Walmart customers in Scottsdale, Arizona last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors claims it will sell autonomous vehicles to consumers by ‘middle of decade’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ja8KBps4KqvuQSt2T5mjQgtPzto=/0x2:6144x4098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350767/GM_Cruise_AV.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: GM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dUz7Nc"&gt;General Motors is going to sell fully autonomous vehicles to regular people by the middle of the decade, the company’s CEO Mary Barra declared during her speech at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show. It was a bold claim that is sure to cause waves in the auto industry, especially as it continues to grapple with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;its own over-inflated expectations&lt;/a&gt; about the future of driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3IeVJ"&gt;Barra didn’t offer further details about the kind of vehicle it will sell, which markets it will target, how it will address liability in the event of a crash, and most importantly, whether owners will be able to sleep in their autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhppUr"&gt;To date, there are no self-driving cars for sale to consumers as personally owned vehicles. Autonomous vehicles, which are outfitted with multiple sensors and high-powered computer systems, are very expensive to develop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AkoI8X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To date, there are no self-driving cars for sale to consumers as personally owned vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gfthtk"&gt;Most AV companies are choosing to deploy their vehicles as part of fleets of autonomous taxis as a way to defray the enormous hardware and software costs associated with highly automated driving. Other companies, like Tesla, claim their vehicles are “self-driving,” but in reality, they are only equipped with Level 2 advanced driver assist systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0TRFN"&gt;Many experts assume that autonomous vehicles will eventually be sold to consumers but at a much later date, when the manufacturing costs have declined and the margins are more favorable to a company’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZpoos"&gt;But GM claims that date is coming sooner than anticipated. Barra said customers may be able to purchase their own autonomous vehicle “as soon as the middle of the decade,” which implies 2025 at the earliest. More importantly, GM is giving itself a deadline, which may or may not work out to their advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EAkW5b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Last month, Barra forced out Cruise CEO Dan Ammann over disagreements on the direction of the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWTSKt"&gt;Previously, GM-backed Cruise missed its deadline to launch a full-scale robotaxi service in San Francisco by the end of 2019. The company has said it expects to launch the service in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtlB5u"&gt;Last month, Barra forced out Cruise CEO Dan Ammann over disagreements on the direction of the company. &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/executives/why-gms-mary-barra-dismissed-cruise-ceo-daniel-ammann"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Barra was pushing to use Cruise’s technology to power luxury self-driving Cadillacs that could be sold to customers. Ammann was reportedly open to the idea but wanted to prioritize Cruise’s robotaxi service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS7Tcn"&gt;Later this year, GM is planning to start production of the Cruise Origin, a purpose-built autonomous shuttle without traditional controls like a steering wheel and pedals. GM had previously planned to produce a version of its electric Chevy Bolt without steering wheels and pedals but has since put that plan on hold while it prioritizes the Origin. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors announces electric versions of the Chevy Equinox and Blazer SUVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoY6k5oPb8XN_teKSpHB6ALD3bw=/234x0:5466x3488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350761/2024_Chevrolet_Equinox_EV_001.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLLJBU"&gt;General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced electric versions of the automaker’s Chevy Equinox and Blazer SUVs, both of which will be available in 2023. The electric Chevy Equinox will retail for a suggested price of $30,000, which could help drive broader adoption of electric vehicles in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5HB74"&gt;The announcement came during Barra’s keynote address for the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show, at which the company also revealed its electric Chevy Silverado pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="inOp1p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most EVs on the market today are more expensive than their gas equivalents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PBN2BC"&gt;Most EVs on the market today are more expensive than their gas equivalents, though EV sales numbers are still ticking up as more models become available. GM is hoping that a more affordable EV with a nameplate as recognizable as the Equinox could help spur a faster switch to electric. Other EV makers have promised affordable options, only to get tripped up by battery costs, supply chain problems, and other external factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D7xNDf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10962934"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvyoSq"&gt;The arrival of the Equinox EV and Blazer EV would put Chevy at the forefront of GM’s $35 billion push to electrify its entire lineup by 2040. In addition, the company is producing the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV, the Hummer EV pickup and SUV, the GMC Sierra EV, and the Cadillac Lyriq and Celestiq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zqnp70"&gt;Still, GM only shipped a handful of EVs in 2021, placing it far behind Tesla, which commands around two-thirds of the EV market in the US thanks to its relatively affordable Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863751/tesla-delivered-one-million-vehicles-2021"&gt;Tesla shipped nearly 1 million vehicles in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, a new record for the company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cadillac’s autonomous future looks too rich for my blood</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-n1LoZdvIQMuScNeYhKrSkqcx4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350765/Cadillac_Halo_Concept_34_front_night.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3mlhKA"&gt;Cadillac announced a pair of autonomous vehicle concepts that are a definite improvement over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226778/gm-flying-car-cadillac-halo-av-evtol-concept-autonomous-ces-2021"&gt;last year’s toaster-shaped thingamajig&lt;/a&gt;, but also seem designed to appeal to the 1 percent of the 1 percent of the 1 percent. (Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Rich people like cars and robots.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp3BlW"&gt;The Cadillac InnerSpace (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerspace"&gt;shout out, Dennis Quaid&lt;/a&gt;) is a fully autonomous luxury coupe with an electric drivetrain and vibes to spare. The concept will join others in the automaker’s Halo Concept Portfolio, which includes the aforementioned toaster-shaped vehicle and a single-seater electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmxLCN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;shout out Dennis Quaid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iVwLIC"&gt;Here are some more pictures of this slice of deadliness. Also, the roof opens up? I guess that’s pretty cool if you’re a tall person trying to fold yourself into this slab-shaped vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuCoKt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10962723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DR3p1s"&gt;Like any good autonomous concept worth its weight, the InnerSpace lacks traditional controls, like steering wheels and pedals. Instead, Cadillac is opting for an interior space that looks like the bridge of the starship Enterprise, with an imposing curved display that almost completely encompasses the passenger. Nothing says “unsupervised driving” like a screen instead of a windshield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRNj9P"&gt;But while that may seem a little dangerous, Cadillac insists the interior was designed to promote “wellness” among its customers. “Electrification and autonomous driving will fundamentally change the role of vehicles and the experiences customers have with them,” said Bryan Nesbitt, GM’s executive director for Global Advanced Design and Global Architecture Studio, in a statement. “We’re exploring where that will go with these innovative concepts, envisioning mobility as an ally of wellness, giving customers the ultimate luxury, more personal time.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UFLFDd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It would be a mistake to dismiss this as just another concept&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="opvdR1"&gt;It would be a mistake to dismiss this as just another concept with no real chance of becoming a real production car. GM CEO Mary Barra used her keynote speech at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22631496"&gt;announce a plan to sell fully autonomous vehicles to customers starting in the middle of the decade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlwXQ1"&gt;Cadillac is likely to play a large role in that effort as the automaker’s luxury brand. AVs are expensive to produce, with the cost of sensors and computer hardware largely putting many test vehicles in the six-figure range. Who loves six-figure vehicles more than Cadillac customers? I wouldn’t be surprised if the first AV to go on sale will have GM’s luxury nameplate on the front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qiffy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chevy Silverado EV revealed: GM’s best-selling truck goes electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAwI6eIOYIMSgEaEBWKacU0bU9o=/1207x100:6846x3859/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350770/SilveradoEV_RST_OffRoad_1.11.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Up to 400 miles of range and a price that starts at $39,900 for some buyers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3Q9O20"&gt;The Chevy Silverado, one of the top-selling pickup trucks in the US, is going electric. General Motors CEO Mary Barra unveiled Chevy’s answer to the Ford F-150 Lightning during a virtual presentation at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. GM hopes that the plug-in pickup’s familiar nameplate will help it lure Silverado owners and other truck fans to the world of zero tailpipe emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t13PqZ"&gt;The Silverado EV is the second electric truck for GM, succeeding the GMC Hummer EV, which went into production last year. But when it comes out in late 2023, the electric Silverado will be one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536601/gm-ev-investment-increase-amount-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;much larger $35 billion push&lt;/a&gt; into electric vehicles, as well as the first electric truck for the automaker’s Chevy brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1xYQq"&gt;At launch, the Silverado EV will be available in two configurations: an RST First Edition and a fleet-oriented Work Truck (WT) model. Both models will get more than 400 miles of range on a full charge (though that number still needs to be certified by the Environmental Protection Agency). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HvUnzS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RST First Edition will sell for the suggested price of $105,000&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQG6D3"&gt;The base model work truck will start at $39,900, while the fully loaded RST First Edition, named because it will be first off the assembly line in spring 2023, will sell for the suggested price of $105,000. Chevy says that after production ramps up, various versions of the truck will be available for $50,000–$80,000. The automaker is already taking reservations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pD3fFbHVpaEVCY1rdpJvww-ajew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146221/SilveradoEV_RST_OffRoad_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hXPEUz"&gt;Like most electric vehicles, the electric Silverado will be incredibly quick, able to sprint from 0 to 60 mph in less than 4.5 seconds. That’s quicker than the Cybertruck and about on par with the Ford F-150 Lightning. The RST version sounds like it could easily knock the wind out of you, with 485kW of total power (664 horsepower) and 780 pound-feet of torque while in the Silverado’s Wide Open Watts Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxaaDw"&gt;The RST First Edition of the truck will also feature a host of additional features, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wfOF0z"&gt;Four-wheel steering &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WibESG"&gt;Automatic Adaptive Air Suspension, enabling the vehicle to be raised or lowered 2 inches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qTr2aU"&gt;Multi-Flex Midgate that expands the truck’s cargo capability while maintaining seating for a rear row passenger &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T4FH3K"&gt;Available Multi-Flex Tailgate with power release &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="thhfcg"&gt;17-inch LCD infotainment screen paired with a neighboring 11-inch-diagonal reconfigurable driver instrument display and a multi-color driver head-up display with a field of view over 14 inches &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WLggKj"&gt;Trailering-capable Super Cruise, GM’s hands-free driver assistance technology, allowing drivers to travel hands-free on more than 200,000 miles of compatible roads across the US and Canada &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JXRRNhkhRkbz_PnZ_5bm6fK6Tbg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146222/SilveradoEV_WT_Exterior_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3YcUkvyb-DEqQnbEHvv1CVePok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146229/SilveradoEV_RST_Interior_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VLwV08"&gt;That all sounds fun, but all this power is only so good as long as you can easily charge the electric Silverado back up. Charging is still a sore spot for most EVs, and like most non-Tesla automakers, GM doesn’t own its own network, which means that Silverado owners, when they’re not charging at home, will need to rely on a patchwork of third-party EV charging companies for most of their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eOHQS"&gt;Both versions of the truck can take DC fast charging speeds of up to 350kW, which would add an estimated 100 miles for every 10 minutes of charging. Of course, chargers with that kind of power are few and far between, and most owners will likely have to do with 150kW chargers or less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xn76IX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Silverado bests the F-150 Lightning when it comes to onboard power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n70VWs"&gt;The Silverado bests the F-150 Lightning when it comes to onboard power, putting out an incredible 10.2kW for all sorts of charging needs, including powering an entire home or charging another electric vehicle. By contrast, the base trims of the F-150 Lightning can put out 2.4kW of onboard power, and the more expensive Lariat and Platinum trims offer a total of 9.6kW of onboard power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uML3Da"&gt;One of the coolest features is the Multi-Flex Tailgate. On its own, the truck bed is 5 feet 11 inches long, but that can extend to 9 feet when opening the midgate and then to 10 feet 10 inches when extending the Multi-Flex Tailgate. The result is a bunch of different configurations to fit different cargo needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g_Em10BCgb2nKwuDWWg2yY7Hp7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146224/Silverado_EV_RST_Multi_Flex_Midgate___Tailgate_Dimensions.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="41X552"&gt;And yes, there is a frunk. But while Ford had a lot of fun with the branding of its “Mega Power Frunk,” Chevy opted for the more perfunctory “eTrunk,” which sounds more like something a pachyderm would be packing than anything you’d find in your plug-in pickup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RY9vK"&gt;When it eventually hits dealerships, it will find a number of electric trucks already on the market, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;Rivian R1T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and likely the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt;. Most notably, the Silverado’s production will lag behind the F-150 Lightning, which is expected to go into production in spring 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Bn78m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“eTrunk”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9jKm61"&gt;The Silverado EV will be built on GM’s Ultium battery pack and electric drivetrain that is also being used to power the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;Hummer truck and SUV&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226760/gm-cadillac-celestiq-electric-luxury-tease-ces-2021"&gt;Celestiq&lt;/a&gt;, and other upcoming EVs. (The Silverado will use a 24-module Ultium battery pack, similar to the Hummer EV. ) GM has already made some big promises around its Ultium generation of electric vehicles, even while it struggles with its first-generation thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22677539/chevy-bolt-recall-gm-electric-vehicles-fire-tesla-competition"&gt;massive recall of the Bolt EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6pCb37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10962011"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QcYTiz"&gt;It will be built at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;Factory Zero&lt;/a&gt;, GM’s EV plant in Detroit, alongside both Hummer EVs and the Cruise Origin, the automaker’s purpose-built autonomous shuttle. GM is also planning to build two battery factories in the US as it continues to vertically integrate new elements of the manufacturing process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCVVZ4"&gt;Pickup trucks are the biggest sellers in the US. And despite improvements in fuel economy, pickup trucks still consume the most gas and have the most carbon emissions. So, the electrification of the pickup truck market could have a significant impact on the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Gu64V"&gt;Right now, it’s anyone’s game. GM only delivered one Hummer EV truck before the end of 2021. Rivian’s rollout has been slowed by supply chain problems. Ford has high hopes for the F-150 Lighting, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865664/ford-f150-lightning-double-production-150000-annual"&gt;doubling its expected production&lt;/a&gt; to 150,000 by mid-2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="x2IU7a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It will be interesting to see what Ford does with its head start over GM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D4xCDX"&gt;It will be interesting to see what Ford does with its head start over GM, given the intense rivalry between the two companies in the truck space. “They are huge sellers and profit-generators for their parent companies,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, in an email. “Each has an extremely loyal buyer base. Now they come to market with EV versions. Ford may have a leg up since it is coming to market first. We’ll see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzJoGm"&gt;Ford likes to brag that its EVs are not just converting loyal customers to plug-in vehicles but also attracting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;new customers who have never owned a Ford&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now GM’s challenge to do the same with the Silverado EV.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is buying a company for half a billion dollars to boost cloud security</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ykdtHbcTN6vDfc4P9rdxUk97tLw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350666/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LRd2A"&gt;Google’s $500 million acquisition of Israel-based startup &lt;a href="https://www.siemplify.co/"&gt;Siemplify&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to help the company bolster its own cloud security initiative, Chronicle, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/google-beefs-up-internet-security-with-siemplify-buyout-2022-01-04/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/raising-the-bar-in-security-operations"&gt;blog post announcing the deal&lt;/a&gt;, Google describes Siemplify as a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) organization and plans to integrate its capabilities into Chronicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FfTHM2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Siemplify allows Security Operation Center analysts to manage their operations from end-to-end”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5vD8p"&gt;“Siemplify is an intuitive workbench that enables security teams to both manage risk better and reduce the cost of addressing threats,” Sunil Potti, the vice president of Google Cloud Security, states in the blog post. “Siemplify allows Security Operation Center analysts to manage their operations from end-to-end, respond to cyber threats with speed and precision, and get smarter with every analyst interaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulYCvX"&gt;Siemplify got its start in 2015, and as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes, it has raised a total of $58 million from investors to date. A source close to the situation told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the Alphabet-owned Google became interested in purchasing the startup after it heard Siemplify was gearing up for another round of funding. Siemplify will now join Chronicle under the Google Cloud umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoCE0R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16929320/google-x-cybersecurity-chronicle-spin-off-alphabet"&gt;Chronicle was first launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt; after spinning off of X Development (formerly Google X), Alphabet’s “moonshot factory,” and is supposed to help large enterprises detect, analyze, and store security-related information. According to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kej3e/chronicle-is-dead-and-google-killed-it"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, security experts were excited about the up-and-coming company when it first launched, as it was supposed to use innovative machine-learning technology and telemetry data to boost companies’ cybersecurity. But after &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/the-security-moonshot-joins-google-cloud"&gt;becoming an arm of Google Cloud in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reports that some employees quit — including co-founder Mike Wiacek — as a result of feeling that the company lost its original purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIdPwf"&gt;Google’s acquisition of Siemplify doesn’t come long after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642054/apple-amazon-google-microsoft-cybersecurity-billions"&gt;tech giant promised to spend over $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years to help improve US cybersecurity. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;President Joe Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to help strengthen national cybersecurity in light of the major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;attacks on the Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s CES 2022 showcase includes a metaverse experience we didn’t ask for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wEn0h3dHO4-N3iSpbddkcyTiQg4=/598x0:2286x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70350643/IMG_1212.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get ice cream, talk to other booth goers, and barely interact with anything in Samsung’s “My House” CES experience.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NTFcY0"&gt;On the first day of CES 2022, Samsung opened up the virtual doors to its My House metaverse experience. The company built a customizable digital home accessible through the Zepeto app — a metaverse platform. With the number of COVID-19 infections reaching new highs, many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;pulled out&lt;/a&gt; or downsized their physical presence for CES this year — making virtual options like livestreaming a booth from a phone or, in this case, a metaverse booth, alternative ways to share products.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Don’t get too excited...&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="heea9N"&gt;The problem is, no one asked Samsung for &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; metaverse experience. Especially not the target audience the company’s press release stated this is for — millennials and zoomers. Just take a look at the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/ces-2022-samsung-x-zepeto-interacting-with-innovative-home-appliances-in-the-metaverse"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; trying to sell the idea; I’m imagining this pitch from an employee word for word in a Zoom call to Samsung executives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QFkumU"&gt;You’ve likely heard of the metaverse before. It’s no longer a fad, but a well-established trend of the future. With online communication continuously evolving, the metaverse has created new industrial, social and cultural values. Millennials and ‘zoomers’ (members of Gen Z) are using this digital space to project identities that are different from reality, and have created a new world of experiences through active interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This customized living room has two of Samsung’s Bespoke Jet vacuum cleaners — any less and this place would be a mess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p8edIX"&gt;Samsung began this metaverse partnership with Zepeto developer Naver Z back in August of last year with the platformer game-like Galaxy House experience that features members of BTS. But the CES version opts for more of a &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; experience: players can walk around a fenced yard and enter a customizable home packed with Samsung products like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds"&gt;Freestyle projector&lt;/a&gt;, Bespoke vacuum cleaner, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen"&gt;The Frame TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i3oUVN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10962543"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qn96oz"&gt;You start off in the front yard of the house, where you can interact with other people and also visit different homes. Different walls, decor, and finishes are available, but the actual layout of the home remains the same for everyone. You enter the front door into the living room, turn right into the kitchen that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;colorful Bespoke appliances&lt;/a&gt;, then take another right to what seems to be an open-concept laundry room, and finally move down the hall with the office, bedroom, and bathroom. There’s also a whole front and backyard, but you can’t do anything other than sit down in a few places and sit on top of a treehouse (which you annoyingly can’t even enter).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feeling the breeze from what looks like a Samsung tower fan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gba32U"&gt;I fully expected this experience to have a lot of product information — like an actual CES booth — but the makers of this Samsung’s experience apparently wanted the products to remain low-key and focus on how Instagram-ready your imaginary home can look. You can pick up the Bespoke Jet vacuum and run around with it, stand in front of an air purifier and enjoy the breeze, and play video games on the unknown model TV in the living room or on a curved Samsung monitor in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The animations are silly loops: your avatar will just randomly type on the keyboard while a looping video of a racing game displays on the unknown Samsung curved monitor. It’s certainly not like the new enormous &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ark monitor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;I like to listen to music while vacuuming the Kitchen but I didn’t find any Bixby powered &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21136224/samsung-galaxy-home-bixby-not-released" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galaxy Home speaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p id="tuh6Pr"&gt;I do wish Samsung made its CES experience on Zepeto more like the previous &lt;a href="https://zefro.zepeto.me/nds/event/wP7mO3wK87DsFLca2TtXfbN?lang=en"&gt;Galaxy House experience&lt;/a&gt; from August. That felt more like a product showcase and more CES-like than this My House experience. I visited the old experience as well — where I am challenged to do some &lt;em&gt;Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;-style platform jumping to the top of a Space-themed world so I can take a selfie with Jin from BTS. It was much more engaging than walking into a bathroom in the My House experience — where you can brush your teeth but not do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F5f71p0wET9C4xv-YON4GJRsMzw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146943/IMG_1177.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy House Zepeto experience from August was much more fun. I got a selfie with Jin and climbed Super Mario-like moving platforms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy House bottom floor which has products you can buy in a metaverse — that’s what Samsung should have done for its CES experience as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
