    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Mmxwi"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7Xehh"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter start the show with &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;senior reporter Adi Robertson and managing editor Alex Cranz to discuss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22713276/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-launch-price-hands-on"&gt;HTC’s new VR headset, the Vive Flow&lt;/a&gt;. Adi was able to try out the $499 entertainment-focused headset and shares experience and first impressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elK43M"&gt;Second half of the show, we turn it back to event season. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721480/samsung-galaxy-foldables-testing-z-flip-3-screens-cracking"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have all scheduled product release events for next week. The crew discusses what to expect from each of the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="acDw5X"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/79fyo4BEs6xK9Y6MFvC0fK" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="abLtt5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVMNm7"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like Dieter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;review of the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The M1 Mac Mini has dropped to its lowest price ever at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mac mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZAGWErUNXF4knmlC1dV_BphLsvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69998755/cwelch_201114_4292_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s $150 discount on the 512GB Mac Mini brings the 2020 desktop down to its lowest price to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IEMiEQ"&gt;The Mac Mini is already Apple’s most affordable desktop computer, which makes today’s discount an even better deal. Right now, you can grab the 2020 Mac Mini with 512GB of storage and 8GB of RAM for its lowest price to date. Typically $899, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is currently taking $150 off&lt;/a&gt; in total and bringing the price down to $750, a discount you’ll see at checkout. Note, however, that the 256GB version is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also on sale for $600&lt;/a&gt; instead of its typical $700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7Kx1v"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we dubbed Apple’s M1-equipped Mac Mini an “overperformer,” praising how it outperforms other Intel-based Macs. While it has the same, blazing-fast M1 chip as last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, we noted it’s technically the better performer thanks to its efficiently cooled chassis. The Mini also offers Wi-Fi 6, and many existing apps run well at this point on Apple’s new silicon despite having been originally built for Intel chips. There are fewer USB-C ports than on the previous models, however, and there’s no support for external GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i8jj0Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="4ZtdeG"&gt;The excellent 4K TV offers support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, a 120Hz refresh rate, a fast processor, and low input lag. Gamers will also enjoy the OLED’s support for HDMI 2.1, which allows 4K at up to 120 frames per second, and the “Game Optimizer” settings pane, making it easy to quickly access gamer-centric settings like refresh rate. Other notable features include built-in support for Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, as well as support for AirPlay 2, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X1bAQw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x6jt3W"&gt;If the $399 starting price of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; is too steep for you, don’t worry: you can pick up the well-reviewed Apple Watch SE for over $150 less. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the Apple Watch SE with GPS for $240&lt;/a&gt; instead of $270, an all-time low you’ll see at checkout. The deal only applies to the 40mm silver version, however, which comes with an abyss blue sports band. Although the watch is not currently in stock, you can still purchase it at the discounted price, and Amazon will ship it to you when it becomes available. Currently, that expected shipping window is early November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1R8JUf"&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found the watch was similar to the Series 4 in design, performance, and capabilities. It can’t, however, monitor your heart with an EKG and doesn’t have an always-on display like the Series 5, 6, or 7. However, if all you need is a basic smartwatch that tracks your fitness levels, provides notifications at a glance, and allows you to make payments, then the SE is an excellent option and a considerable step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnlk2Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ50MW"&gt;The Amazon Echo Show 8, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;best smart displays&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now, is selling at a record low for only the third time since its debut. Although it launched earlier this year for $130, you can now buy the second-gen Show 8 for $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DC4LW6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750688708099700197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, a 23 percent discount. Moreover, Amazon is also offering an additional 25 percent off when you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDctzD"&gt;Like its predecessor, you can still use the Show 8 to watch content from services like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu. It also allows you to control other smart home devices, listen to your music, and get weather reports. The smart display is faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, too, and offers a 13MP camera with improved image quality that you can use for video calls. The camera will even make sure you’re constantly in the frame as you’re moving, though it’s not as effective as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; feature.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g9zOKU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sbYxBn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Monica Chin has highly recommended&lt;/a&gt; the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 as the Chromebook to buy, and for good reason: it’s an affordable model that outperforms many others in terms of features, build quality, and performance. And right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling&lt;/a&gt; the previous-gen model with 4GB of RAM, a 64GB SSD, and an Intel 10th Gen Core i3 processor for $329 instead of $529. While this 2020 model lacks Intel’s 11th Gen processors and support for Thunderbolt 4, it should still be suitable for basic, everyday tasks. We even found them to showcase slightly better battery life than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtfRrU"&gt;If you really want the newer device that has Thunderbolt 4, you can grab the model with 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Evo-certified 11th Gen Intel Core i5 for a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted price of $619 (normally $699)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RjmJkq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GP9xyM"&gt;One of the best soundbars you can buy if your streaming device or TV offers support for Dolby Atmos is $180 cheaper today when you buy it refurbished. Typically $899, Sonos is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-14575253?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Farc-b-stock" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished Sonos Arc in white for just $719&lt;/a&gt;, a deal we typically only see a few times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOfiKy"&gt;Performance-wise, the Arc delivers powerful, immersive sound. After pairing it with the Sonos Sub in a room with a 5.1.2 Atmos surround system and speakers in the ceiling, we found the soundbar delivered as immersive a sound as our multiple-speaker Atmos system. However, to get the best possible surround sound, keep in mind that you’ll need a more recent TV. That’s because the device only offers a single HDMI ARC port through which older models often can’t pass Atmos out. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qdt9oc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10672350"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s new emoji isn’t as 3D as Microsoft promised</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50P9owM69dQns7gKP5HLaBVPc4g=/79x0:1081x668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69998323/Emoji_Panel_New_Emoji_Hero.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rwVfu3"&gt;Microsoft originally promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578352/microsoft-new-3d-emoji-clippy-windows-office"&gt;new 3D emoji for Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; and various other products earlier this year. Now the company has gone for a 2D flat look instead, with the new emoji debuting in Dev Channel builds of Windows 11 this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7fTae"&gt;The style is a lot different to the 3D emoji that Microsoft promised in July, and even in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsUK/status/1446434458178146309"&gt;recent tweets&lt;/a&gt; from the official Windows Twitter accounts. Microsoft appears to have changed its mind on going 3D inside Windows 11. “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brandonleblanc/status/1448700437889097767"&gt;For Windows 11 we’re using the 2D versions&lt;/a&gt;,” says Brandon LeBlanc, a senior program manager on the Windows Insider team. LeBlanc also says Microsoft “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brandonleblanc/status/1448806388847710212?s=21"&gt;used the wrong graphics&lt;/a&gt;” in recent tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_uBgYKN7Ph3zXyASX2LtJ4Nv7CQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928947/GcHxn3A.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s emoji was supposed to be more 3D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5EHxkh"&gt;It’s not clear why Microsoft hasn’t adopted its 3D designs in Windows 11, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578352/microsoft-new-3d-emoji-clippy-windows-office"&gt;despite promises to do so&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s likely because a flatter 2D design works better across multiple applications. 3D designs also look different across a variety of screens and resolutions, so Microsoft has likely settled on a 2D design for a more consistent representation of its emoji for all Windows 11 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tC7jXa"&gt;We’re still expecting to see the 3D style appear elsewhere in Microsoft products though, particularly in Microsoft Teams where animated emoji exists. The new emoji in Windows 11 also includes the return of Clippy, as Microsoft has removed the standard paperclip emoji with its Clippy character. &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22478/"&gt;Microsoft is testing this emoji&lt;/a&gt; in recent Dev Channel builds of Windows 11, but it’s expected to rollout to all users soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this investigation into Amazon’s sprawling empire of in-house brands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d13y36dihDEFKrfkabpeC5m-OiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69998280/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCIHF2"&gt;It’s no secret that Amazon owns a wealth of in-house brands that sell everything from affordable tech accessories (Amazon Basics) to e-readers (Kindle). But a &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;new investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on just how big this empire has gotten, and makes some troubling allegations about the advantages these brands seem to have over third-party competitors selling on Amazon. It’s a fascinating report that’s &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;well worth a read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGR5Dn"&gt;For starters, just working out how many brands Amazon owns is a process that required &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; to analyse public records from the US Patent and Trademark office. According to its reporting, the ecommerce giant has registered or owns over 150 brands, including some where their connection to Amazon isn’t obvious. But more worrying is that some of these brands, as well as others that sell exclusively on Amazon, seem to have no trouble outranking the competition in search results without getting as many positive reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XLj1KD"&gt;“The Markup found Amazon placed its Happy Belly Cinnamon Crunch cereal, with four stars and 1,010 reviews, in the number one spot ahead of cereals with better and more reviews including Cap’n Crunch (five stars, 14,069 reviews), Honey Bunches of Oats (five stars, 5,205 reviews), and Honey Nut Cheerios (five stars, 11,702 reviews). A vacuum cleaner from Amazon’s exclusive Noisz brand was placed on top, ahead of models from Bissell, Eureka, and Hoover with higher ratings and more reviews. And the Amazon-exclusive Concept 3sneaker from Skechers placed number one, four spots ahead of a similar but not exclusive to Amazon Skechers sneaker with the same star rating but 77 times more reviews.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2ITKJO"&gt;One former Amazon employee interviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; alleged that the company’s employees have, in the past, used a tactic called “search seeding” to give its own products an advantage over the competition. Although the former employee, JT Meng, said that the practice had stopped by the time he left the company, he said that employees could effectively clone a competitor’s search ranking to give Amazon’s products a boost at launch: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="d6e0WY"&gt;“Meng worked on the launch for Amazon Elements baby wipes, which he said were seeded against similar products from Huggies, Pampers, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fPVyA"&gt;Sales spiked so quickly that his team had to stop promoting the Amazon Elements wipes so they didn’t take too much market share, he said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vikNZs"&gt;This isn’t the first time we’ve seen allegations about how Amazon’s own brands compete with third-party sellers on its platform (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting from April&lt;/a&gt; is a good example). But &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;’s analysis is notable for the sheer breadth of products analysed, not to mention the empirical data it’s gathered about Amazon’s rankings. The &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read alongside the other articles produced as part of its &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/series/amazons-advantage"&gt;package on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Govee’s inexpensive TV backlight goes big</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A strong bias for bias lighting&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="l0mVD9"&gt;Smart lighting upstart Govee has added Light Bars to its newest &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-immersion-kit-wi-fi-tv-backlight-light-bars"&gt;Immersion TV LED Kit (model H605B)&lt;/a&gt; to harmoniously extend the backlight to the left and right of 55- to 65-inch TVs. The additions nearly double the illuminated area — and the price. The jump from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=4ebe3c58-acb4-bc36-9e2&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22330449%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B7PY111?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99&lt;/a&gt; makes the new Immersion Kit a more considered purchase. But if you liked the older Immersion TV LED kit (model H6199) as much as I did, then you’re going to love the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xbB4ba"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10806842"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vdyIcd"&gt;I should first confess to my bias for responsive bias lighting. As I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review"&gt;review of the previous Govee model&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve long been a fan of the Ambilight tech used on some Philips televisions, the ones that make it seem like the display is bleeding onto the wall in perfect 360-degree synchronization. It makes playing video games and watching things like sports and anime feel more immersive. But that’s me, there are plenty of people who find the whole concept ridiculous and distracting. If that’s you, read no further. Otherwise, continue on my people because this new Govee Immersion Kit is a visual treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div id="6qT0YV"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Govee fluid calm segmented color|104351" data-volume-uuid="c43e68771" data-volume-id="104351" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-359" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Govee Immersion Kit and Light Bars reacting to the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/qC0vDKVPCrw" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fluid Sim Hue Test video on YouTube&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Bar Segment color / Calm modes).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kemngx"&gt;Steps to install the color-sensing camera and 12-foot adhesive LED light strip are the same as the previous kit, so I won’t repeat them here. (Govee provides a nice &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyg4BGlTvmE"&gt;video tutorial&lt;/a&gt;). I will say that attaching the orange foam stickers (with &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; light pressure) to the television display for the purpose of calibrating the camera doesn’t feel any less icky the second time around. Nevertheless, my expensive 55-inch OLED remains unharmed, and the installation of the LED strip onto the back of my TV was much faster this time around. In fact, it took less than 30 minutes to install the entire kit since I now know what I’m doing. First timers should set aside about an hour, just like with the previous Govee kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9OaUA"&gt;The Light Bars attach to the Govee control box via a single USB-C Y-cable. You define which bar is left and which is right in the Govee app during calibration. Govee recommends that the Light Bars are positioned about 20 inches (51cm) from the sides of the TV. They should also be at the same depth as the LED strip on the back of the TV panel to ensure a consistent backlight intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NjmXfD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Everything has been tweaked or improved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lz9nqo"&gt;Although the components look similar to the older Immersion Kit, Govee tells me that everything has been tweaked or improved. That includes new camera software algorithms that properly transmit color information to the backlight and Light Bars simultaneously. In other words, owners of the old kit that are upgrading can’t mix and match, so all that 3M tape will need to be removed before installing the new kit. In my own experience, the tape holding the camera and 12-foot LED strip to the TV released without leaving any sticky residue and without causing any damage to the TV — no hair dryer needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBibsm"&gt;Once installed, the Immersion lighting is configured in the Govee Home app over Bluetooth. There’s also Wi-Fi for including the backlighting into your smart home, with baked-in support for both Alexa and Google Assistant. I have little use for the voice commands since I plugged the Immersion Kit’s control box into a smart plug that automatically turns the backlighting on and off along with the TV (it remembers your last used Govee settings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmscI8"&gt;The Govee Home app introduces an overwhelming set of options for the Immersion Kit. There are interactive party modes that make the lights respond to music and static modes built around your preferred color patterns and scenes. But video mode is where the Ambilight-like magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div id="78c8Gw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10806765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vKrthX"&gt;Video mode can be set to either Dynamic (previously known as Game) or Calm (previously Movie). Dynamic causes the colors to change more abruptly, while Calm results in smoother but slower color transitions. Both settings suffer from a slight lag compared to a true Philips Ambilight TV (or even the Philips Hue Play Box), but it’s acceptable, especially when the backlights are dimmed for a more subtle effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nm4S9UspjM-ZKz600G9NE7a_Rtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926025/IMG_0407.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Govee Home app is highly configurable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mGaOr0"&gt;There are four modes of color synchronization. The Bar Segment mode is my preference as it allows the Light Bar to mimic the variations in color projected by the left and right segments of the RGBIC LED light strip attached to the back of the TV. The Same Color mode is my next preference, for when I want to project a single, less distracting color onto the wall that best matches the current TV scene. The two other modes I never used: I can’t see why anyone would want to use Different Color mode, while the Whole Bar mode was very similar to Bar Segment in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="im9b31"&gt;After a few weeks of testing, my default viewing mode is Calm / Bar Segment, and 50 percent brightness and saturation. But that’s me; I urge you to experiment and live with each setting for a few days in a variety of scenarios to see what works best for you. There’s a fine line between immersion and distraction, and the Govee Immersion Kit is flexible enough to help you find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I66Lsu"&gt;I also mounted the camera below my TV panel as before. Yes, it causes the color accuracy to suffer a bit from light interference during the day, but that’s the tradeoff for not having to look at that ugly camera (it’s now conveniently hidden by my soundbar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZfSCU"&gt;The Light Bars and stands are made of cheap black plastic — something you notice when handling them, not when looking at them from across the room. Unfortunately, there’s no option for white which would be easier to camouflage in my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gPx3Xm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10806857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Zcvb4"&gt;Those nitpicks notwithstanding, I love the expansive backlighting effect in my own living room and prefer it over the older Govee model. It did require some time to get used to, but that might have been me gee-whizzing over the tech. Now it just makes everything on the TV seem BIG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43muqu"&gt;I’m fortunate that my TV also sits on a long low cabinet which allows me to easily install everything. Owners of wall-mounted TVs without nearby shelving for the Light Bars might be out of luck. You could rig a mount yourself (the included Light Bars have mounting points on the back, weirdly) but then you’ll have to contend with two black wires snaking back to your TV. Good luck with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loVHzW"&gt;All that said, I don’t think the addition of Light Bars justifies a near doubling of the price over Govee’s previous Immersion Kit. But even at &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/govee-immersion-kit-wi-fi-tv-backlight-light-bars"&gt;$149.99&lt;/a&gt;, it remains significantly less expensive than the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$229 Philips Hue Play Box&lt;/a&gt; which requires you to purchase lights separately, like the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-light-bar-double-pack/7820230U7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99 Hue Play Bar two-pack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-play-gradient-lightstrip-55-inch/046677560409" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$229.99 Play Gradient light strip&lt;/a&gt; (and possibly a $59.99 Hue Bridge if you don’t already have one). Govee’s Immersion Kit also works with anything displayed on the TV, whereas the Play Box only works with content fed to it via HDMI. The Play Box, however, doesn’t suffer from any lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XY4CAr"&gt;Govee’s products tend to go on sale quite often. In fact, the older $79.99 Immersion Kit is on sale right now for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=4ebe3c58-acb4-bc36-9e2&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22330449%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$67.99 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights"&gt;$58.80 direct from Govee&lt;/a&gt;, making it a steal, in my opinion. But if you want to take your responsive backlighting to the extreme and can’t wait for Black Friday, you likely won’t be disappointed even at the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s Metroid Dread has a bug: here’s how to avoid it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="metroid dread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7SUMxy5J4W8gZ0vwNgYEd54PUU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69998140/Switch_MetroidDread_screen_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dread is the first all-new 2D Metroid in almost 20 years.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Metroid Dread&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BnzV3e"&gt;Nintendo is working to fix a bug in recently-released &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; that could halt your progression if you’re unlucky enough to encounter it, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1448816874423308288"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/p/989/a_id/56652"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; the bug causes the error message “The software was closed because an error occurred,” forcing it to close unexpectedly. Nintendo says the patch will be released before the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajQTxC"&gt;Until this patch is released, however, players will need to avoid triggering the bug, which can apparently occur near the end of the game if the player “destroys a door while a map marker for that specific door is displayed on the map.” Thankfully, that means recovering from the crash when it occurs is fairly simple. Here’s what Nintendo says you should do if your game crashes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EfnWvb"&gt;“Restart the game and, before playing through this sequence, remove the door icon map marker to prevent this error from occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PHuuZj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; was released last week on October 8th, and represents the first all-new 2D Metroid game in almost two decades (not including remakes like &lt;em&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns&lt;/em&gt;). It’s been broadly positively received, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Andrew Webster&lt;/a&gt; notes that the game’s controls can struggle to keep up with its more hectic action sequences, of which there are far too many.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse has a new Music Mode that could make it the place to play</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Surveillance Fears After Clubhouse App Takes Saudi By Storm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnNetxPxfp1nMIl_ZOMId1NETDM=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69997400/1231631262.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i9zjy8"&gt;Clubhouse has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;a tremendous amount of competition&lt;/a&gt; from big companies that want to own the live audio space, but it may be getting out ahead in one specific way. The company’s launching a new Music Mode that could make it a better place to play — and listen — to live music, ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/amazon-live-audio-clubhouse-competitor-ea0ead59-f6d3-49a0-a216-a4105e0338ba.html"&gt;Amazon’s reported entry&lt;/a&gt; into that space, and as Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;has begun rolling out “ticketed spaces”&lt;/a&gt; where musicians could host shows as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535214/spotify-greenroom-locker-room-live-audio-app"&gt;Spotify has its own live audio app, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBmBa8"&gt;If you’re a musician on Clubhouse, or you love listening to live music on the app, the new Music Mode “optimizes Clubhouse to broadcast your music with high quality and great stereo sound,” according to &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/music-mode-hallway-search/"&gt;the company’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Clubhouse doesn’t say what it means by high quality, but it does also mention that you can now hook up professional equipment, like a USB mic or mixing board, and use it during your broadcast. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648050/clubhouse-spatial-audio-3d-360-sound"&gt;Clubhouse already added spatial audio in late August&lt;/a&gt;, which makes conversations sound more like a room full of people than a flat audio call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Clubhouse Music Mode" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y-9FrQbbygiI7K2bVwOlHoxRgK8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927960/clubhouse_music_mode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Clubhouse&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8LLiV"&gt;You can easily turn on Music Mode by tapping the three dots in the top right corner of a room, selecting Audio Quality, and then choosing Music. If you just want to listen to the performance, however, you won’t have to do any of this — just sit back and enjoy stereo audio from your headphones, speakers, or your phone itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RLSae"&gt;Clubhouse also noted that its recently introduced Clips feature — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702034/clubhouse-recording-in-app-clip-tool-update"&gt;which lets you capture a 30-second recording&lt;/a&gt; — will support stereo sound as well, so if you decide to save a snippet of a performance in Music Mode, the audio quality will stay the same. Music Mode will initially only be available on iOS, but Clubhouse says that the rollout to Android will follow shortly behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5g6c8V"&gt;Aside from Music Mode, Clubhouse has also updated its search feature. The platform will now display the search bar in a more convenient location at the top of your hallway. And as an added plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690029/clubhouse-wave-invites-audio-chats"&gt;you’ll also be able to Wave to friends&lt;/a&gt; right from the search bar, a feature that lets you quickly invite friends to a live audio room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q6xYJ"&gt;Amazon is far from Clubhouse’s only competition for live audio. Clubhouse likely learned its lesson this past year, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and even Spotify made their own versions of audio-only chatrooms&lt;/a&gt;. All of this came at a time when Clubhouse was still in an invite-only state, making it harder for the app to grow. But now that the app is thriving, Clubhouse wants keep as many advantages as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook execs tease VR prototype hardware with new photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v7-l0N8nmrT1PU6wpZZFsnAuqqc=/0x178:843x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990835/245329931_10113982963136581_574941966054337503_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9WeKB"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook virtual reality lead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;soon-to-be CTO&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Bosworth (or “Boz”) are playing around with prototype VR (or AR) tech and want to show it off. Both executives have &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10113982963161531&amp;amp;set=a.529237706231"&gt;posted pictures of themselves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448336606360838145?s=21"&gt;wearing prototype headsets&lt;/a&gt; and linking the concepts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Facebook’s work&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;. While the headsets the two are wearing are in no way guaranteed to become actual retail products, it’s an interesting look at what’s going on in Facebook’s virtual reality lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QybSMc"&gt;The headset Zuckerberg is wearing looks similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;the company’s Oculus headsets&lt;/a&gt;. However, he identifies it as “retina resolution,” borrowing Apple’s phrase for screens with such high pixel density that you can’t discern individual points at a normal operating distance. The headsets Boz shows off have more intriguing designs — one looks, to be frank, almost exactly like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;drawings and descriptions of Apple’s rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. The other one looks like it either has a very large strap or a cap that holds it onto his head, along with a wire sticking out of the contraption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m2P08e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Proud of the research Michael Abrash's team is working on at FRL-R Redmond—excited to get an early look at some of the technologies that will underpin the metaverse (we work on several prototype headsets to prove out concepts, this is one of them. Kind of. It's a long story.) &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yi9xjy5HmG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yi9xjy5HmG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448336606360838145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="LSUhWN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So. Many. Prototypes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xGESgGm7pH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xGESgGm7pH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448401190379606021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKlzXd"&gt;Beyond Zuckerberg’s vague “retina” comment, there are basically no details on what kind of headsets they are, what they’re capable of, or even if they’re just nonfunctional design mock-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bxxMxp"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed" style="max-width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10113982963161531&amp;amp;set=a.529237706231" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto%2F%3Ffbid%3D10113982963161531%26set%3Da.529237706231&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ihcOXc"&gt;That’s perhaps to be expected, given that this isn’t a product announcement from Facebook. While the company has released a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;smart (and screen-less) Ray Bans&lt;/a&gt;, which it called a step in the path “towards full augmented reality glasses,” Facebook’s virtual reality lab also teases many prototypes that probably won’t make it to market. That includes things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609564/facebook-reality-lab-reverse-passthrough-vr-prototype-research-siggraph"&gt;horrifying eye-projection headset&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641894/facebook-project-aria-augmented-reality-ar-research-glasses-user-manual"&gt;research-focused Aria AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308813/facebook-vr-sunglasses-research-proof-of-concept"&gt;proof-of-concept set of VR glasses&lt;/a&gt; (which show you a virtual world instead of augmenting the real one). Rather than hawking headsets, Boz and Zuckerberg seem to be selling their metaverse concept, which the company says is a virtual world that could be the next version of the internet. If you want to do a deep-dive into what that means exactly, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;my colleagues’ great explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Boz declined the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CNIGbx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;no deal&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448366889126686720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple rehires former HomePod engineer to get its software back on track</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/erYLoVBkWHmT94b0ghPPceTy_wc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69997107/jbareham_180202_2266_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sheL58"&gt;Apple has hired a former HomePod engineer, Afrooz Family, to head up the team developing HomePod software, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/apple-hires-new-homepod-software-head-as-it-takes-on-amazon-echo?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which could signal a renewed effort from Apple to make the HomePod more competitive. The company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679870/new-apple-homekit-features-homepod-mini"&gt;HomePod software version 15&lt;/a&gt; in September, bringing some welcome features like the ability to use one or a pair of HomePod Mini speakers as the default with an Apple TV 4K. But Apple’s smart speaker line faces stiff competition, particularly from Amazon’s and Google’s speakers that are equipped with their smart assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPl4RF"&gt;Family left Apple in 2016, where he was a senior audio engineer, to co-found audio company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsyngspace.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22727249%2Fapple-homepod-software-chief-afrooz-family" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Syng&lt;/a&gt; with ex-Apple designer Christopher Stringer. (A &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; article about Syng described Family as the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4a88a13-47c3-4bb4-a627-704fdf0c392b"&gt;“secret weapon.”&lt;/a&gt;) Syng’s claim to fame is its Cell Alpha connected speaker, which offers spatial audio in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439925/syng-cell-alpha-wi-fi-speaker-apple-designer-death-star-triphonic"&gt;Death Star-like design&lt;/a&gt;, but it comes with a steep $1,799 price tag. Family left Syng earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWEIYP"&gt;The first HomePod, which was released in 2018, was lauded for its sound quality but was criticized for its high price, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;Apple discontinued it in March&lt;/a&gt;. The company released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;cheaper and smaller HomePod Mini last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJsjrv"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Block Party is out of beta and ready to block anyone who likes bad tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ff7pgamXDpEKOIu-KlZIKMuUBjs=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69997092/blockpartyleadimage.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Block Party&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVBZ7i"&gt;Block Party, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/"&gt;the anti-harassment service&lt;/a&gt; that specializes in making Twitter more tolerable to use, &lt;a href="https://blog.blockpartyapp.com/p/introducing-blocklists-paidplans"&gt;is out of beta and available now&lt;/a&gt;. Block Party automates the time-consuming process of moderating your Twitter feed, filtering out content from people you don’t want to see for later review and, starting today, blocking accounts that retweet or like a bad tweet of your choice with blocklists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNQaOd"&gt;Block Party’s services are available in three different tiers. Free Basic accounts can use Block Party’s moderate filters to catch @mentions and place them in a “Lockout Folder” for later review. Premium accounts, which start at $12 per month, include stricter filters, block lists, a helper view to allow friends or family to review troubling tweets, bulk actions to block or mute multiple accounts in your Lockout Folder at once, and watchlists for tracking accounts after you mute them. The $13 per month Supporter tier includes all of those features and the opportunity to try new features before they’re released.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfQIx19am9e3hjO1kDI_G9Bl6ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22927904/ezgif.com_gif_maker__2_.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EsT7JY"&gt;Block Party offers a lot, but the two core ideas — filters and block lists — could make a big difference for anyone who has to use Twitter for their job or has a high-profile account that’s already a target of harassment. The company &lt;a href="https://blog.blockpartyapp.com/p/blocklists-design"&gt;has also tried to be mindful&lt;/a&gt; about how it implements both features. Block lists are capped at 100 accounts per list (you can have unlimited lists) in the hopes that it's a small enough amount you can review the list for anyone you might still want to see on your timeline. Meanwhile, filters can be set to remove spam accounts (new accounts without a profile photo, for example) or tuned even tighter to only show @mentions from people you follow or have replied to recently. Twitter offers both features in some capacity, but it lacks the flexibility, focusing on blocking and muting specific words or accounts, without all of the automation or customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPjlv7"&gt;Twitter’s made moves to offer more moderation and privacy tools, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721218/twitter-soft-block-remove-follower-web"&gt;the built-in soft block tool&lt;/a&gt; released just this week or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654061/twitter-features-archive-old-tweets-hide-likes-remove-followers-plans"&gt;concepts for ways to hide old tweets&lt;/a&gt; or limit who can see what you’ve liked. So far, though, Block Party has a head start and should make it much easier to make a difference in the quality of your timeline with just a few steps.&lt;/p&gt;
