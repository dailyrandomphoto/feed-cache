    <title>Here’s how to check your phone for Pegasus spyware using Amnesty’s tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_wLLHhmJC-VeJv8XDk3AKGKcU3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614139/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UqlvLv"&gt;Amnesty International — part of the group that helped break the news of journalists and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/"&gt;heads of state&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;targeted by NSO’s government-grade spyware, Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; — has &lt;a href="https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt"&gt;released a tool&lt;/a&gt; to check if your phone has been affected. Alongside the tool is &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;a great set of instructions&lt;/a&gt;, which should help you through the somewhat technical checking process. Using the tool involves backing up your phone to a separate computer and running a check on that backup. Read on if you’ve been side-eyeing your phone since the news broke and are looking for guidance on using Amnesty’s tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5SXJL"&gt;The first thing to note is the tool is command line or terminal based, so it will take either some amount of technical skill or a bit of patience to run. We try to cover a lot of what you need to know to get up and running here, but it’s something to know before jumping in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ywv2yX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It will take some amount of technical skill or a bit of patience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBreVE"&gt;The second note is that the analysis Amnesty is running seems to work best for iOS devices. In its documentation, Amnesty says the analysis its tool can run on Android phone backups is limited, but the tool can still &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/backup.html"&gt;check for potentially malicious&lt;/a&gt; SMS messages &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/download_apks.html"&gt;and APKs&lt;/a&gt;. Again, we recommend &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/methodology.html"&gt;following its instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmhupe"&gt;To check your iPhone, the easiest way to start is by making &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220"&gt;an encrypted backup&lt;/a&gt; either &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977"&gt;using iTunes or Finder&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac or PC. You’ll then need to locate that backup, which &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215"&gt;Apple provides instructions&lt;/a&gt; for. Linux users can follow &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/backup/libimobiledevice.html"&gt;Amnesty’s instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to use the libimobiledevice command line tool to create a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxUBio"&gt;After getting a backup of your phone, you’ll then need to download and install Amnesty’s mvt program, which Amnesty &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html"&gt;also provides instructions&lt;/a&gt; for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iEJPR"&gt;If you’re using a Mac to run the check, you’ll first need to install both Xcode, which can be downloaded from the App Store, and Python3 before you can install and run mvt. The easiest way to obtain Python3 is using a &lt;a href="https://brew.sh"&gt;program called Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, which can be installed and run from the Terminal. After installing these, you’ll be ready to run through &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/methodology.html"&gt;Amnesty’s iOS instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IVCsFf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll want to make sure your iPhone’s backup is encrypted with a password&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWO0z4"&gt;If you run into issues while trying to decrypt your backup, you’re not alone. The tool was giving me errors when I tried to point it to my backup, which was in the default folder. To solve this, I copied the backup folder from that default location into a folder on my desktop and pointed mvt to it. My command ended up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o83CmZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(For illustration purposes only. Please use commands from Amnesty’s instructions, as it’s possible the program has been updated.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5tlTpa"&gt;mvt-ios decrypt-backup -p PASSWORD -d decrypt ~/Desktop/bkp/orig &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="caHwTS"&gt;When running the actual scan, you’ll want to point to an Indicators of Compromise file, which &lt;a href="https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2021-07-18_nso"&gt;Amnesty provides&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a file called pegasus.stix2. Those who are brand-new to using the terminal may get tripped up on how to actually point to a file, but it’s relatively simple as long as you know where the file is. For beginners, I’d recommend downloading the stix2 file to your Mac’s Downloads folder. Then, when you get to the step where you’re actually running the check-backup command, add &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WKtKXZ"&gt;-i ~/Downloads/pegasus.stix2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N4wKqT"&gt;into the option section. For reference, my command ended up looking like this. (Again, this is for illustration purposes only. Trying to copy these commands and run them will result in an error):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CzbLbd"&gt;mvt-ios check-backup -o logs --iocs ~/Downloads/pegasus.stix2 ~/Desktop/bkp/decrypt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kd2wwX"&gt;(For reference, the ~/ is more or less acting as a shortcut to your user folder, so you don’t have to add in something like /Users/mitchell.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8sBH8"&gt;Again, I’d recommend following along with Amnesty’s instructions and using its commands, as it’s always possible that the tool will have been updated. Security researcher @RayRedacted on Twitter also has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RayRedacted/status/1417829244869222400?s=20"&gt;a great thread&lt;/a&gt; going through some of the issues you may run into while running the tool and how to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wFqPLX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The investigation didn’t find evidence that US phones had been breached by Pegasus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XxMHIq"&gt;As a final note, Amnesty only provides instructions for installing the tool on macOS and Linux systems. For those looking to run it on Windows, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed the tool can be used by &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10"&gt;installing and using Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt; (WSL) and following Amnesty’s Linux instructions. Using WSL will require downloading and installing a Linux distro, like Ubuntu, which will take some time. It can, however, be done while you wait for your phone to backup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUBVfU"&gt;After running mvt, you’ll see a list of warnings that either list suspicious files or behavior. It’s worth noting that a warning doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve been infected. For me, some redirects that were totally above board showed up in the section where it checked my Safari history (sheets.google.com redirecting to docs.google.com, reut.rs redirecting to reuters.com, etc). Likewise, I got a few errors, but only because the program was checking for apps that I don’t have installed on my phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3bTEI"&gt;The story around Pegasus has likely left many of us regarding our phones with a bit more suspicion than usual, regardless of whether we’re likely to be targeted by a nation-state. While running the tool could (hopefully) help to ease some fears, it’s probably not a necessary precaution for many Americans. NSO Group has said its software cannot be used on phones with US numbers, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/?itid=hp_alert"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the investigation didn’t find any evidence that US phones had been successfully breached by Pegasus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7yEJK"&gt;While it’s nice to see that Amnesty made this tool available with solid documentation, it only really helps to address the privacy concerns around Pegasus. As we’ve seen recently, it doesn’t take a government targeting your phone’s microphone and camera to get private information — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;data broker industry&lt;/a&gt; could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"&gt;selling your location history&lt;/a&gt; even if your phone is Pegasus-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5zq5A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new athlete wellness trend just dropped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 U.S. Olympic Track &amp;amp;amp; Field Team Trials - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N-oiFJLbT37PgVnC1tGZPpyYxAQ=/0x0:5303x3535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614057/1324406292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Distance runner Galen Rupp is using blood flow restriction during the Tokyo Olympics.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Cliff Hawkins / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmVuy4"&gt;Athletes love a good wellness trend. Anything that promises to boost performance or give the slightest edge to anyone competing at the highest level of their sport &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evqe3z/why-its-so-easy-for-athletes-to-buy-into-junk-science"&gt;is going to find the ears&lt;/a&gt; of elite athletes and Olympians — even (or especially) if it looks like a torture device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAcBuW"&gt;In 2016, the fad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/8/12402038/olympics-2016-cupping-therapy-cryotheraphy-kinesio-tape-fads"&gt;was cupping&lt;/a&gt;: a technique that used suction cups as pain relief, leaving athletes like Michael Phelps looking like they’d just fought off a giant octopus. This year, its blood flow restriction, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/sports/olympics/athletes-blood-flow-restriction.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Some swimmers and runners are applying tourniquet-like bands to their arms and legs in the hopes that it’ll boost their training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd93hA"&gt;The strategy was first developed in 1966 by Japanese powerlifter Yoshiaki Sato, but it’s only just &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a34096061/blood-flow-restriction-training-science/"&gt;caught on&lt;/a&gt; with high-profile athletes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the past few years. American swimmer Michael Andrew and Galen Rupp, an American distance runner, are both using blood flow restriction during Olympic training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xOpQa"&gt;Like any good performance-enhancing trend, there’s still only limited evidence showing if or how it works. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26118847/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that athletes like rugby, football, and netball players increased their muscle strength and endurance after training with blood flow restriction for a few weeks. It could boost strength by increasing stress on muscle cells, which promotes muscle development, researchers speculate. But there have only been a few research studies on the technique. “Only 9 studies exist on this topic, making concrete conclusions tentative,” wrote the authors of one 2015 &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2015/06000/is_blood_flow_restriction_training_beneficial_for.5.aspx"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pX3sIt"&gt;That’s been the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/8/12402038/olympics-2016-cupping-therapy-cryotheraphy-kinesio-tape-fads"&gt;for other tools&lt;/a&gt;, like cupping and Kinesio tape, which athletes have stretched across joints to try to avoid injuries or prevent pain. The benefits of strategies like these are hard to prove, and athletes tend to adopt them based on anecdotal evidence from peers or if they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they help — regardless of concrete evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSiY3l"&gt;At the end of the day, though, maybe that’s fine. The placebo effect is powerful, and sports are as much mental as they are physical. There’s a risk that having high-profile athletes put so much emphasis on unproven tools might spread misinformation or distract from good sports science, John Sullivan, a clinical psychologist and sport scientist, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evqe3z/why-its-so-easy-for-athletes-to-buy-into-junk-science"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Blood flow restriction may not be something that people can or should do at home: the equipment is &lt;a href="https://www.smarttoolsplus.com/detail.cfm/id/398/name/smartcuffs?rfsn=2703477.8bcb0b"&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.issaonline.com%2Fblog%2Findex.cfm%2F2020%2Fblood-flow-restriction-training-what-trainers-need-to-know&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F21%2F22587574%2Fblood-flow-restriction-athlete-performance-trend" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be dangerous&lt;/a&gt; if not done correctly. But for elite athletes under the constant supervision of sports scientists, as long as a strategy doesn’t hurt, believing that it helps might actually be enough to give them an edge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Khalid’s latest music video is a big, sloppy kiss to Silicon Valley </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHBF8Q1GfJwBqsg1TzhEgLLVeqc=/43x0:679x424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613786/khalid_1.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcIMoz"&gt;Grammy-nominated singer Khalid has a new album coming out, and the first single, “New Normal,” is as smooth and breezy as a summer afternoon, which is weird because the video that accompanies the track is pretty much a venture capitalist’s dream come true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIpiNF"&gt;The video depicts a futuristic utopia full of skyscraper gardens, autonomous vehicles, drone deliveries, and smart homes. Khalid’s video is brimming with real products from real companies, not generic versions — a sign that the singer maybe had some input from Silicon Valley in crafting his love letter to our &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/"&gt;surveillance capitalist nightmare of a future&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BR4o2n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The video depicts a futuristic utopia full of skyscraper gardens, autonomous vehicles, drone deliveries, and smart homes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gWadvc"&gt;You know things are off to an interesting start when Khalid, rocking some sick blueish purple hair, rolls up to his apartment in a robotaxi from autonomous vehicle startup Zoox. The company, which is owned by Amazon, only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;just unveiled the toaster-shaped driverless shuttle&lt;/a&gt; last December. It’s not even available to the public yet, but in Khalid’s imagined future, the road is teeming with Zoox shuttles — and only Zoox shuttles. (I was tipped off to the video by a PR representative from Zoox, but have yet to receive a reply as to whether the company paid for the product placement.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJRghN9AnbmNV9efK3ps0aDFSi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731443/khalid_1.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BZdGCv"&gt;As Khalid dances through the interior of LA’s Bradbury Building (&lt;a href="https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/things-to-do/discover-blade-runner-locations-in-los-angeles"&gt;made famous by &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a more realistic version of the future), other people are inserting packages into drones that buzz around the building’s vast atrium. Why are the drones inside the building? Won’t they just smash into the skylight? Is there some kind of rooftop portal for the drones that managed to get installed despite the Bradbury Building’s designation as a national historical landmark in 1977? These and other questions go unanswered as Khalid continues to lazily shimmy through the song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1O0oR2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The singer then enters what I can only describe as a sanitized version of Korben Dallas’ apartment in ‘The Fifth Element’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cv9kdP"&gt;The singer then enters what I can only describe as a sanitized version of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amiJFKChM8E"&gt;Korben Dallas’ apartment in &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (another more accurate depiction of our chaotic and punitive future compared to this). The room is barely bigger than a closet, but the walls are lined with hydroponic plants, which I guess is supposed to make us feel better about living in what’s basically a well-lit coffin. Khalid uses a spray bottle to water his plants. We still have spray bottles in the future! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEWb6W"&gt;But maybe I spoke too soon, because the next shot shows us an automatic watering system activated by Khalid’s PS5. Again, this raises a lot of questions: how far into the future can this be, if he still has a PS5? Maybe he’s into retro consoles? And why would the PS5 be controlling his water filtration system? Is it now a smart home hub? I’m so confused. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4fk8gBzLBCAseqtOlb7eqD-AP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731474/khalid_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5BkUZ"&gt;Outside, swarms of knee-high delivery robots jockey for space on the sidewalk. The marketing team at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus"&gt;Starship Technologies&lt;/a&gt; must be kicking themselves over their failure to get their brand name in this video. Khalid sings into some sort of smart home panel on his wall, and his vocals are transmitted through the delivery robots apparently. Not sure how I feel about sidewalk robots that sing while also trampling our toes, but let’s move on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rgY3XP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only the finest fintech for our guy Khalid. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R977qU"&gt;Then, in what appears to be a particularly shameless moment of product placement, the singer remotely pays for something on his smart home panel (for what? it’s unclear) using Chime, a startup said to be worth $14.5 billion. Does anyone actually use Chime? Khalid sure does. Who needs the Cash app? Only the finest fintech for our guy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBir8i"&gt;As the video winds down, we end on the image of Khalid opening his blinds to see a giant billboard outside his window advertising rocket trips. It’s a little unclear what the ad is selling. A 90-minute rocket trip to the moon would be really, really fast. Probably too fast for any of the quasi-realistic tech featured in this video. Is it point-to-point commercial rocket travel between LA and New York, in the vein of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16385026/elon-musk-spacex-rocket-transportation-point-to-point"&gt;Elon Musk’s aborted idea&lt;/a&gt; from a couple years ago? If that was the case, 90 minutes would be too long. Is Khalid’s record label, RCA, sponsoring these rocket trips? Color me skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8U57n5EgaVJlW-krDSuqDUHlac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731498/Screen_Shot_2021_07_21_at_3.11.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w9Xxq7"&gt;Khalid’s unabashed love for Silicon Valley culture shouldn’t be that surprising. After all, the singer debuted his single “New Normal” during a live performance at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceflight launch&lt;/a&gt;, which sent Virgin CEO Richard Branson to the very edge of space. He clearly has a soft spot for huge, multinational companies seeking to alter the fabric of our reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LytE4"&gt;But while the video may be unrestrained in its romantic feelings for Big Tech’s quest to dominate our lives, the lyrics are actually a little more nuanced, even kind of defeatist. “Although I can’t promise you much / You’ll be finе, you’ll be fine,” Khalid croons. I really hope that turns out to be true. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing upvote and downvote buttons on tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_M1P-MIn06kHVxc6AYomsZa_Kk=/623x0:3473x1900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613644/E613I_0WEAQh4r0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sBuV18"&gt;Twitter is working on new upvote and downvote reactions for tweets to accompany the usual options to retweet and reply. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?s=20"&gt;Twitter confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was testing the feature for a small group of users on iOS, and it’s already been spotted according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iglehart97/status/1417912630996574208?s=20"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danlopez016/status/1417913141397127168?s=20"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from users that are part of the test group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDaPM5"&gt;Twitter writes that iOS users may see upvote and downvotes in several different styles (up and down arrows, a heart icon and a down arrow, and thumbs up and thumbs down icons) and that it’s testing the feature to “understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them.” Currently votes are not public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m0fQh5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some of you on iOS may see different options to up or down vote on replies. We're testing this to understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your downvotes aren’t public, while your upvotes will be shown as likes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hrBfrKQdcY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hrBfrKQdcY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DqFZrD"&gt;While Twitter hasn’t said if it plans to add up and down voting as a permanent feature (or how voting affects what you see in your feed), there are clear parallels to be drawn to Reddit, which features upvoting and downvoting as a way of surfacing a subreddit’s favorite replies, responses, and posts. Twitter says that for now though upvotes and downvotes don’t impact the order of tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0GXxh"&gt;Twitter’s toyed with other kinds of tweet interactions in the past, including reactions that &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;appeared to mimic the emoji reactions&lt;/a&gt; Facebook uses for Facebook posts and Messenger messages. Twitter’s product lead Kayvon Beykpour has also said that the company planned to work on dislikes last year, claiming the feature was one of Twitter’s many “top priorities” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392?s=20"&gt;in response to a user’s tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says SpaceX holds Bitcoin, ribs Jack Dorsey at conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla CEO Elon Musk Testifies In SolarCity Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qV-H5_8gw019wI1mjbJBDxAKS7M=/0x0:3807x2538/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613631/1233961984.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZqRJGX"&gt;“SpaceX, Tesla, and I own Bitcoin,” Elon Musk said at a Bitcoin conference today. Though Tesla no longer allows people to pay for cars using Bitcoin, the automaker hasn’t sold its Bitcoin, he said. “We’re not selling any Bitcoin, nor am I selling anything personally or nor is SpaceX selling any Bitcoin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSbMF5"&gt;In addition, Musk disclosed that he owned Ethereum and — unsurprisingly — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387486/dogecoin-run-valuation-cryptocurrency-spike-elon-musk"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;. The price of Ethereum, which was already rising today, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-speak-about-cryptocurrency-at-b-word-conference.html"&gt;rose further on the disclosure.&lt;/a&gt; Dogecoin rose early in the panel to almost 21 cents, before dipping to about 19 cents by the end of the panel, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/dogecoin"&gt;according to Coindesk data&lt;/a&gt;. Musk spoke at a panel with Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and payment company Square, and Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of ARK Invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3xhXNf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I might pump but I don’t dump.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AHPCg0"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;Tesla disclosed it had invested $1.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in Bitcoin; some of that investment was sold in the first quarter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;at a $101 million profit&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;accepting Bitcoin in late March&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;abruptly reversed itself in May&lt;/a&gt;, just 49 days later. The change was because of concern about Bitcoin’s energy use — and Tesla said it would resume accepting Bitcoin when mining became more environmentally sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGRutf"&gt;“I might pump but I don’t dump,” Musk said today. “I definitely do not believe in getting the price high and selling or anything like that. I would like to see Bitcoin succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBMY48"&gt;Musk has courted the opprobrium of some investors by clashing with people who believe Bitcoin is the only worthwhile cryptocurrency. &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/71040/elon-musk-dogecoin-can-beat-bitcoin-hands-down"&gt;Musk has said Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt; can “beat Bitcoin hands down.” Tesla’s reversal on Bitcoin as a payment method contributed to a crash in Bitcoin value in April. Bitcoin’s dip in value may have cost Tesla $90 million, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/elon-musks-tesla-may-have-lost-90-million-in-the-recent-crypto-crash/articleshow/83773974.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; estimated&lt;/a&gt; in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUdrnG"&gt;At one point, Musk asked Dorsey if he would accept Bitcoin as a payment for advertising on Twitter. Dorsey dodged the question, though he’d earlier promoted his Bluesky project, first announced in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub"&gt;announced in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. By January this year, it didn’t seem to have gotten much further — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510782417920001"&gt;Dorsey wrote that Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is still “in the process of interviewing and hiring folks” for Bluesky. “My biggest focus right now is on a decentralized social media protocol, we’re calling it Bluesky,” he said today. “It’s super, super early.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3bs9z"&gt;But Dorsey’s ambitions for Bitcoin are high, even if he doesn’t think Twitter should accept it as a payment. “My hope is that it creates world peace,” Dorsey said of the cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Oculus Quest update lets you easily invite others to play</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-OIU1O4ix0BYc7bDFEoqVw6k_M=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613411/echovrinvite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UTi0bV"&gt;Oculus is rolling out its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fnew-oculus-software-update-makes-it-easier-to-play-games-with-friends-and-adds-new-security-settings%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;v31 software update&lt;/a&gt; to Quest and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Quest 2 headsets&lt;/a&gt; starting today, and it’s filled with some nice quality-of-life improvements. The big one is it’ll be easier to invite friends and recent teammates who aren’t friends to play a game or experience an app together. When you’re in game or in app, pressing the Oculus button will pull up the universal menu as usual, but soon, more apps will show a new “Invite to App” button next to the “Resume” and “Quit” buttons. If friends accept your invite, you’ll be able to see them in the menu. This feature will roll out soon in games like &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blaston&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demeo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Echo VR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ForeVR Bowl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hyper Dash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PokerStars VR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBeCSI"&gt;If you don’t want to corral the group within VR, an upcoming update to the Oculus app on iOS and Android will let you create a multiplayer session then and there. For supported games and apps, you’ll be able to whip up a link that can be shared with others to join the group. You can also choose how long the link will be active. Any major platform with a social component should have intuitive invite tools like these, and I’m glad to see that Oculus is making some progress here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qpLsGKr0C8er9zdGEvhzi-JLdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731449/oculussecurity5.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qy0kpr"&gt;Other features coming in v31 may or may not get as much use, depending on how you use your Quest headset, but are nevertheless important. With the update, the Browser app will also gain the ability to save and autofill passwords, secured with an unlock pattern. Both the unlock pattern and passwords are stored on device, Oculus says in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fnew-oculus-software-update-makes-it-easier-to-play-games-with-friends-and-adds-new-security-settings%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX0uI0"&gt;Oculus is also adding send and read receipts to the Messenger app as well as reaction emoji — straight from Facebook. Admittedly, this should make it easier to respond to people instead of fumbling with the virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HgkRsa"&gt;If you’re waiting for v31 to hit your headset, keep in mind that it may take a few weeks to arrive on yours.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix thinks games matter more than buying movie studios</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Netflix stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKPCifbL-c4n7OssZgfLOJGpchw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613287/netflix-stock-0883.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghjZPn"&gt;As Netflix’s streaming rivals like Prime Video and HBO Max’s WarnerMedia focus on consolidation and studio acquisitions, Netflix is instead prioritizing its own service and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;investment in games&lt;/a&gt; over snapping up any available studio IP. It’s a refreshing shift away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;buying distressed movie studios&lt;/a&gt; or long-forgotten catalogs. But will it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HRDnf"&gt;Netflix spelled out its streaming strategy in its &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;second quarter letter&lt;/a&gt; to its shareholders. Citing recent mergers between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22448140/warner-bros-discovery-warnermedia-new-name-merger-att"&gt;WarnerMedia and Discovery&lt;/a&gt; and the last decade of acquisitions and mergers between major media properties — for example, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;Disney and Fox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/13/20746894/cbs-viacom-merger-acquisition-all-access-mtv-bet-streaming-value"&gt;Viacom and CBS&lt;/a&gt; — the company said it doesn’t “believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if at all.” (If I’m a streaming service right now, surely that one has to sting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhE8ao"&gt;Moreover, Netflix isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;shopping for studios&lt;/a&gt; in the same way its rivals have been. Netflix’s strategy instead continues to be simply making itself better. Put another way, Netflix wants to be more like social apps than other streaming services. Its main competitor in the space, according to Netflix, is itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwQkhV"&gt;“While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as ‘must-have’ and we haven’t yet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon,” the company wrote in its shareholders letter. “In the race to entertain consumers around the world, we continue to compete for screen time with a broad set of firms like YouTube, Epic Games and TikTok (to name just a few). But, we are mostly competing with ourselves to improve our service as fast as we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRvH9V"&gt;For a company that seems uninterested in shopping for movie studios, Netflix executives touched on the acquisition and consolidation race a number of times during the earnings call on Tuesday. While Netflix is open to the right opportunity, the company’s top brass said that Netflix is “picky” when it comes to assets and IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fJqqwc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as ‘must-have’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CwcIcx"&gt;To be clear, Netflix is still leading in the ongoing battle for our eyeballs (and our money). Netflix, which has around 209 million paid subscriptions, is most closely tailed by Disney Plus, which has roughly half that number of paid memberships. With its decade-plus lead on other streaming services, Netflix has more runway to experiment with its product and take the kinds of risks that smaller services simply cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DlqWw"&gt;That brings us to games. While Netflix hasn’t given us a specific timeline for game releases, beyond saying the initiative would be a multiyear endeavor, the company did say it believes “the time is right” to explore the expansion. Netflix has said repeatedly that it believes its primary competitors are high-engagement venues like TikTok and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But Netflix’s dive into gaming in earnest — rather than through one-off experiments like a &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; game or even &lt;em&gt;Bandersnatch —&lt;/em&gt; comes at a transitional time for the streaming giant as the world begins to reopen and streaming faces new hurdles for hooking and retaining subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5XIXc"&gt;The company said that it added 1.5 million paid memberships in the second quarter of 2021 over its 1 million guidance forecast, even while it lost some 400,000 paid net adds. But while the company said its business is healthy and its churn rate — the number of members leaving the service — is down when compared to a more “comparable” quarter from 2019, CFO Spencer Neumann said during the company’s earnings interview that Netflix is still feeling “a little bit of that drag in terms of our acquisition growth as we’re kind of working through what we hope is — and we can’t be sure — but what we hope is the tail end of this covid chopiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8a0xp"&gt;When looking at the company’s future challenges this way, Netflix’s big bet on gaming tracks. It creates new ways to extend the shelf life of content and characters that are already resonating with viewers. But what would Netflix games even look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tv4xuL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix believes games will help it build engagement around its content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cev1P5"&gt;Speaking to the company’s strategy for gaming moving forward, Netflix COO and chief product officer Greg Peters reiterated during the call that the company viewed gaming as “an extension of the core entertainment offering that we’ve been focused on for the last 20 years.” It plans to develop games for mobile first, though other formats may be considered down the line. And while Netflix plans to experiment with its approach to gaming, Peters said it will include licensing opportunities, games that build on its existing IP, and standalone games. According to Peters, that could even include a game that generates enough hype to be spun into a film or series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yEuX4"&gt;“Just as we’ve continuously expanded our offering by adding new genres, unscripted, film, local-language programming, animation, on and on, we think we have an opportunity to add games to that offering and deliver more entertainment value to our members,” Peters said. He added that the company planned to “start relatively small” and that Netflix’s foray into the gaming space would be a “multi-year effort.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWfn1U"&gt;Whether the gamification of Netflix content will help it scale in any meaningful way is impossible to say right now. But Netflix’s focus on content and product over IP acquisitions and mergers — the preferred play by most of its streaming peers at present — indicates that Netflix is very much still operating in a league of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC pledges to fight unlawful right to repair restrictions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfbtWGEnAjvFfrFzdf_YMqEGuRY=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613129/1232439143.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDOho7"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission formally pledged to take on unlawful “right to repair” restrictions in a new policy statement issued Wednesday. The new policy could spell trouble for smartphone manufacturers like Apple that strictly inhibit users’ abilities to repair their own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nditej"&gt;Wednesday’s new right to repair policy statement commits the FTC to encouraging competition in product repair markets with “vigor,” according to Chair Lina Khan. The statement, which was approved unanimously, makes it official FTC policy for the agency to use its existing authorities to support independent repair shops and lower repair costs for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77QymA"&gt;“While efforts by dominant firms to restrict repair markets are not new, changes in technology and more prevalent use of software has created fresh opportunities for companies to limit independent repair,” Khan said Wednesday. “These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunities for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, delay timely repairs, and undermine resiliency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li1Iyl"&gt;The statement comes just days after the White House endorsed similar rules in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; on economic competition. In the order, signed by President Joe Biden on July 9th, the White House explicitly calls out smartphone makers that “impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools.” At Wednesday’s meeting, the FTC did not name any specific companies or industries that it could target in future investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2qAEj"&gt;The move was lauded by right to repair advocates like iFixit. In a statement Wednesday, iFixit’s US policy lead Kerry Sheehan said, “The FTC’s progress addressing repair restrictions shows how much momentum Right to Repair has achieved, and how powerful our community can be when we work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j8wy9"&gt;“The adoption of today’s policy statement makes clear that the Commission will investigate unlawful repair restrictions, using the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and other consumer protection laws, as well as antitrust law to promote fair and open repair markets,” Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KImRzw"&gt;Wednesday’s open session was just the second since Khan was confirmed as chair at an agency that traditionally works behind closed doors. In the first proceeding earlier this month, Khan’s FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559131/ftc-open-meeting-antitrust-chair-lina-khan-sherman-act-powers"&gt;passed a pair of competition measures&lt;/a&gt;, setting the agency up to take more aggressive action on antitrust violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRBzO5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 7/21/21 at 3:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from iFixit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this WSJ investigation of TikTok’s algorithm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMtiMh2tey_Xd8nIfRb4KxX7x-I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613102/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dru3s"&gt;TikTok users often express awe or dismay at the seemingly uncanny accuracy of the app’s recommendation algorithm. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/inside-tiktoks-highly-secretive-algorithm/investigation-how-tiktok-algorithm-figures-out-your-deepest-desires/6C0C2040-FF25-4827-8528-2BD6612E3796"&gt;published a video&lt;/a&gt; today that dives into how TikTok customizes your feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk7cbr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; investigators ran an experiment where they created bot accounts with assigned interests. The bots “watched” videos in TikTok, pausing or replaying any that had images or hashtags relevant to those interests. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; team reviewed the results with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth"&gt;Guillaume Chaslot&lt;/a&gt;, an algorithm expert who previously worked at YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psGVNF"&gt;The findings line up with TikTok’s explanations of how its recommendations work. TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you"&gt;has previously said&lt;/a&gt; the For You feed is personalized based on the kinds of videos you interact with, how you interact with them, details about the videos themselves, and account settings like language and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TXUmq"&gt;If you hesitate on a weird video that caught you off guard, there’s no way for the algorithm to differentiate that from content you actually like and want to see more of. That’s how some people end up with a bunch of For You recommendations that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/your-tiktok-feed-embarrassing/619257/"&gt;don’t seem to reflect their interests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K3wysh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Look at this hashtag map we put together. In the middle is the mainstream of TikTok. The arms are the rabbit holes. As you go down the arms, the content has less views and can be less moderated. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Niva4NT7LO"&gt;https://t.co/Niva4NT7LO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dKp2NtQ3lu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dKp2NtQ3lu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joanna Stern (@JoannaStern) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1417856559611359239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJEMS"&gt;Though humans have more diverse tastes than bots, the experiment demonstrates how quickly a user can be exposed to far reaches of potentially harmful content. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, TikTok identified the interests of some of the bots in as few as 40 minutes. One of the bots fell into a rabbit hole of depressive videos, while another ended up at videos about election conspiracies. Though as Will Oremus &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1417866336609488898"&gt;points out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, algorithmic rabbit holes can also bring people to positive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub3Sd3"&gt;The video has a lot of details and visualizations, so it’s a good way to wrap your head around the “magic” of how TikTok works. Watch the video above or &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/inside-tiktoks-highly-secretive-algorithm/investigation-how-tiktok-algorithm-figures-out-your-deepest-desires/6C0C2040-FF25-4827-8528-2BD6612E3796"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; site&lt;/a&gt; — though be warned it includes clips from TikToks that reference depression, suicide, and eating disorders. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ brief trip to space was also a commercial for Rivian</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iA6X63ZZHK1q1VUfjTOWbI_Q6So=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613044/rivian_blue_origin_4830.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos by Joey Roulette / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ush37m"&gt;After years of preparation and billions of dollars spent on the project, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos got to be one of the first people to ride a rocket built by his &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;company, Blue Origin, to the edge of space. But the event itself was also a chance for Bezos to promote a third investment in the wider Amazon portfolio: EV startup Rivian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mu78zh"&gt;Throughout the broadcast, Rivian’s electric pickup truck and SUV could be seen shuttling Bezos and his fellow astronauts around — an unsurprising decision considering Amazon now owns &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1388538580881002501"&gt;more than 10 percent of the EV startup&lt;/a&gt; after leading and participating in multiple funding rounds. The hosts of Blue Origin’s livestream made sure to let everyone watching know what they were seeing, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r2ErQG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With commercial space, everything’s an ad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0W5BsR"&gt;“And here the astronauts come. There you see Jeff Bezos in the foreground, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578356/blue-origin-new-shepard-teen-jeff-bezos-space-anonymous-auction"&gt;Oliver Daemen&lt;/a&gt; stepping into the Rivian,” Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s director of “astronaut and orbital sales,” cheerily said during the broadcast as the group hopped in one of the startup’s SUVs to head to the rocket for their ride to space. Then we got a long, continuous aerial shot of the electric SUV driving toward the pad, split side-by-side during an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558908/wally-funk-flight-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-new-shepard"&gt;Mercury 13 legend Wally Funk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng3D2D"&gt;After the crew safely landed an hour later, there they were again: a set of Rivian pickups and SUVs rumbling over the West Texas landscape to greet the recently returned astronauts. (The electric vehicles were tucked in among a few other pickup trucks and SUVs made by Ford — which also owns more than 10 percent of Rivian.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CrcqTB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10662656"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ljI34"&gt;The Rivians — likely on loan, due to the fact that they’re still wearing manufacturer plates — weren’t just there for the sake of the broadcast, either. At one point, Blue Origin used the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/rivians-camp-kitchen-in-action/"&gt;slide-out camping kitchen&lt;/a&gt; on a pair of Rivian pickups to cook up sausages and carne asada for guests attending the launch — an optional feature that the startup has promoted a lot in the run-up to production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5icsb"&gt;Blue Origin is a private company, and much like Virgin Galactic — which launched founder Richard Branson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;to the edge of space&lt;/a&gt; less than two weeks ago — this first mission was as much about promotion as it was about science or exploration. But while Branson’s event had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;music festival vibe&lt;/a&gt;, Blue Origin’s was more in line with Bezos’ notorious calculation. It was a chance for him to promote the things he plans to spend his time on now that he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;no longer Amazon CEO&lt;/a&gt;, like his space company and his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321793/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-new-president-ceo"&gt;climate fund&lt;/a&gt;, and to toss a bone to the electric vehicle company that Amazon has dumped a bunch of money into. Perhaps the only surprising thing is that the delivery van Rivian is building for Amazon wasn’t there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LgV6GY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivian already has plenty of money — but it is planning an IPO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2bGwLB"&gt;It’s not like Rivian, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;delayed the first deliveries of its pickup truck and SUV to later this year&lt;/a&gt;, really &lt;em&gt;needs &lt;/em&gt;the attention. The startup has already raised more than $8 billion to date. Rivian has also already proven adept at coming up with &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33548089/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-long-way-up-tv/"&gt;its own effective cross-promotions&lt;/a&gt;. But Rivian &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;currently in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;preparing an initial public offering&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s possible this display of corporate synergy plays right into the hands of the bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3En8Y"&gt;The commercialization of the space industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/20981714/spacex-commercial-spaceflight-space-industry-decade-nasa-business"&gt;been happening for a while&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s really ramped up in recent years as companies like Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX matured. These companies have set out to dominate everything from the “boring” tasks like cargo runs and science missions to the riskier endeavors like strapping people inside a spaceship. They’ve realized the value of the eyeballs these missions attract, too. After all, before SpaceX launched the first humans to space from United States soil last year, those astronauts also took a promotional ride to the rocket — &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/05/13/tesla-model-x-new-official-vehicle-transport-nasa-astronauts-spacex/#"&gt;in a Tesla Model X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
