    <title>Facebook says it’s spent $13 billion on ‘safety and security’ since 2016</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jMEL6o"&gt;Facebook says it’s spent over $13 billion on “safety and security” since 2016 and has 40,000 people dedicated to the area, offering a glimpse at its operations after a week of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=bigtop-breadcrumb"&gt;leaks published by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company used the numbers as an example of how it’s addressed problems on Facebook and Instagram, saying the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s stories lacked “important context” about complex issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpq9U9"&gt;“In the past, we didn’t address safety and security challenges early enough in the product development process,” Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/our-progress-addressing-challenges-and-innovating-responsibly/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “But we have fundamentally changed that approach. Today, we embed teams focusing specifically on safety and security issues directly into product development teams, allowing us to address these issues during our product development process, not after it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6m7uZX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the past, we didn’t address safety and security challenges early enough”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K7d1nW"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;alleged that Facebook knew of serious problems like &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-vaccinated-11631880296?mod=article_inline"&gt;false COVID-19 information&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;negative emotional effects&lt;/a&gt; on users but delayed fixing them in fear of weakening engagement with its platforms. Facebook executive Nick Clegg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681056/facebook-vp-disputes-report-wall-street-journal-instagram-teens-clegg"&gt;issued a rebuttal&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend, accusing the paper of “deliberate mischaracterizations of what we are trying to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfzR1z"&gt;Much of Facebook’s new response recasts allegations from the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; in a more positive light — focusing not on whether it acted too late, but on the ways it ultimately responded, like removing 20 million pieces of false COVID-19 and vaccination content and blocking 3 billion fake accounts in the first half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEAbfE"&gt;If accurate, the new safety and security figures do offer an update on some earlier Facebook numbers. The company has apparently quadrupled its staff in that area since 2017, when it employed 10,000 people and promised to double the number within a year. (The figure includes outside contractors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aB7OJQ"&gt;Meanwhile, the $13 billion number &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-just-learned-the-true-cost-of-fixing-its-problems/"&gt;backs up a 2018 statement&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook would devote “billions of dollars per year” to safety and security, working out to an average of more than $2 billion annually. We don’t know how that money was distributed between 2016 and 2021, but Facebook made high-profile promises about ramping up investment during 2017 and 2018, which saw scrutiny over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16587342/facebook-senate-hearing-russia-google-twitter"&gt;Facebook’s role in election propaganda campaigns&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica privacy controversy&lt;/a&gt; — so it’s likely a lot of the spending came from recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Specialized’s next-generation Turbo e-bikes are basically computers on wheels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Specialized’s Turbo Vado" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/705fxLyRcGcVoacD9eF7bUzag7I=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888774/DSC_0704.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XS289b"&gt;Specialized is launching next-generation versions of two of its most popular electric bikes, the Turbo Vado and Turbo Como, as well as producing a brand new model, the Turbo Tero. And while the bikes themselves look fantastic, the big story is the upgraded technology operating within. That’s because Specialized has improved these e-bikes to the point where they are basically computers on wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abC1M2"&gt;Specialized is making its e-bikes much smarter with a host of new features on the software side. That includes over-the-air software updates, meaning customers can enjoy new features as Specialized develops them over time. The company’s Mission Control app is designed to digitize the experience, providing a place where customers can receive OTA software updates rather than having to bring their bike into the shop for minor updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AGGCTx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Specialized is making its e-bikes much smarter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eUGAyW"&gt;“As we learn and continue to develop from a software standpoint, the bike gets better over time,” Ian Kenny, product manager for Specialized’s Turbo lineup, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s a pretty transformational shift in the bike industry, that matches a lot of what customers expect on the electric vehicle side and the advanced technology that they’re used to having in their house.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E8WUXfMWmTTDIQ6f61dHb-Ag5mM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867110/DSC_0683.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specialized’s Turbo Como.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8pk6pZ"&gt;After connecting their bike to their phone through Bluetooth, customers can diagnose minor bugs or other software problems or tune the bike’s power settings to either increase or decrease the amount of assistance. If you want more of a workout while riding, you can decrease the amount of support or vice versa if you feel like arriving at your destination nice and dry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2gFbE"&gt;Specialized’s Turbo e-bikes all come with anti-theft technology, in which customers can use the app to disable the bike’s motor and activate a motion alarm system. Once locked, the motor cannot be activated by anyone else but the owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LwLmPg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Perhaps one of the coolest new features is the inclusion of a rear-facing Garmin radar&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ydUqKc"&gt;Perhaps one of the coolest new features is the inclusion of a rear-facing Garmin radar to detect vehicles as they approach from behind as you ride. Garmin says its radar can detect objects from up to 140 meters away, which should provide a comfortable buffer for anyone experiencing (justifiable) anxiety about riding alongside car traffic. Cars appear as yellow dots moving vertically along the left-hand side of the display, so all it takes is a quick glance to determine who’s coming up from behind. Riders can also opt for a haptic alert for approaching vehicles if they want to be extra cautious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRu6xL"&gt;All three bikes are speed pedelecs, meaning they are categorized as Class 3 e-bikes with a top speed of 28mph. The Specialized 2.2 motor is rated at 250W of nominal power, can put out 90Nm of torque, and is custom-made by the company in collaboration with Brose, a German company that makes e-bike motors. And the 710Wh battery is fully integrated and non-removable, which, depending on your preference, is either a nice design touch or drag when it comes to charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZKZL4"&gt;Each bike is designed for a different riding experience. The Vado is the “vehicle for everything,” including commuting, working out, running errands, or just a pleasurable ride. The Como is a more laid-back, upright style of riding, with its swept-back handlebars and low-step frame. And the Tero, as an amalgamation of a mountain bike and utility bike, is built for “all-terrain exploration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqp0ED"&gt;Much like the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360180/specialized-como-sl-ebike-review-price-specs"&gt;Turbo Como SL&lt;/a&gt; (which stands for Super Light), the next-gen Turbo bikes come with Gates carbon belt drives, which are quite popular with e-bike makers these days because they are cleaner and easier to maintain than traditional metal chain transmissions. The 11-gear shifter is powered by an Enviolo automatic shifter, which is fully enclosed, electronically powered, and never needs maintenance. The advantage of the automatic shifter is that the bike is supposed to always feel like it’s in the perfect gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t887Qf"&gt;The one downside is the price. Specialized makes fantastic e-bikes with top-of-the-line components — and as such, they can be really pricey. That’s certainly the case with the new Turbo bikes, which range from $3,250 up to $5,500. Let’s hope Congress includes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22590792/ebike-act-senate-brian-schatz-tax-credit-infrastructure"&gt;15 percent tax credit&lt;/a&gt; for new e-bike purchases in the budget reconciliation bill because every little bit helps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7s6vo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Visions is the most exciting Star Wars has been in a long time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="star wars visions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hnE7YunqaBzT5hEU5e7eNtECrNI=/988x0:3436x1632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888740/2021_08_12_trailer_uhd_r709f_still_02.088593.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“The Ninth Jedi” | Image: Lucasfilm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Producers at Lucasfilm explain how the anime anthology came about&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8DYGAt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt; is an idea that makes so much sense it’s a wonder it took this long to happen. The anthology takes some of the most talented names in anime — including studios like Production I.G. and Studio Trigger — and hands them the keys to the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe, with no concerns about continuity or what is or isn’t canon. The results are inventive and thrilling, from a rock opera set on Tatooine to the story of a droid that dreams of being a Jedi. It’s bold and creative — and the most exciting &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; has been in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMIEff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is a nine-part anthology, with each episode telling a completely original story. They’re all short — the longest is 22 minutes long, and some clock in at just 13 minutes — and, in a rarity for Disney Plus, the entire season is available to stream all at once. The most striking thing about the collection is how different each episode is, both in style and tone. The opening episode, called “The Duel,” is a mostly black-and-white story about dueling Sith warriors, structured like a classic samurai film. Later episodes include “T0-B1,” which looks and feels like a long-lost &lt;em&gt;Astro Boy &lt;/em&gt;episode, and “Lop &amp;amp; Echo,” an action-packed fable about a family torn apart by the Empire, featuring betrayal, intense sword combat, and aliens with giant bunny ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="JWycTd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lle0NNmvIyU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tJS2Yw"&gt;These episodes play with iconic &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; elements in interesting ways. In “The Twins,” a pair of Sith twins pilot a pair of Star Destroyers that are fused together to create a spacefaring behemoth. “The Ninth Jedi” follows a unique perspective, focusing on a sabersmith at a time when lightsabers and the Jedi who wield them are outlawed. And there are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; great twists on those series-defining laser swords, from a classic Japanese umbrella-style saber to ones that are curved and sharp like a metal blade. &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is a lot of fun just to look at and spot all of the unique details and twists. It takes something many of us know intimately and remixes it in often thrilling and creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yrIJQF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s been a cool recursive cycle, passing back and forth.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QE9s1Z"&gt;This idea of mashing a galaxy far, far away with lots of different forms of storytelling isn’t exactly new. It’s no secret that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160104-the-film-star-wars-stole-from"&gt;George Lucas was heavily inspired by the works of Akira Kurosawa&lt;/a&gt;, among others, when he initially conceived of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. In that way, an anime samurai story featuring Jedi makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5kIVo"&gt;“It’s this fusion of storytelling inspiring new storytelling,” explains &lt;em&gt;Visions &lt;/em&gt;executive producer James Waugh. “&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; was already the byproduct of that. I think actually hearing from these studios, what &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; meant to them and how it inspired them on their journey to become creators and storytellers, was really interesting. Because many of these creators — like Production I.G. — their work came back to Lucasfilm and inspired a lot of us. It’s been a cool recursive cycle, passing back and forth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="star wars visions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAb8eCvnSWRX6MZ6M-TxYPaUbJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865525/2021_08_12_trailer_uhd_r709f_still_03.086899.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Duel”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Brnu1Y"&gt;According to producer Kanako Shirasaki, the goal was to work with a range of creators in order to build an anthology with lots of variety — one that could show the depth possible in anime. “We wanted to showcase different Japanese studios, not just industry giants,” she says. “We wanted to choose studios with different backgrounds, who wanted to tell different stories in different styles.” Once chosen, the studios were then able to pitch a few ideas, and the team at Lucasfilm went through them “to make sure we didn’t have redundant storytelling,” says Waugh. He adds that “We chose the studios for the types of films they made. They have a point of view already that they’re known for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WD1B3P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You wouldn’t get that story if you were trying to fit things into a timeline.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8de9bm"&gt;One of the defining factors of &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is that none of the shorts fits into the established timeline. You won’t see familiar faces like Anakin or the Mandalorian — and that’s by design. Instead, the stories play with familiar themes and conventions, like lightsabers and the battle between the light and dark sides of the force. Waugh says the goal was to create shorts that were unlike anything else in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; canon; he cites the over-the-top action of “The Twins” as a great example. “You wouldn’t get that story if you were trying to fit things into a timeline,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN7BWv"&gt;That said, while the various tales from &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; aren’t part of the established canon right now, that doesn’t mean they won’t eventually make their way in. Waugh says that wasn’t part of the original plan, but he notes that it’s the nature of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; that ideas from one place often end up elsewhere. “There’s no intention currently of that type of transfer of ideas. But I always say this of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; in general: great ideas are always mined,” he says, noting the Dark Troopers as an example; they started out as a video game enemy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152431/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-6-star-wars-dark-forces-trooper-baby-yoda-grogu"&gt;eventually turned into a key plot point in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="rqtU0i"&gt;“The option will always be on the table,” Waugh says. “And I’m sure video game partners everywhere will want that lightsaber umbrella.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8s2Gy"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Star Wars: Visions &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is streaming on Disney Plus starting on September 22nd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M7RUpi_d1NvC6dms8FN9DTfueyo=/35x0:1925x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888574/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Ninth_Gen_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new iPad launches on September 24th at the same starting price as the last-gen model: $329.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eFnM4H"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only Apple device launching on September 24th — and we’re not just talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;2021 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The company also announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;new entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt; during its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt;, which comes outfitted with a new front-facing camera, a faster processor, and double the base storage. But are the improvements enough to justify an upgrade from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;last year’s iPad&lt;/a&gt;, or even picking it over its predecessor should you find the 2020 model on sale? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtWRe"&gt;To answer those questions, we’ve put together a comparison outlining the similarities and differences between the 2020 iPad and the forthcoming model, ahead of our official review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q5ZEcA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the new iPad Mini compares to the last-gen model","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22677944/apple-ipad-mini-2019-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade-worthwhile"},{"title":"The Apple rumors were wrong","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZ_LWLoLuu5J6bEtDlAoP8QPgW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859056/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Connect_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad features a 12MP front camera, which should allow for improved visuals during calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bRdkia"&gt;What’s improved on the 2021 iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TjCqm6"&gt;A 12MP ultrawide front-facing camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zXb2Or"&gt;Greater storage capacity, with base storage starting at 64GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z6T2vb"&gt;The A13 Bionic chip, replacing the A12 Bionic from 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DN1aVS"&gt;A True Tone display that adjusts color temperature to match your environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="QRGUCd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TR4t1L"&gt;Undoubtedly, one of the biggest selling points of the new iPad is its front-facing camera, which is a higher resolution than the 1.2MP camera found on the 2020 model. On paper, the this should translate to better video quality, whether for videoconferencing, livestreaming, or other activities. The newer model also provides support for 1080p recording at 25fps and 30fps, while the 2020 version only supports 1080p at 30fps. Additionally, the newer iPad can “follow” the subject as they move around the frame thanks to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;new Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt;, once reserved for the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyVT2g"&gt;There are also some notable improvements when it comes to the display, storage capacity, and performance. Unlike last year’s model, the latest iPad sports twice the capacity at 64GB and 256GB storage variants instead of 32GB and 128GB. In addition, thanks to Apple’s True Tone technology — something Apple introduced in 2016 with the first-gen iPad Pro — the display on the new entry-level tablet can adjust its color temperature to match your environment. If you’re outside, for example, the display will automatically adjust to be easier on your eyes. Finally, the 2021 model features Apple’s A13 Bionic chip, which Apple says is 20 percent faster than the A12 Bionic chip found in the eighth-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S2BoiQ"&gt;What’s the same on both models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="i2kFG4"&gt;The 8MP rear camera with f/2.4 aperture and digital zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wAQvQz"&gt;Slo-mo video support for 720p at 120fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v15Er8"&gt;The overall design — height, width, depth are identical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VrGhsf"&gt;Lightning connectivity (no USB-C)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zygx3w"&gt;They both have a headphone jack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P6YCYp"&gt;The list of compatible accessories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZC34dY"&gt;Battery life, which Apple quotes at nine to 10 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Js4ra"&gt;Wi-Fi 5 and optional LTE connectivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XAYdAe"&gt;Both run iPadOS 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oxxrXk"&gt;In most other ways, the 2021 iPad is identical to its predecessor. The improved front-facing camera should mean better video calls, but aside from that, the device sports the same 8MP wide camera with an f/2.4 aperture on the rear, support for HDR, and a digital zoom. Both tablets also feature similar video recording capabilities, offering slo-mo video support for 720p at 120fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9GNifIWvm_UZCunuitsSeh4gspI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859063/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_ProCreate_Pencil_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the 2020 and 2021 iPad feature an LCD display with 2160 x 1620 resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqZB6C"&gt;Design-wise, they’re nearly the same, meaning the newer tablet remains compatible with existing accessories like Apple’s Smart Keyboard and still has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a novelty among Apple’s current device lineup and modern devices in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWgK0z"&gt;Unlike the all-new iPad Mini, however, the 2021 iPad still features a home button with a Touch ID sensor and a Lightning port instead of USB-C, a frustrating liner note that’s also applicable to iPhone 13 models. Both are only compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil, too, which isn’t nearly as convenient to charge as the second-gen model released in 2018. While the new model charges wirelessly while magnetically docked to the side of the iPad Pro and latest iPad Air and iPad Mini, the last-gen Pencil still relies on the tablet’s Lightning connector and awkwardly juts out the bottom of the device when charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Deycqe"&gt;Both iPads are available in space gray or silver — no gold colorway this time around — with a 10.2-inch display and 2160 x 1620 resolution. They even weigh about the same; only the Wi-Fi version of the new model weighs a little less: 1.07 pounds, as opposed to 1.08.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w74709"&gt;Apple claims battery life is also identical across both devices, with the new iPad offering between nine and 10 hours of battery life, depending upon whether you’re using a cellular connection or Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, the 2021 model boasts twice the storage for the same price. The Wi-Fi-equipped iPad with 64GB of storage now starts at $329 — the same price the last-gen model started at with 32GB of storage. The newer model is also available in a 256GB configuration for $150 more, whereas the 2020 model could only be purchased in either 32GB or 128GB varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEll5t"&gt;As for the operating system, both models are compatible with iPadOS 15. The only difference is that the 2021 iPad comes with it pre-installed — eighth-gen iPad owners will need to download it. That means no matter which model you choose, you’ll be able to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime calls with Android and Windows users in a pinch&lt;/a&gt;, resize your widgets, filter notifications via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;Focus mode&lt;/a&gt;, and make use of a host of new iPadOS 15 features. With the final release of macOS Monterey later in the fall, you’ll also be able to drag and drop content between devices using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w2Wrqe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Goodbye and good riddance to Apple’s 64GB iPhones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"},{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: fundamental fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrX4eoQf6IHAkTM73kLYPYG2RUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859204/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_SplitView_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kywy7Z"&gt;Why might you stick with the 2020 iPad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RdQj5g"&gt;It’s still a good tablet, likely with years of support ahead of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wXzWg6"&gt;You really dig the gold colorway or the white bezels on the silver model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="57ijOI"&gt;Unlike the forthcoming iPad Mini, the latest entry-level iPad is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676532/apple-event-iphone-13-incremental-refinement-upgrade-specs"&gt;more of a refinement&lt;/a&gt; than a notable overhaul. It doesn’t feature a USB-C port or compatibility with the second-gen Apple Pencil, nor does it ditch the home button in favor of an edge-to-edge display. It’s still the most economical tablet in Apple’s lineup, however, and even the incremental upgrades are enough to render it an even better value at $329 than it was before. The faster performance afforded by the A13 Bionic is welcome, as is an upgraded 12MP camera at a time when we’re still all connecting virtually more often than we are in person. It even offers double the storage for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWWBw1"&gt;For some people, the subtle improvements will be enough. But for most? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bU1j6qbU7MsjLoMjDf7M-BCaIkY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859274/Apple_iPad_10_2_inch_Family_09142021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 iPad (second from the right) remains Apple’s most affordable tablet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p9EaqZ"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a new tablet and not just to upgrade, though, the choice gets a little easier when you consider availability. Apple officially discontinued the 2020 iPad with the introduction of the ninth-gen model, and though we routinely saw last year’s model discounted to as low as $300 over the past year, it’s recently been unavailable at nearly every retailer. Even if you wanted to pick up the 2020 model, you can’t, making the 2021 iPad the cheapest Apple tablet you can pick up outside of a used or refurbished model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPFmXm"&gt;If you regularly use your iPad to make video calls or livestream, the new front-facing camera may be enough reason to upgrade — or if you’re really hard-pressed for storage space. Outside that, though, you might be better off waiting for a more substantial refresh to Apple’s entry-level tablet or spending the extra $200 or so on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet equipped with an even faster processor, a larger display, and a USB-C port, along with a host of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Treasury sanctions cryptocurrency exchange to fight ransomware attacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Biden Praises House Adoption Of $3.5 Trillion Budget Plan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOlw-FZPFsN32hN4x43ni92EiJw=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888568/1234862597.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d42SMb"&gt;The Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364"&gt;issued its first sanctions&lt;/a&gt; against a cryptocurrency exchange on Tuesday as part of a series of actions targeting the use of digital currencies in ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqJqLL"&gt;Tuesday’s sanctions will block all trades involving the cryptocurrency exchange Suex and US entities. According to the Treasury Department, around 40 percent of all Suex transactions involve illegal activities. The department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is also issuing a new advisory warning that it may issue new sanctions against cryptocurrency exchanges, cyber insurance companies, and other financial institutions that facilitate ransomware payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4BN817"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will continue to crack down on malicious actors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iOHzN3"&gt;“Ransomware and cyber-attacks are victimizing businesses large and small across America and are a direct threat to our economy,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. “We will continue to crack down on malicious actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUefC4"&gt;These new measures are the Biden administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679952/ransomware-cryptocurrency-sanctions-treasury-biden"&gt;most significant move to curb&lt;/a&gt; the wave of ransomware attacks that have only become more frequent over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, one of the US’s largest fuel delivery pipelines, Colonial Pipeline, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;taken offline after a cyberattack&lt;/a&gt; that requested a ransom. Colonial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;paid more than $4 million&lt;/a&gt; to turn the system back on. That payment was partially recovered by US authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h81HYO"&gt;Last year, the Treasury Department issued a pair of advisories warning companies against paying cybercriminals demanding ransoms. The Department reiterated this stance on Tuesday, saying that it would update its ransomware guidance and issue a clear statement opposing ransomware payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOkIGJ"&gt;“As cyber criminals use increasingly sophisticated methods and technology, we are committed to using the full range of measures, to include sanctions and regulatory tools, to disrupt, deter, and prevent ransomware attacks,” Yellen said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now pay $3.99 per month to hear Marvel podcasts early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSVBgNkkyP9FsD7JgExI9lLfOcE=/0x0:2865x1910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888454/marvelpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SiriusXM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VyGmsw"&gt;SiriusXM is using Apple Podcasts to sell more subscriptions, specifically subscriptions for Marvel content. The company &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-launches-new-free-channel-and-premium-podcast-subscription-with-marvel-entertainment-on-apple-podcasts-301381205.html?tc=eml_cleartime"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a new Apple Podcast channel today for its Marvel content, along with a $3.99-per-month subscription offering called Marvel Podcasts Unlimited. Paying subscribers will receive early access to shows — they’ll be a week ahead of the wide release — along with exclusive titles, including &lt;em&gt;Declassified&lt;/em&gt;, a narrative documentary about the history of Marvel Comics. (These benefits are also available to SiriusXM subscribers within the SXM app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52SV3k"&gt;Apple is the exclusive third-party partner for Sirius’ Marvel subscription product, meaning, at least for now, it won’t be available through any other membership product. This news follows Sirius and Marvel agreeing to a deal &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/podcasts/marvel-entertainment-and-siriusxm-enter-a-major-multi-year-deal-to-create-original-podcasts-for-siriusxm-and-pandora"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to make shows exclusively for Sirius properties featuring Marvel’s iconic characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8FtmD"&gt;Comic podcasts have increasingly become potential drivers of subscriptions. Spotify and DC Comics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295156/dc-comics-spotify-universe-podcast-superhero"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a deal in February to launch shows together while HBO Max just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609212/hbo-max-podcast-exclusive-batman-audio-jeffrey-wright"&gt;premiered&lt;/a&gt; its new Batman audio series with plans to make it exclusive to its app. The reasons why are clear: people recognize the show names and characters, and they also seemingly love content based on comics — just look at Marvel movies’ success. Whether that same blockbuster status can be replicated in audio form, however, has yet to be realized. However, with Apple Podcasts on its side, and its coveted in-app subscribe button, Sirius might have a chance of finding a substantial new revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero now offers its 6 Pro Mesh Wi-Fi in a two-pack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GIOWCGf7Ma0VccNoNfmu_fNZdjU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888215/dseifert_201213_4337_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero Pro 6 now offers a two-pack for purchase, for when you need a little more, but not that much more.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pjYSB6"&gt;As of this week, you can finally pick up a two-pack of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Eero Pro 6 mesh Wi-Fi 6 &lt;/a&gt;routers for under $400. The move by the Amazon-owned company gives you more price-palatable choices for upgrading your existing Wi-Fi router to a faster, more powerful option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wr65uE"&gt;First announced when the Eero Pro 6 launched last year, the two-pack is now available through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Feero-pro-6-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-2-pack%2F6477842.p%3FskuId%3D6477842&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (although weirdly not on Eero’s own site). And currently, both sites are offering an extra 20 percent off for Prime and Best Buy members through September 28th. That means for around $320 you can blanket up to a 3,500-square-foot home in speedy Wi-Fi goodness using this tri-band, Wi-Fi 6 mesh router. (The single unit and three-pack also are currently discounted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0pMOm"&gt;Previously, your options were a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;single Eero Pro 6&lt;/a&gt; to cover 2,000 square feet for $229 or the more-than-most-people-need &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-pro-6-3-pack/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack&lt;/a&gt; to cover 6,000 square feet for $599. It has been &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to buy two Eero Pro 6 devices, but not easy. You had to hunt around on Amazon for it, and if you happened to land at BestBuy.com or Eero’s own website, you’d be out of luck or paying $60 more, for two individual Eeros. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WfqHrf31jlhJk4nMGa_P0rT6kU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865519/41CL6QZwZaL._SL1001_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two nodes are better than one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rZgAf8"&gt;The Eero two-pack is a great fit for anyone whose living space is somewhere between a studio apartment and a three-bedroom house in the ‘burbs. And of course, Wi-Fi coverage is not just about space. If you’ve got 1,500 square feet segmented by thick, brick walls and you want a wire-free way to spread the speed, an extra node or two will certainly come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwejoH"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 mesh system offers gigabit speed, Wi-Fi 6, and tri-band performance. Its satellite nodes that you place around your home also have two ethernet ports on them, so you can hardwire a TV or games console to one for a more reliable connection without it needing to be in the same room as your modem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUIB2m"&gt;The Eeros also have a Zigbee smart home hub built-in — which you can use to connect select Zigbee devices, including smart lightbulbs, door locks, smart plugs, and smart sensors. While it acts as the hub, you still need the Amazon Alexa app and an Amazon account to set up and manage the devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two ethernet ports give you some flexibility with the Eero Pro 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VIm6Y0"&gt;By offering this third price option, the very expensive Eero Pro 6 comes closer to competitors like Asus, with its two-pack &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenWiFi-AX-Whole-Home-Tri-Band/dp/B083Q45V1V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ZenWiFi AX Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System&lt;/a&gt; for $450. However, the Asus offers more control over network settings, which the Eero, despite its Pro tag, doesn’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVu4PX"&gt;If the price is still too steep for you, the non-pro Eero 6 routers cost $279 for a three-pack and cover up to 5,000 square feet. But you only get a dual-band setup and recommended speeds top out at 500 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tumblr’s subscription feature is now open to everyone in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Two Tumblr app screenshots of a blog titled “game over, gamer”. The first shows an introductory post with a list of games and examples of content like reviews and playthroughs. The second shows a Post Plus subscription page that says “subscribe for $1.99/ month, cancel anytime”." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFGq_cdi1HtmsxRGQspBa89cFxM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887944/Gaming_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post Plus for gamer content.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tumblr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="saqKwH"&gt;Tumblr is expanding the beta for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"&gt;Post Plus subscription feature&lt;/a&gt; to all users in the US today. Post Plus, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;Twitter’s Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, allows creators to designate some of their posts as only for paying subscribers. Tumblr is planning a full launch of the feature later in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtwdNP"&gt;Tumblr has made some changes since the limited beta that started in July. Post Plus creators can now directly block people who subscribe to them. Creators previously had to contact Tumblr support if they wanted to block a subscriber, which raised concerns among users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1xmhr"&gt;There’s now an option to set a subscription price to $1.99 a month, in addition to the existing $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 options. Creators can go back and paywall existing content, rather than being limited to only monetizing new posts. Tumblr is also removing the blue plus badge, similar to a Twitter verified badge, that appeared next to creators’ usernames.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Four Tumblr app screenshots showing examples of blogs for beauty tips and gaming. One shows the sign-up page for subscriptions, another shows a post being created, with options to set it for everyone or supporters only. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qqa0G4NVX6OLAol3zAy1JcoS5Vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865611/Group_Shot_29.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tumblr&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Views of Post Plus for subscribers and creators. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SVhjB2"&gt;Tumblr says several of the adjustments to the beta were made in response to user feedback. Predictably, many Tumblr users &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/"&gt;weren’t happy about the initial Post Plus announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Some users even organized a log-off protest, specifically citing concerns about the legality of monetizing fan work, though those concerns likely stem from &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2021/08/tumblr-post-plus-backlash-controversy-protest-copyright.html"&gt;misunderstandings of copyright law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGomBk"&gt;Many Tumblr creators already link out to their Patreon or Ko-fi accounts, so Post Plus is pitched as a way to support creators without leaving the platform. Tumblr has struggled to build back its user base after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266013/tumblr-porn-ban-lost-users-down-traffic"&gt;mass exodus&lt;/a&gt; that followed the site’s infamous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;2018 porn ban&lt;/a&gt;. According to Tumblr, almost half of its current users are Gen Z, and it hopes monetization features will help attract more young creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAVn8m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UckSp2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntIINp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NFT scammers are here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of NFTs falling into a sack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jx3duytUhUypiR7W0oeM_FE5PdU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69888007/acastro_210914_4753_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Collectors have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of NFTs; sometimes, the community helps claw them back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YerIST"&gt;Last month, Jeff Nicholas popped into the Discord channel for OpenSea, the popular NFT marketplace, looking for help with a royalties issue. Within minutes, someone by the name of “Pascal | OpenSea” responded, inviting him into a separate Discord called “OpenSea Support Server.” There, he was greeted by “Nate | OpenSea,” given a queue number, and eventually started talking through a resolution process with the two agents. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pascal_OpenSea"&gt;Pascal&lt;/a&gt; is the name of OpenSea’s customer support lead, and Nate might have been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain"&gt;Nate Chastain&lt;/a&gt;, its head of product &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677793/opensea-product-chief-resign-nft-insider-trading-accusations"&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0Kuse"&gt;But there was no Nate or Pascal, and Nicholas wasn’t in a customer support channel. He’d been targeted by a group of scammers masquerading as OpenSea employees, and they got right to work. Holding Nicholas in customer support purgatory, they would ping him intermittently, telling him his turn was approaching. By online customer service standards, it was typical — good, even, for how personal they were acting. Tailored messages, an exclusive Discord invite, and multiple team members, all working as fast as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mBaX9"&gt;If anything felt off in the conversations, it was that “Nate” kept calling him “my guy.” But between family obligations and customer service exhaustion, Nicholas overlooked the faux pas. After hours of back-and-forth, they casually suggested he share his screen with them. To Nicholas, this was just the next step in the troubleshooting process; for the scammers, their eyes began to glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yoPQbn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As the value of NFTs has increased, so too has the threat of scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UCihGm"&gt;Over the next hour, the scammers wiped out NFT apes, cats, and dogs from Nicholas’ wallet. Because he had shared his screen, they were able to snap a picture of the QR code synced to his private key, or “seed phrase,” quietly gaining full access to his assets. To stall Nicholas, the scammers calmly assured him that the royalty payments were arriving, all while frantically transferring his NFTs away. When his suspicions finally blew over, it was already far too late. The damage totaled about 150 ETH, or roughly $480,000. Soon after he was scammed, he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_jeffnicholas_/status/1430067809321590788"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; out a single word: “Fuck.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1xc40"&gt;As the value of NFTs have increased overall, with certain projects being considered “blue chip” due to high or relatively stable valuations, so too has the threat of scammers. In the NFT space, the word “scam” covers many bases. It can refer to a project whose team &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/fame-lady-squad-nft-women-men-scandal-scam"&gt;rakes in millions off false&lt;/a&gt; promises to buyers, also known as a “rug pull”; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keeganft/status/1436647583368187915?s=20"&gt;fake Twitter giveaways&lt;/a&gt; of NFTs that farm retweets and followers to give the illusion of clout; and malicious links or persuasive impostors that result in the user unknowingly giving up their private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSPFjq"&gt;It seems almost paradoxical that a space whose users are generally fluent in traditional cybersecurity can become victims so easily. But in the NFT space, where a culture of community, vibes, and clicking fast on good deals rule, it is the socially-minded scams that are the most compelling. Scammers, whose ploys all depend on gaining a victim’s trust, exploit the same instincts that make the NFT space more a tight-knit community of friends than an assemblage of individual traders. In this climate, Nicholas calls these scams a kind of “social engineering:” conditioning someone to think they are dealing with a friend or trusted community member so that they let their guard down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="SFRSHq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It takes focus to be like, ‘I am my own bank, and I am the custodian of my own money.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGpI0L"&gt;The scam used on Nicholas is arguably the most nefarious. If a scammer has control of a user’s keys, they are able to transfer any crypto asset into a separate wallet. All transactions are irreversible by design. If a user immediately realizes their wallet has been compromised, it’s a frenzied race to transfer the most valuable assets into an uncompromised one. In Nicholas’ case, even though he had secured his account with an additional layer of protection — a hardware device that requires him to sign off on transactions — he had been manipulated into thinking he was authorizing royalty payments, and his NFTs quickly vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi2155"&gt;Because a blockchain like Ethereum is decentralized and allows for anonymity, it is difficult to track down scammers who use anonymous wallets, and victims have few avenues for recourse. “It takes focus to be like, ‘I am my own bank, and I am the custodian of my own money,’” Nicholas said. “I can’t just go through it like when I go to the bank and I’m distracted on my phone. You have to be 100 percent in the moment. Otherwise it’s very easy to miss some signs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbONV2"&gt;On the other hand, the blockchain is transparent: every transaction can be tracked, whether or not the destination is anonymous. In the recent case where community cybersleuths discovered that an OpenSea employee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;traded NFTs on insider information&lt;/a&gt;, the unsettling transactions connected back to the employee’s publicly known account; in Nicholas’ case, the scammers’ wallets and the stolen assets remained fully visible, but could reveal nothing about the new owner’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9NNw3V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The NFT community has begun to develop a scam-response playbook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMbXOg"&gt;This meant that while the scammers themselves eluded identification, OpenSea could still identify the scammer’s wallet address. Upon being informed, they were obligated to “lock” the stolen NFTs, preventing them from being traded or resold. But by the time they locked Nicholas’ assets, the scammers had preemptively sold them off to the highest bidders, none of whom knew they were participating in the exchange of stolen goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKYZhR"&gt;This put Nicholas into a double bind. Despite the crushing blow of losing six figures of assets, which included the Bored Ape he used as his Twitter identity, he had to, as he says, “make buyers whole” since they had collectively spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on NFTs that were suddenly unsellable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EunQj5"&gt;The NFT community has begun to develop a playbook to deal with the fallout from scams, which involves raising funds to buy back stolen and flipped goods. This typically includes community fundraising, where generous users donate excess Ethereum or in-demand NFTs, while artists often pitch in with NFTs they’ve created themselves. Oftentimes, victims are given zero-interest cryptocurrency loans, which they can use to invest or start their own artistic projects to get back on their feet. Rescue bots with names like “Cool Cats Rescue” and “dogemaster42069” patrol the marketplace, making automatic lowball offers to liquidity-starved scammers so the NFTs can be returned to the original owners at fairer prices — and sometimes for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CoolCatRescue/status/1421205215408177156?s=20"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bB9xdW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My stolen items ended up in innocent buyers’ wallets and are now locked.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gla6s9"&gt;Nicholas connected with Sohrob Farudi, an NFT collector &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sohrobf/status/1430478533306982408?s=20"&gt;who’d lost&lt;/a&gt; what he estimated was 250 ETH, or $800,000, after scammers had deceived him by impersonating the Bored Ape Yacht Club founders. Together they started a community fund to buy back the stolen NFTs that had been frozen. By raising NFTs from the community, they were able to resell the donations for roughly 10 percent of the value of the stolen assets, or a still-impressive sum of 32 ETH. The rest has come out of their own pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stxwGZ"&gt;“I felt horrible that something that happened to me impacted all these other people. It isn’t fair that my stolen items ended up in innocent buyers’ wallets and are now locked,” Farudi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkvw2R"&gt;While the fund has reunited Nicholas and Farudi with some of their prized assets, the process has not all been easy. Soon after the scammers sold the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the perceived market value skyrocketed on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664469/bored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount"&gt;a Sotheby’s auction announcement&lt;/a&gt; and an expansion of the Bored Ape ecosystem called “Mutants.” While most buyers returned the NFTs at cost, some ape buyers were not willing to return their inflated NFTs for what they paid. After significant negotiation, Nicholas and Farudi were able to settle with the large majority of the buyers. One ape remains. “We may have to just let it go,” Nicholas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rF78PP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OpenSea has since added an SOS button&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3GA5Ai"&gt;Despite the stereotype of a cryptocurrency space subject to highly-complicated hacks, such as when an anonymous hacker &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/08/10/more-than-600-million-stolen-in-ethereum-and-other-cryptocurrencies-marking-one-of-cryptos-biggest-hacks-ever/?sh=535b8bd87f62"&gt;stole&lt;/a&gt; over $600 million in cryptocurrency (and later returned &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/poly-network-hacker-returns-remaining-cryptocurrency.html"&gt;all of it&lt;/a&gt;), the scams used on Nicholas and Farudi were verifiably low-tech. There was no venomous code; it was fake Discord channels and fake names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc4jMN"&gt;In response to the two high-profile scams, OpenSea has apologized to Nicholas and Farudi. The platform also added an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain/status/1435226364681011203?s=20"&gt;SOS button&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to lock their own account should they believe it to be compromised. MetaMask, the wallet service Nicholas used, has temporarily &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain/status/1430607237165223940?s=20"&gt;disabled&lt;/a&gt; the QR code which gives access to a user’s keys, since scammers have exploited the feature through victims’ screen share function on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ColeThereum/status/1430564716410286081?s=20"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; occasions. While Discord has some security features to prevent impersonation, such as unique four-digit number tags on top of a non-unique username system, some users feel that the latter still enables opportunities for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3YFjH"&gt;For Nicholas and Farudi, their lives were upended in a matter of hours. Nicholas compared the feeling to PTSD, and Farudi says the psychological trauma has made him paranoid whenever he clicks on his MetaMask. If anything could have brought them back into the space, it was the social connections that drew them in the first place. “It’s a story centered in community. This bad thing happened and the community rallied,” Nicholas told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There are so many people who have reached out and said, ‘Look, the same thing happened to me. And I’ve been ashamed, and I haven’t said anything. And I didn’t do anything about it because I know better.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tSoAoc"&gt;“If this is what it took to close a vulnerability, and now other people won’t suffer the same fate,” Farudi added, “I feel good that we went out and did what we did.”&lt;/p&gt;
