    <title>Get an unlocked Google Pixel 3 for $160 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFj59s7JBVL0bYJjCB6kT3SYJbI=/0x0:1720x1147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283574/Google_Pixel_3_Front_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fv8hjQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Google Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; was one of the best Android phones of 2018, and though it might not be the showstopper it once was, it’s a standout if you can find it for the right price. Thankfully, if you’re looking to upgrade or take the plunge into the Android ecosystem, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=UnlockedGooglePixel3Woot051321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3-64gb-unlocked%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_el" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is currently offering&lt;/a&gt; a 64GB, unlocked version of the Pixel 3 for $160 — a discount of $240.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvEh6q"&gt;Despite its age, the Pixel 3 remains more than capable with its Snapdragon 845 processor. The phone lacks a headphone jack and its bezels aren’t exactly small, but it packs a 5.5-inch OLED display and a terrific 12-megapixel rear camera, one capable of capturing vibrant shots and decent low-light photos. The Pixel 3’s dual front-facing cameras even churn out wide-angle selfies, while its support for wireless charging makes it one of the cheapest phones outside of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22425011/zte-blade-11-prime-review-price-specs-screen"&gt;ZTE Blade 11 Prime&lt;/a&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N2Vpz4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu6NGw"&gt;Right now, Woot is selling the pink Verizon model, however, it’s compatible with most other US carriers, including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;despite Google discontinuing the Pixel 3 in March&lt;/a&gt;, the phone will continue to receive software updates — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — through October 2021. If you’re looking for a budget phone and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still outside your price range, it’s hard to go wrong with the Google Pixel 3.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s return to theaters will include a shorter 45-day theatrical window</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wa5t3Xw0gnJmL5AFr6m1smH-l2g=/192x0:833x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283539/Screenshot_1160_1024x427.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eh12Rv"&gt;Disney has confirmed that its upcoming releases &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; will be the company’s first two films to debut exclusively in theaters (on August 13th and September 3rd, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev4ZCj"&gt;But when they do hit theaters, it’ll be for a far shorter amount of time, with just 45 days of theatrical exclusivity, instead of the traditional 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vr9c6x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shorter windows are the new standard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KosEC"&gt;The studio is by no means the only one: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;Warner Bros. has already announced&lt;/a&gt; that its return to theaters in 2022 will feature a 45-day window; Paramount has said that upcoming blockbuster films like &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;will get 45-day windows&lt;/a&gt;, while smaller movies will have &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficepro.com/paramount-cuts-down-theatrical-exclusivity-for-major-titles-to-30-45-day-window/"&gt;an even shorter 30-day window&lt;/a&gt;. And Universal has signed deals with both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wall-street-is-reacting-to-cinemark-universal-theatrical-window-deal"&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt;: smaller movies (with openings less than $50 million domestically) can hit paid video services after a 17-day window, while bigger films (that open to bigger numbers) can hit paid video services after 31 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6YxoM"&gt;It’s a move that makes a lot of sense for all of these companies: even the biggest movies in the world tend to make the bulk of their money theatrically in the first few weekends, and the longer that films are kept exclusive to theaters, the longer companies like Disney and WarnerMedia have to wait before they can get them through the usual paid video windows and onto streaming services like Disney Plus and HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv18MT"&gt;And that’s really the name of the game now: release big blockbusters theatrically, cash in on those massive opening weekends, and then rush them to streaming where they can be used to help bolster a service’s library, attracting new subscribers and giving existing ones more reasons to stay subscribed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7xIHP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will make it easier to search your DMs, finally adds DM search to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3OvFtCaTXrjYMHffJRuCCEXk1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283494/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TcgMK"&gt;Can you imagine being able to actually &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; Twitter to find a conversation, instead of just scrolling through endlessly to hopefully find what you’re looking for? That could be a reality for Twitter DMs in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HamauA"&gt;First off, the company’s finally &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1392924451705024512"&gt;bringing a DM search bar to Android today&lt;/a&gt;, nearly two years after it first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893603/twitter-dm-search-launch-apple-iphone-ios-text"&gt;appeared on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly, it’s going to drastically expand how helpful that bar is by surfacing older conversations and even actual words you’ve typed in those conversations sometime “later this year.” (Currently, you can only search for the names of the people you’ve spoken to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQs4u5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve brought the DM search bar to Android and are rolling out an improved version that lets you search for all of your old convos, not just the most recent ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waiting for the option to search your DMs for message content? We’re working on releasing that later this year! &lt;a href="https://t.co/wAQxSokJt6"&gt;https://t.co/wAQxSokJt6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1392924451705024512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vS5M2K"&gt;Frankly, I’ve rarely ever bothered to try Twitter search on mobile, since I’ve largely been an Android guy — and because Twitter’s mobile search doesn’t give you anywhere near the power of Tweetdeck or Twitter’s advanced search on desktop web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqFdTU"&gt;Speaking of which, here’s an easy way to find your own tweets: drop https://twitter.com/search?q=&lt;strong&gt;YOURSEARCHQUERY&lt;/strong&gt;%20(from%3A&lt;strong&gt;YOURTWITTERNAME&lt;/strong&gt;)&amp;amp;src=typed_query in your web browser, and see what you get. That’d be a nice feature on mobile, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feds break up alleged streaming password theft scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzFn3NCLI3QB3V0K7Ym0yE28-YM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283343/acastro_180109_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UpWq7G"&gt;An Oregon man who authorities say stole and resold customers’ credentials for Netflix and other streaming services has been indicted on fraud charges, the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/beaverton-man-indicted-streaming-service-fraud-scheme"&gt;US Attorney’s office announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXiGk7"&gt;According to the indictment, Samuel Joyner and Evan McMahon stole and sold more than 200,000 customer account credentials — for streaming services including Netflix, HBO Max, and Spotify Premium — as part of the operation of an online service called AccountBot. Users of the site paid a subscription fee to obtain others’ credentials for paid streaming services at a lower rate than the services charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ESlfe"&gt;As of March 2019, the service allegedly had some 52,000 customers and offered more than 217,000 stolen streaming account credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDLCF9"&gt;AccountBot allegedly obtained those credentials through hacking. The indictment alleges that the two men used credential stuffing attacks — essentially taking login details from public breaches and reusing the information on other sites. Such attacks often work because people reuse the same passwords and usernames on many sites. Joyner and McMahon used an automated tool to verify the stolen credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E1VJw"&gt;AccountBot customers paid between $1.79 and $24.99 for access to the stolen credentials, depending on how long and which service they wanted to access. The DOJ says McMahon managed payments and coded the AccountBot website, while Joyner acquired the stolen credentials and handled AccountBot customer service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOlNqg"&gt;Netflix and other streaming services have &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/the-black-market-for-netflix-accounts/462321/"&gt;dealt with a variety of password-stealing schemes&lt;/a&gt; and other scams for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325831/netflix-password-sharing-test-feature-piracy-security-streaming-video"&gt;Netflix announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; it was trying to crack down on password-sharing among its customers; even if you’re only sharing account access with people you know, the more people who have the info, the greater the chances that info could be compromised. According to analysis from research firm Parks Associates, password piracy and sharing &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/01/13/password-sharing-denies-streaming-services-9-billion-in-fees-report/"&gt;cost streaming services&lt;/a&gt; like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus $9 billion a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqGgFr"&gt;McMahon was prosecuted for similar offenses in the District Court of New South Wales in Sydney, according to the DOJ, and last month was sentenced to two years and two months by way of &lt;a href="https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/intensive_correction_orders.html"&gt;intensive corrections order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCGP5U"&gt;Joyner is charged with conspiracy to commit computer and access device fraud, trafficking and use of unauthorized access devices, and possession of more than 15 unauthorized access devices. He was arrested Wednesday by the FBI and pleaded not guilty at an arraignment before a US magistrate judge. He’s scheduled to stand trial on the charges July 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ir04O"&gt;The charges of conspiracy to commit computer and access device fraud carry a max sentence of five years in federal prison. Trafficking and use of unauthorized access devices and possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices are each punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>From Texas to Hawaii: SpaceX plans first orbital Starship test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOFVc3Yx4o722XDL2orWyGXvW4w=/157x0:1837x1120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69283259/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_4.20.02_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omFyRY"&gt;SpaceX plans to have its first Starship test flight to orbit launch from Texas and splash down off the coast of an island in Hawaii, according to a document the company filed with the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday. The orbital flight test would mark the first time SpaceX stacks both elements of its massive Starship system together, the next key development step in its attempt to build a rocket that could one day land on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPi0W6"&gt;As outlined in the &lt;a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=273481&amp;amp;x="&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, a super heavy booster stage will launch Starship from SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas, facilities and separate in midair nearly three minutes into flight. About five minutes later,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that booster stage will return back to Earth and splash down in the Gulf of Mexico — or as SpaceX puts it: it will “perform a partial return and land in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 20 miles from the shore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9H97E"&gt;Meanwhile, Starship (the top half of the entire rocket system) will continue into orbit, nearly completing a full trip around Earth before plunging back through the atmosphere over Hawaii roughly 90 minutes after launching from Texas. Starship will aim to nail a “powered, targeted landing” on the ocean about 62 miles off the northwest coast of Kauai, the state’s northernmost island.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/grdpuhr9PuJkfVVgYuHfhSaW7ps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512981/May_13_2021_17_04_07.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A Starship prototype in March carries out its complex landing-flip maneuver before attempting to land — a technique similar to how it would land off the coast of Hawaii.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ELJrxt"&gt;The document didn’t name a specific date for Starship’s orbital flight. CEO Elon Musk and SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell have said it could happen by the end of 2021, but an email that accompanied Thursday’s filing indicated it could happen any time in the next year, before March 1st, 2022. That email also says the maximum altitude for Starship is 72 miles — an extremely low orbital altitude sitting just north of the boundary between space and Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqOop2"&gt;SpaceX’s Starship system is the centerpiece of Musk’s goal to enable routine interplanetary travel. The system, designed to send humans and up to 100 tons of cargo to the Moon and Mars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;recently won&lt;/a&gt; a $2.9 billion contract to serve as NASA’s first ride to the Moon carrying astronauts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;since 1972. SpaceX has launched five high-altitude Starship prototypes from its south Texas rocket facilities since December, nailing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421845/spacex-starship-sn15-successful-landing"&gt;successful landing on its fifth test flight&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. A few more of those suborbital “hop” tests are planned in the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Mde9y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“SpaceX intends to collect as much data as possible during flight”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z1pUtC"&gt;Whenever it happens, the orbital test will demonstrate Starship maneuvers that can’t be simulated using computers, SpaceX says in the document. “SpaceX intends to collect as much data as possible during flight to quantify entry dynamics and better understand what the vehicle experiences in a flight regime that is extremely difficult to accurately predict or replicate computationally.” The flight data gleaned from Starship’s test “will anchor any changes in vehicle design... and build better models for us to use in our internal simulations,” SpaceX said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkWv4Y"&gt;Musk has envisioned using Starship for rapid orbit-based transportation between any two cities on Earth, an ambitious (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16385026/elon-musk-spacex-rocket-transportation-point-to-point"&gt;pretty wild&lt;/a&gt;) idea called point-to-point travel. A Starship trip (Startrip?) between New York and London, for example, would take an hour. The 90-minute trip from Texas to Hawaii somewhat mirrors the idea, though it’s just a test, and it’s been a while since SpaceX or Musk have discussed any updates on point-to-point travel plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRI7jL"&gt;With its new Moon lander contract from NASA — which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;stirred quite&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;bit of FOMO&lt;/a&gt; in the space industry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;likely to NASA’s ire&lt;/a&gt; — SpaceX is racing to test Starship for deep-space missions with a deadline to put humans on the lunar surface by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="0KzKs9"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/12/homepod-still-available-for-purchase-two-months-after-being-discontinued/"&gt;been some buzz recently&lt;/a&gt; about how Apple is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-is-still-struggling-to-unload-its-launch-day-home-1846877912"&gt;having problems getting rid of its HomePods&lt;/a&gt;, with the now-discontinued Siri speakers still being on sale two months after Apple announced their discontinuation. And yet, the speakers are still $300, which is only slightly lower than their launch price of $350. Apple: it’s time to put them on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRsOh9"&gt;Here’s an anecdote to show how hard it’s been for Apple to unload these things: I bought a HomePod &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;the day its discontinuation was announced&lt;/a&gt;. An online tool tells me that it was made in October 2017, which was before Apple even started selling them in January 2018. That’s pretty rough, especially given that it’s a “space gray” one, seemingly the more popular of the two colors given that the white ones are &lt;em&gt;still available &lt;/em&gt;from Apple’s website. The same thing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DetroitBORG/status/1372259697135386631?s=20"&gt;also happened to tech YouTuber DetroitBORG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6D693TByx_m5JUHMgFu92XQHno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512738/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_12.43.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s so in stock I could have one delivered by the time this article goes up for less than $10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X4h05F"&gt;Listen, Apple. I know that selling these things off for $200, or even $150, would pretty much be admitting defeat, but these things are still in stock two months after they were discontinued. It’s a great speaker, but at $300, it just doesn’t make sense given its complete lack of inputs that aren’t powered by Siri or AirPlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grgtjw"&gt;Fire sales always get people excited: just today, a few of my colleagues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1392834164639031302?s=20"&gt;started pining for a Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;Microsoft slashed its price&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1392834606479642629?s=20"&gt;even though they’ve heard&lt;/a&gt; all about how painful it is to use). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/08/19/hp-drops-touchpad-price-stone-good-luck-snapping-buy-99"&gt;the famous HP Touchpad&lt;/a&gt;, a tablet which was flatly ignored until HP took the price from $399 to $99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lie0F"&gt;I most certainly don’t need another HomePod, but if there was one last hoorah sale that made it a reasonable price, I might forget that for a moment and buy one for my office. But Apple, please: it’s obvious you didn’t care enough for this speaker while it was alive. Just do something, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to finally close the loop. Put it on sale, “accidentally” include one with AirTag orders, whatever. Just let it go gently into that dark night, with no stock left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Italian authorities fine Google $120 million for   an Android Auto issue that’s already solved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSAqN2RP-P6Cn5FMzjnDU5sOo9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282775/akrales_190725_3567_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfg0Dw"&gt;The Italian Competition Authority (ICA) &lt;a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2021/5/A529"&gt;handed Google&lt;/a&gt; an approximately $120 million (€100 million) fine today for not letting a third-party charging app on Android Auto in 2019 (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/13/google-android-auto-fine-italy/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The case started with a probe into the search giant’s automotive software business, which &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/10/introducing-android-for-cars-app-library.html"&gt;until October 2020&lt;/a&gt; had limitations around what kinds of apps were allowed to be developed and released for use while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBvnS6"&gt;Enel Group, an Italian energy company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629912/google-android-auto-italy-antitrust-probe-enel-group"&gt;originally complained&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that Google wouldn’t allow its Enel X Recharge app on Android Auto. The app can help find charging locations for electric cars, a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17983986/google-maps-electric-car-charging-tesla-superchargers"&gt;Google first added to Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. Today’s ICA fine is focused on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enelx.com%2Fro%2Fen%2Felectric-mobility%2Fproducts%2Fprivates%2Fjuicepass-app&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22434373%2Fitalian-antitrust-fine-google-android-auto-enel-x-juicepass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Enel X JuicePass&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enelx.com%2Fit%2Fen%2Fnews-media%2Fnotizie%2F2019%2F07%2Fapp-enelx-juicepass-new-name-new-energy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22434373%2Fitalian-antitrust-fine-google-android-auto-enel-x-juicepass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the renamed version&lt;/a&gt; of the same app with the same EV features. Along with the fine, the ICA is ordering Google to open up Android Auto to more developers (something the company has already done) and let Enel Group onto the platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lV81Ml"&gt;The Authority has therefore ordered Google to make available to Enel X Italia, as well as to other app developers, tools for the programming of apps that are interoperable with Android Auto and will monitor the effective and correct implementation of the imposed obligations through an independent expert to whom Google must provide all cooperation and information requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe44Ug"&gt;Before changing what apps it allows, Google required Android Auto apps to include some kind of messaging or media playback option, and limited navigation to Waze and Google Maps. Since the company changed course, similar charging apps to JuicePass, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409310/chargepoint-android-auto-electric-vehicle-charging-network"&gt;like ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;, have launched on the platform, seemingly without any issues. Since the ICA began its investigation before Google eased up its restrictions, there’s a possibility Enel’s complaints helped motivate the change in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sqqyU"&gt;For its part, Google says it disagrees with the ICA’s decision and provided this statement in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ro12BR"&gt;The number one priority for Android Auto is to ensure apps can be used safely while driving. That’s why we have strict guidelines on the types of apps which are currently supported and these are based on driver-distraction tests and regulatory and industry standards. Thousands of applications are already compatible with Android Auto, and our goal is to allow even more developers to make their apps available over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sMDVkE"&gt;The company also says that Enel is able to integrate its app into Android Auto using one of the &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/04/start-your-engines-launch-new-android.html"&gt;navigation or booking templates&lt;/a&gt; it already provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2BFd"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150166/android-auto-expands-countries-europe-africa-asia"&gt;Android Auto becomes more common&lt;/a&gt; and Google develops direct relationships with European automakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;like Volvo for Android Automotive&lt;/a&gt;, the concern that the company wields too much control over its platform isn’t ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Renewable energy won’t make Elon Musk love bitcoin again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla And Bitcoin Stock Pictures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35O-AIPDvnT_ctmHdreebLFvDZM=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282442/1231424737.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GuAl4W"&gt;Elon Musk shouldn’t hold his breath waiting for bitcoin to become environmentally friendly enough for Tesla to take it as payment. Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that Tesla was walking away from the cryptocurrency because of the fossil fuels used for bitcoin mining and transactions. In the announcement, he left the door open for Tesla to accept bitcoin again if mining the cryptocurrency eventually runs on “more sustainable energy.” But some experts caution that renewable energy is not a silver bullet for bitcoin’s sustainability problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dP7Cl6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla &amp;amp; Bitcoin &lt;a href="https://t.co/YSswJmVZhP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8w3gz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Alex de Vries, a digital currency economist who has consistently called out bitcoin’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. He runs the blog &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digiconomist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps a running tab on bitcoin’s estimated energy use and emissions. While some other &lt;a href="https://www.coincenter.org/estimating-bitcoin-electricity-use-a-beginners-guide/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373524/cryptocurrency-climate-accord-bitcoin-carbon-footprint"&gt;blockchain enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt; have been more optimistic about the potential for renewable energy to slash bitcoin’s emissions, de Vries has &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30087-X"&gt;published papers&lt;/a&gt; arguing that the climate calculations just don’t add up. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with de Vries about why he’s still skeptical about bitcoin going green through renewables, other ways the cryptocurrency could cut its pollution, and how bitcoin compares to alternatives like Dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Q87I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVO7g0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have any reaction to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;news in February&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that Tesla was going to accept bitcoin for payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTgJMw"&gt;I was shocked at the time because bitcoin isn’t an ESG-friendly currency. We know that a big part of the mining is done by using Chinese coal; that’s something that isn’t new information. Mining itself is a really big lottery where the machines that are participating are just generating useless computations all the time so they’re literally wasting resources for making new blocks for this blockchain. It’s really weird that a company that has a mission statement that involves decarbonizing the planet gets involved with a currency that ultimately involves the waste of natural resources, specifically fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xJn0Ne"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was shocked at the time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVoCkz"&gt;The bitcoin network is responsible for 55 million metric tons of CO2 annually, which is as much as a nation like Singapore. Ironically, it’s also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digieconomist/status/1389521169657868288?s=21"&gt;more than the entire estimated net gains from deploying electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUuzNj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your reaction to yesterday’s news that Elon decided to backtrack on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvH4Os"&gt;Well, my initial response was better late than never. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rx4f4"&gt;In his statement, Elon Musk says that they’re doing this because of an increasing amount of fossil fuels used for bitcoin mining. Now in all honesty, there hasn’t been that much change. Let’s be real, Tesla announced that it would accept bitcoin two months ago, and not that much has changed since then. The total amount of resources going into the network has gone up by a bit, but we already knew that was primarily Chinese coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7G1jk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting that Musk says Tesla will go back to bitcoin “as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.” Do you think that can happen? Why or why not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd85Lc"&gt;In all honesty, it makes no sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P77109"&gt;In the past few years, miners have only been getting renewables from the south of China, that has been their only major source of renewables. And it doesn’t last. It lasts for only four months a year and because the production is seasonal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uFFjYz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In all honesty, it makes no sense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGtDj7"&gt;That’s the problem with renewable energy sources in general: they can’t provide these machines with 24/7 power all year long. For example, it was recently argued that &lt;a href="https://github.com/ARKInvest/SolarBatteryBitcoin"&gt;miners could be using solar power&lt;/a&gt; for bitcoin mining, which sounds like a great idea. But if you read what should happen to do that, bitcoin miners would need to be shut down during half the day in order to make that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6x9ji"&gt;That makes no sense if you’re an investor in these machines, because you’re paying a whole lot of money for a device that the moment you get, it starts becoming obsolete. If you miss out on half a day, you’re missing out on a level of income that’s just never going to come back. You want to have these machines running 24/7 if you want to maximize your profit, which is a lot easier if you’re running on Chinese coal than if you’re running on solar power for half a day — so there’s no real incentive to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUH2vS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You published a paper that argued that renewable energy will not solve bitcoin’s sustainability problem — can you walk me through why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjHCt4"&gt;A big amount of bitcoin miners can always cause problems no matter what type of energy they’re using. It can lead to outages if mining becomes really popular in the particular spot. What also might be happening is that you’re using renewable energy that you could have used a different way to clean up the grid elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMJjUV"&gt;Even if, hypothetically speaking, this whole network was running on renewable energy. Still, it doesn’t solve the sustainability issues of bitcoin. Bitcoin uses excessive amounts of hardware. You have a bunch of specialized equipment that can only do bitcoin mining. The moment they become unprofitable, there’s nothing you can do with them. You can’t repurpose them, you can’t use them as a home computer. It’s trash. And they don’t last very long, on average maybe one and a half years. So you’ve got millions of devices that are becoming obsolete extremely fast. That just results in a big pile of electronic waste down the line. It’s already the case that a single bitcoin transaction is equivalent to throwing away an iPhone 12 mini in terms of materials, that’s already how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lqJaE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there better solutions to bitcoin’s sustainability problem? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUYCEB"&gt;The good thing is that Elon Musk did mention the alternative cryptocurrencies that don’t have the same environmental impact. This is a very important point because the energy consumption issue in bitcoin relates to the proof of work algorithm. That is a specific part of the bitcoin software that is not necessarily present in alternative cryptocurrencies because there’s different ways to do the block creation process. In bitcoin, it depends on computational power, but there are alternatives. Proof of stake is the most popular one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pus0uh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cryptocurrencies that don’t have the same environmental impact&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="duZu1x"&gt;The second largest cryptocurrency of the moment, Ethereum, is right now running proof of work but is planning to change that to proof of stake. What that does is it makes the block creation process depend on wealth, rather than computational power, so there’s no incentive to have energy-hungry specialized hardware. That fixes both the energy need, as well as the hardware need. If you have something running on proof of stake, it wouldn’t even be 0.1 percent of the energy needed to run bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjE85M"&gt;If Ethereum can turn to proof of stake, theoretically, so can bitcoin, which would actually fix the environmental issues. But so far there has been no move inside the community to make such things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bT1x4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk has also talked up Dogecoin in the past. How does Dogecoin compare to bitcoin? Do you see it becoming as bad for the climate as bitcoin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLPFwe"&gt;The thing is, if something runs on proof of work, which is the case in Dogecoin, then it’s just as bad as bitcoin. The impact that Dogecoin has currently is a lot smaller than bitcoin, but that’s because the value of Dogecoin is a lot less and these things are directly related with each other. That’s kind of been the essence of my work over the past few years. There is a direct relationship between the value of these assets, how much money is being earned by the miners, and how much they’re spending on electricity. Very simply said, the more valuable an asset, the more money will be made by miners, the more they will spend on resources like hardware and energy. So, the fact that Dogecoin has a smaller impact than bitcoin is just because the value is a lot less, but if they were the same size, the impact would be equally bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xge3lH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just as bad as bitcoin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oPVeXG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve already started to see the value of bitcoin drop after Musk’s announcement. Are we starting to see emissions or energy use fall as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4S7wb"&gt;No. The price has gone down by maybe 15 percent. That does reduce the potential future emissions of the network. But it doesn’t reduce today’s emissions because, right now, bitcoin mining is extremely profitable. As it stands, the network’s impact will still continue to increase, unless the price goes down by a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBOJgE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much more would it take to see a decline in emissions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYzIIg"&gt;I wrote about that in a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349952553_Bitcoin_Boom_What_Rising_Prices_Mean_for_the_Network's_Energy_Consumption"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; recently. The current price is still around $50,000 per coin today, although I haven’t checked it for the past hour. Below $30,000, that’s where the current energy consumption would start to go down, so it has a long way to go. That’s kind of the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccinated people can ditch masks and social distancing in most places, CDC says </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman receives her Covid-19 vaccination at a vaccination..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLGBCtWXZsTVRlpugaQn30J0eDw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282332/1232851574.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9qF7b"&gt;People who are fully vaccinated can shed their masks and gather indoors or outdoors without worrying about social distancing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTBiPw"&gt;“If you were fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. We have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a press conference today.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIjtsr"&gt;People are considered to be fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving their final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtkYhb"&gt;There are a few caveats. Vaccinated people who are immunocompromised should talk to their doctor before getting rid of their masks, Walensky said. Certain settings will still require a mask, including health care settings, public transit, and on planes or trains. And if someone develops symptoms, they should mask back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOpKdb"&gt;She also cautioned that if the situation with the pandemic gets worse in the US, the guidance might change, too — if there is a spike in cases or a new outbreak, masks and social distancing measures may return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uCb33"&gt;The new announcement is a shift from just a few weeks ago when the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405869/covid-vaccine-mask-guidelines-cdc"&gt;relaxed its masking recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for fully vaccinated people in some situations, mostly outdoors. At the time, it continued to encourage people to wear masks during most indoor activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ0wIR"&gt;In the two weeks since the CDC’s last update, Walensky noted that cases in the US have dropped by a third, and more people are now eligible for a vaccine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As of this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22395472/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kid-ages-12-15-fda-authorization"&gt;vaccines are authorized for people 12 years and older&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4gSlB"&gt;Walensky also emphasized that additional data has shown that vaccines are effective in the general population and against variants. Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;repeatedly shown&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines not only protect people from the virus that causes COVID-19, but that vaccinated people are unlikely to pass it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqqt85"&gt;Officials also emphasized that if people want to continue wearing masks in public, they can. “We know the risk is extremely low of getting infected If you’re vaccinated, whether you’re indoors or outdoors. But there are those people who don’t want to take that bit of a risk, and there’s nothing wrong with that and they shouldn’t be criticized,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xntHpv"&gt;“People have to make these decisions based on their own comfort,” Walensky agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCFLPt"&gt;Currently, more than 46 percent percent of adults in the United States are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lGDKd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: HP Spectre x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17 (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a brilliant gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly is a great business laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU9ktC"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zaTcIA"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best 17-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;
