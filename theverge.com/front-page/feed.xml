    <title>DJI Mini 2 drone getting firmware update to address battery charging issue</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qoddNw"&gt;Dronemaker DJI says a firmware update is coming to fix a battery discharge issue in its DJI Mini 2 drone. &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/dji-admits-dji-mini-2-has-battery-issue-and-says-a-fix-is-coming"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company says the update will “initiate auto-discharge when batteries are in the drone or charging hub and have not been used recently.” It’s a relatively minor issue that mainly affects the battery’s longevity; lithium polymer batteries like the one in the DJI Mini 2 have a longer lifespan if they can discharge slowly when left at a full charge for a long period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkoKOK"&gt;Unlike its Intelligent Flight Batteries, the batteries in the DJI Mini 2 “use a minute amount of charge to maintain vital functions and do not initiate auto-discharge,” the company told &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;. DJI recommends that batteries in the DJI Mini 2 be removed from the drone or charging hub — regardless of whether the drone has received the firmware update — if the drone will be idle for a while. The timing of the firmware update is still to be determined; we’ve reached out to DJI for more details and will update when we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6kao4"&gt;The DJI Mini 2 was released in November 2020, and our reviewer called it the best drone under $500, with a decent camera that helps make it “a perfect package for a content creator on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G4’s newest host is virtual streamer CodeMiko</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WCaIDI7j5vwjDoLJyG-RwPrHRno=/21x0:2340x1546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227911/Miko_Headshot_Full__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3TMgMo"&gt;G4’s newest host looks a little different from the rest of its lineup: it’s hired CodeMiko — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22370260/codemiko-twitch-interview-stream-technician"&gt;one of the biggest virtual streamers on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; — to bring her eccentric interviews to the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTUmRK"&gt;CodeMiko, unlike the typical G4 host, is not human — or at least, not entirely. CodeMiko is a Vtuber (“virtual YouTuber,” though they’re often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408078/netflix-vtuber-anime-n-ko-youtube"&gt;found elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;), who uses motion capture tech to broadcast herself as a 3D character who can change her appearance on a whim. Since getting started about a year ago, CodeMiko has blown up, with more than 680,000 followers on Twitch and an average audience of more than 6,000 viewers at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xDAsSk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Chatting with CodeMiko, Twitch’s newest virtual talk show star","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22370260/codemiko-twitch-interview-stream-technician"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z6mdKw"&gt;On G4, CodeMiko will be interviewing “some of the most notable names in gaming and entertainment” and chatting with other network hosts, including Kevin Pereira and Adam Sessler. “CodeMiko will bring her revolutionary interview experience to G4 and help the network push the boundaries of gaming entertainment,” Kevin Sabbe, G4’s head of content, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgQh80"&gt;If you haven’t seen CodeMiko’s interviews, you should check them out. They’re oddly aggressive and often take advantage of her virtual nature to put CodeMiko into different outfits and environments to match the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x8UgZC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yLCqlk"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I'm joining in in my own strange way, here's my feet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vtuber%E3%81%AE%E9%9D%B4%E3%81%8C%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Vtuberの靴が見たい&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YOPlkwAiQc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YOPlkwAiQc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miko (@thecodemiko) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecodemiko/status/1371608624976437248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLTXga"&gt;As you might imagine, she’s also walked the line of what’s acceptable on Twitch and has already been banned a couple of times. Hosting on G4 (off of Twitch, at least) could give CodeMiko a way to maintain her wilder material without the constant fear of a ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmlCuP"&gt;G4 plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22254953/g4b4-revival-twitch-youtube-attack-of-the-show-x-play"&gt;relaunch later this year&lt;/a&gt;. The network shut down in 2014, but it’s now being revived by a Comcast-owned gaming brand. For the moment, the network exists on YouTube and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the accessories you’ll need for your PlayStation 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKR_P301-r_RAX5aYlCy2lUGo0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67755669/vpavic_4278_20201030_0345.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8EKGm6"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21314187"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is still incredibly difficult to find. Whether you got lucky with a launch unit, or are still trying to snag one for yourself, picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand new console (whenever you get one) isn’t a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvceaC"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one DualSense controller. Unlike the DualShock controllers, the DualSense has a two-color scheme and a more ergonomic design. The controller also features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, and haptic feedback, with some games taking advantage of the controller’s features to provide more immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZ6VYl"&gt;In addition to working with the PS5, the DualSense can connect to Android and iOS devices wirelessly. The controller will also connect wirelessly to a PC if your computer supports Bluetooth. If not, you can connect the DualSense to a PC using a USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6AKJDv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Get the best price on a subscription to PS Plus right here","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348957/best-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/baxSt-AgeiT2dmO0HH0MHNVDjLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015299/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s DualSense controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9EdKyu"&gt;The controller is usually $70, but sometimes you can find it for $60. The DualSense is a good successor to the PS4’s controller, given all the improvements that come with it. If you already owned a PS4 or own a DualShock 4, you can still use the controller on the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352382/sony-ps5-playstation-4-controllers-new-ps4-support-games"&gt;but it will only work while playing PS4 games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3xDOS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOnGkH"&gt;Looking for a new 4K TV that can take full advantage of the PS5’s capabilities? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch has you covered with a range of TVs from TCL, LG, and Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. They’re all different sizes and prices, but working well with the PS5 is something they each have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FslBNnGNynU4jLrAtku1DjZfL44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20030776/Screen_Shot_2020_06_11_at_5.28.58_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZGE2U"&gt;If you are interested in using your PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast your gameplay with friends, you’ll want to pick up the PS5 HD Camera, which is $60. It includes dual 1080p lenses and is a successor to the PS4 camera. The camera also allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UH1Lgq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JP9QkN"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D wireless gaming headset is worth the $100 price tag if you want a wireless model that can let the audio in some PS5-exclusive games shine. It sounds fantastic in games like &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and more. Like the console, this headset has been a little tough to find, but it’s coming back in stock more frequently these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4VdxYT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="mBEDB8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are some other great wired and wireless headset recommendations","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opFmXFF_qtR-LDnVobxe4mPdHjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21979441/blog_playstation_com_PS5_Media_Remote_featured_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 media remote includes four dedicated launch buttons for Disney Plus, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cS7G5C"&gt;Shifting back to accessories, the PS5 also has its own media remote. The PS5 can double as a device to stream movies and videos, or if you buy the PS5 with a disc drive, you can watch Blu-ray discs. The PS5 will have a ton of streaming apps available at launch, including Apple TV Plus, Crunchyroll, and Hulu, so if you plan to watch movies and shows on your device, the PS5 media remote would be a smart thing to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rkTa1q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562948" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uClkY4"&gt;With the console’s SSD space limited and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551165/sony-ps5-playstation-5-no-m2-ssd-expansion-launch"&gt;no signs of SSD expansion support&lt;/a&gt; coming in the near future, using an external hard drive as a way to store older PS4 games is not a bad idea. Just note that you won’t be able to use it to play next-gen PS5 titles, though a recent update allows you to store them on a hard drive like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="izStMf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ycg0i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 3rd, 11:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a link to Chris Welch’s guide to buying the best 4K TV for the PS5, as well as links for the Pulse 3D headset and a resource to help you find the best deal on a PS Plus subscription.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Upgrades to the US Army’s night vision technology make darkness into a video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0e_GHDGriMcZsgDmOtayPUgZhZU=/191x0:2689x1665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227888/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_11.00.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new tech improves contrast.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lancer Brigade&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y47Gh0"&gt;The US Army’s Lancer Brigade showed footage of the world as seen through the latest in night vision technology, and it’s a major improvement on the familiar blurry green visuals. By swapping the standard green tubes for white (along with other tweaks), the new Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars (ENVG-B) clearly show people and objects outlined in a glowing light, almost like a video game objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IaMB5D"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New Equipment!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars continue the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USArmy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@USArmy&lt;/a&gt;’s effort to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/modernize?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#modernize&lt;/a&gt; our fighting force!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have never seen night vision like this! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/readynow?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#readynow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/QuietProfessionals?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#QuietProfessionals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3TCPtnno1r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3TCPtnno1r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lancer Brigade (@lancer_brigade) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lancer_brigade/status/1385318416106475522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m1SG6n"&gt;Night vision technology was first developed in the 1930s to help military forces see during low-light conditions. The standard tech people think of around night vision uses a strategy called image enhancement, and it &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ask-smithsonian-how-does-night-vision-work-180956656/"&gt;works similarly&lt;/a&gt; to old televisions and computers. The device picks up any ambient light in an environment (like from the Moon) and passes it through a photocathode, a device that transforms photons (the light) into electrons. Those electrons then hit a tube covered in the fluorescent substance phosphor, creating the image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2mV7a"&gt;Usually, the tube contains green phosphor; the human eye is particularly sensitive to wavelengths of light in that color, and early &lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/31061/why-does-everything-look-green-through-night-vision-goggles"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that people could easily distinguish images that use it. But the new ENVG-B tech uses white phosphor tubes, which the Army’s Acquisition Support Center says offer &lt;a href="https://asc.army.mil/web/portfolio-item/enhanced-night-vision-goggle-envg-b/"&gt;better contrast&lt;/a&gt;. The result is a visual field that clearly outlines people, their equipment, and weapons, distinguishing them from the background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxhRvt"&gt;The new device also is designed as a set of binoculars to improve depth perception, and they integrate an augmented reality system. They can also let soldiers look through the scope of a weapon remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvKVV8"&gt;This type of night vision isn’t available to civilians, but like other military-grade tech, it could eventually trickle down for the general public. Night vision products are already marketed to hunters. The devices available are &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/night-vision-gear_n_59f38cf2e4b03cd20b8196bf"&gt;largely unregulated&lt;/a&gt;, despite concerns that they could be used for domestic terrorism or exported, where they may be national security threats. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The League of Legends animated series is coming to Netflix this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKFvomXkTTUo3Reyt1MwHcVNjiM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227718/Group_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDcwZ5"&gt;The long-awaited &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; animated series is coming to Netflix. The streaming service confirmed today that the show, called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, will be available later this fall. The show was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;first announced back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; 10th anniversary celebration event; last year, &lt;a href="https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;developer Riot announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; would be delayed to 2021 due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g0PjDb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The world of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LeagueofLegends&lt;/a&gt; is coming to Netflix.&lt;br&gt;Arcane drops this Fall. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7DJgqHpODM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7DJgqHpODM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1389218281706254336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klTlhZ"&gt;We still don’t know much about the show (you can get an all-too-brief taste in the teaser above), but it’s part of a big push from Riot to expand &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; beyond just the core strategy game. So far, that’s included comic books, a digital card game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;a mobile spinoff&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;an ancient board game&lt;/a&gt;. An animated series also makes sense given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;Riot’s long history with short cinematics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQ9fLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; also fits into Netflix’s recent strategy of tapping into the worlds of video games for new shows and movies. Outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;the blockbuster success of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s also a new season of &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; coming later this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252386/netflix-tomb-raider-kong-skull-island-anime"&gt;an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; anime&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s biggest rival, &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22346867/dota-dragons-blood-netflix-anime-review"&gt;has its own show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are some must-have accessories for your Xbox Series X or Series S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oDk3TIA9WbSACQAInKHXHTTfWXg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67755488/vpavic_4275_20201030_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hBZFYq"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; consoles launched in November 2020. Whether you were able to secure one in time for launch day, or if you’re still waiting for your moment of luck to get one, you might want some fresh accessories to snag with your big purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HI4qt"&gt;First up, controllers. You probably already know that Microsoft’s Xbox One wireless controller is also compatible with the new Series X / S consoles, which is great. However, the older controller model lacks a few features that might make the newer one a worthy upgrade for you. For instance, the revised controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, a USB-C port for charging up &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739518552736222032" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s optional $24.99 play-and-charge rechargeable battery&lt;/a&gt;, along with a few cosmetic and physical improvements to the d-pad and triggers. It’s not a completely new controller, like the PS5’s DualSense, but that comes through with its lower $59.99 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mefLS2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Get the best deal on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate right here.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348957/best-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOvMyoqUYxKCLfBJrV5_ap6qsC8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21904643/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3616_2_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VVeIFe"&gt;In addition to working with the Xbox consoles, the new controller also has Bluetooth support so you can easily connect it to your Android phone, iPhone, or PC. If your PC doesn’t have Bluetooth, you can pick up the Xbox wireless adapter made for Windows 10. &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows-10-black%2F6253924.p%3FskuId%3D6253924&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft sells the aforementioned PC adapter for $24.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9DMVNt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T3InI_Jx1ABKPuq9tgDd-BkhyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363682/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XtbFE9"&gt;If you need a headset, check out Microsoft’s own Xbox Wireless Headset that costs $100. In my review, I found it to be a comfortable, intuitively-designed headset that’s well worth its cost, if you can find it in stock. In addition to working well with Xbox consoles, it can connect to another device simultaneously via Bluetooth, so you don’t have a miss a call while you game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PEwWwc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="N8ARS8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TmgltLgt55niXEsBEL74voYG3r8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22012239/vpavic_201103_4275_0192.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can connect an external hard drive to the front USB port, or through either console’s rear USB ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qbrcds"&gt;Delegating your older games to slower, but far cheaper storage is a clever way to let you have all of your games accessible without crowding your already-limited SSD space. Though, it’s worth pointing out that any external USB drive will be significantly slower to load than what the Series X’s and Series S’s respective SSDs can handle. If you’re hungry for more info, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-xbox-series-x-back-compat-ssd-load-time-analysis" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out this in-depth look at different hard drive performance points&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Richard Leadbetter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="72J8Ar"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNWz-LZEXsjGoKuG7ZNxqXp5a5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21904657/twarren_xboxseriesexpansion_VLS_3588_2_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="izETtY"&gt;Of course, you can buy faster storage to add onto your Series X / S console, but it’ll cost you significantly more money than the option above. Microsoft partnered with Seagate to make proprietary 1TB SSDs that can be inserted into the rear of either console. These $220 SSDs are advertised to be &lt;em&gt;just as fast&lt;/em&gt; as the storage inside your new console, so this is the best place to keep all of the new games you want to quickly load and switch between at will. And, if you have the cash to burn, you can buy multiple 1TB cards and hot-swap them to access more games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FbTfF7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq-7QVKOY7dmwRW9Xa_IUK_-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217046/DSCF2777.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PxaWwh"&gt;If you have a lot of money to spend, perhaps it’s time you investigate a TV upgrade? My colleague Chris Welch has done the leg work of researching&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; the best models to take advantage of the Xbox Series X’s graphical power, VRR support and HDMI 2.1 capability&lt;/a&gt;. Prices start at around $950 for a 65-inch QLED TV from TCL, with OLED options from LG sitting at the top around $2,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsARB1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 3rd, 10:46AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve added in the Xbox Wireless Headset, as well as a link to our buying guide for other gaming headsets. Also, I’ve put in my colleague Chris Welch’s buying guide for the best 4K TVs for the Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various MacBook models available for purchase, including ones equipped with the new M1 processor, finding a deal on an Apple MacBook is not very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals on the Mac mini computer. Of course, there are frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations, and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a full one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 ($50 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ADk8N"&gt;Amazon also has the 512GB configuration on sale; you can get it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $1,180&lt;/a&gt; ($70 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1299, but it’s on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can buy some older MacBook Pro models: one includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. It features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and storage configurations. You can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600 at Amazon, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor for $1,800 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to the processor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and better speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FZV45H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another configuration available in the same color&lt;/a&gt;, but more storage (1TB) and an Intel Core i9 processor available for $2,499 ($300 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QLBQ9T"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the mini has Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We have seen this computer go down as low as $600 (for the base model), but you can get it for $30 off its usual starting price of $699 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Why Epic is burning its own cash to cook Apple</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Lh_CWksVTEeNbQChEmAiGYACqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227410/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Follow the money, baby&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LsnEyS"&gt;Epic Games didn’t sue Apple to get a big payout, but that’s because the lawsuit itself is an investment. And to rewrite Apple’s rules, Epic is spending a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZOgc0"&gt;The reason Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;got thrown out of the Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt; was that Epic rogue-updated &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to offer a payment mechanism that bypassed Apple’s 30 percent cut of all in-app transactions. Apple booted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; for violating its rules. Epic threw an… epic… hissy fit about this, culminating in the trial starting this week. While Epic has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;cobbled together an alliance&lt;/a&gt; called the Coalition for App Fairness — along with Spotify, Match Group, Basecamp, and Tile — there’s one more tech behemoth in play. Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/announcing-epic-direct-payment-on-mobile"&gt;runs on Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;. So does &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/EPICGames/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MIZjT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Fortnite’ pretty much prints cash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sAYbBt"&gt;The fight with Apple echoes Epic’s tactics elsewhere. The Epic Game Store is a clear challenge to Valve, which has an iOS-like store called Steam that also takes a 30 percent cut of sales. In a basic act of moral consistency, the Epic Game Store contains — in addition to games by other developers — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22396021/itchio-epic-games-store-windows-pc-apps"&gt;other game stores&lt;/a&gt;. It also takes only a 12 percent cut of sales. Just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;Microsoft announced&lt;/a&gt; it would cut its take on PC games to 12 percent to match Epic, from 30 percent. (It also filed &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21810025/statement_support_microsoft.pdf"&gt;a letter of support&lt;/a&gt; for Epic in the current case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TY5x2"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in 2019 that the Epic Game Store’s hardball tactics against Valve will continue until either the store is profitable or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18334865/epic-games-store-versus-steam-valve-pc-gaming-console-war-reimagined"&gt;Valve lowers its cut&lt;/a&gt;. Epic will torch an estimated $593 million by the end of 2021 on the Epic Games Store, according to &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/502037049/21-04-07-Apple-Proposed-Findings-of-Fact-and-Conclusions-of-Law"&gt;court documents in the Apple case&lt;/a&gt;. At many companies, losing this much money would be a problem, but that figure is only slightly more than &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; revenue from April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which was $400 million that month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOEqIJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; pretty much prints cash because the video game industry has hit on a business model that almost no other part of the entertainment industry can match: in-app payments. For Spotify, it’s not a fatal problem to dodge the App Store and its cut. I just go to a desktop computer, enter my credit card information, and — thanks to recurring billing — I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEuk7f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is different, and it’s why a video game company is leading the effort to challenge the App Store payment rules. In &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, if I want to buy a sweet dance move, I spend Epic’s V-Bucks to do it. The store refreshes every day, so if I want the new hotness, I need to act immediately. (There’s also a seasonal pass and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612524/fortnite-crew-subscription-chapter-2-season-5-price-release-date"&gt;a recently-introduced monthly subscription&lt;/a&gt;, but these do not seem to be as explicitly geared toward impulse buys.) Last year, in-app purchases were estimated to account for &lt;a href="https://wappier.com/blog/iap-statistics"&gt;40 percent of all gaming revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bTY20"&gt;Epic’s position gets weirder. Part of the story will involve people who imprinted on Neal Stephenson like ducklings, but before we get there, let’s run down what we know about the economics of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and the Epic Games Store to get a rough sense of how much money is in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YvJdF0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At some level, Apple’s being greedy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTAp2k"&gt;It’s true that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is free to download, but in-app purchases more than make up for that. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;Epic Games had revenue of $4.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;, with earnings of $730 million. (We know this because Epic, a private company, sold a stake, and &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/15/epic-games-shareholders-seeking-to-sell-stake-for-750-million-at-17-billion-valuation/"&gt;those meddling kids at VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; got a hold of numbers as a result.) Epic’s 2020 numbers are forecast at about $5 billion in revenue, with $1 billion in earnings, according to VentureBeat; in the court documents, Epic’s total 2020 revenue is projected at a mere $3.85 billion. In the two years &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was available in the App Store, iOS customers alone accounted for $700 million in revenue for Epic, according to the court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNDoFw"&gt;“Epic is in a fortunate position because &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is the most popular game in the world,” says &lt;a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/k/christopher-e-krohn"&gt;Christopher Krohn&lt;/a&gt;, an adjunct associate professor of marketing at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAnBjl"&gt;Apple’s revenue split from digital purchases is a little complicated — it’s got special rates for small developers, for instance — but in Epic’s case, Apple gets 30 percent of all in-app purchases. That’s in line with &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2001/04/minitel-the-old-new-thing/"&gt;Minitel&lt;/a&gt;, the French pre-internet, which also had a 30 / 70 split for third-party content, says Bill Maurer, a professor of anthropology at the University of California Irvine who specializes in payment processors. Frankly, it looks like a carrier fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlGmK5"&gt;“At some level, Apple’s being greedy, because it doesn’t depend on this revenue,” says &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/michael-a-cusumano"&gt;Michael Cusumano&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguished professor of management at MIT’s Sloan Business School. “It’s rolling in money from the iPhone itself.” On March 28, Apple reported its quarterly earnings — almost $24 billion in net income, riding mostly on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-28/apple-sales-crush-wall-street-estimates-on-surging-device-demand?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;strong sales of the iPhone and Mac&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;previous quarter&lt;/a&gt; was a blowout for the company, with revenue of more than $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="SLZ133"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic wants to build the “metaverse,” an online haven where superhero IP owned by different companies can finally kiss&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6C5qM"&gt;Greed isn’t illegal. It’s also probably what’s motivating Epic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369622/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ban-basic-freedoms-developers"&gt;despite its CEO’s bluster&lt;/a&gt;. Epic wants to build &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;something called the “metaverse&lt;/a&gt;,” an online haven where superhero IP owned by different companies can finally kiss. (The idea is based on &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/neal-stephenson-metaverse-snow-crash-silicon-valley-virtual-reality"&gt;a 1991 book by Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;.) The revenue potential here is the kind of thing that sends VCs into &lt;a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse"&gt;thinkfluencing fever dreams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzQwSN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is already a hangout space, one where IP from Marvel and DC can legally interact. Add to that the Unreal engine, which fuels a number of games as well as shows such as Disney’s &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, and its other developer tools, and you’re looking at what could potentially be &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-epic-games-metaverse-and-is-it-worth-billions"&gt;a piece of a metaverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Should &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the Epic Games Store, or another Epic offering underpin a major chunk of a metaverse, the amount of money Epic is torching on its store and these lawyers will look like &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse"&gt;a wise investment&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;em&gt;fuckload&lt;/em&gt; of money it stands to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zEvaq"&gt;You can see why they might not want to cut Apple — or Valve, or Google, or &lt;em&gt;anyone at all&lt;/em&gt; — in at 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="965O3I"&gt;Look, I’m going to pop my popcorn and, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnites-mastermind-goes-to-battle-with-apple-11619236807"&gt;as Sweeney put it&lt;/a&gt;, “enjoy the upcoming fireworks show” at the trial. I don’t think the outcome will matter much, since any verdict is going to get appealed &lt;em&gt;immediately.&lt;/em&gt; But at the very bottom, it seems obvious that Epic’s position is the same as Apple’s: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVxYOQS6ggk"&gt;greed is good&lt;/a&gt;. Forget the fight to own the metaverse. The &lt;em&gt;real world&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/technology/big-tech-pandemic-economy.html"&gt;belongs to Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re just NPCs who drop loot for the corporate players.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel drops the first glimpse of Oscar-winner Chloé Zhao’s Eternals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i8i8Z6Vc7jPsjypKEU8WVUvRH4o=/419x0:1940x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227381/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_9.41.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZfEMpp"&gt;Marvel has just revealed a first look at one of its most exciting upcoming projects: &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, the studio’s next big superhero team-up that’s set to arrive in theaters on November 5th. It’s the next big project from Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao, following her Best Picture and Best Director wins for &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTRdnT"&gt;Unfortunately, the teaser (which primarily serves as a hype reel for Marvel’s return to blockbuster films after a months-long pandemic-induced break from theatrical releases) doesn’t provide too much footage from &lt;em&gt;Eternals. &lt;/em&gt;Instead, there are&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;just a few quick glimpses of some of the bigger stars, including Salma Hayek’s Ajak riding a horse, Kumail Nanjiani’s Kingo staring off into the distance, and Richard Madden’s Ikaris standing at the front of the team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaHDBG"&gt;The teaser’s biggest moment (aside from a wide perspective showing several of the new heroes suited up) goes to Angelina Jolie, wielding a gigantic sword made of light. Presumably, a more substantial trailer will arrive in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yjYpAmJys9VpWK4xE1ETpo2NWlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488020/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_9.41.21_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OF3xiY"&gt;The biggest takeaway is that &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; may start to deliver on Marvel’s years-long promise of creating films with more diverse casts than the seemingly endless array of dudes named Chris who have dominated the first decade of films — something that’s particularly encouraging to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7r0WZ"&gt;Along with a brief look at &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, the teaser reel also drops a surprising amount of Marvel news, including official title announcements for &lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; (previously referred to as &lt;em&gt;Black Panther 2&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;The Marvels, &lt;/em&gt;the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; sequel, which will also serve as a follow-up to the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt; show on Disney Plus and will see Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) and &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/ms-marvel-introduces-iman-vellani-kamala-khan-disney-plus"&gt;Iman Vellani’s Kamala Khan&lt;/a&gt; team up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHgZOF4rfAYOLUg1RJuMwGnclSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488038/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_9.16.09_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z8nCewVu5iAu8I0tKJa6wUPmV3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22488037/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_9.16.15_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsIEbI"&gt;The hype reel also gives updated release dates for the next two years of Marvel Studios projects, including &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3. &lt;/em&gt;The current release schedule is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hQJWlx"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Widow: &lt;/em&gt;July 9th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7WnVla"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: &lt;/em&gt;September 3rd, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U2IMky"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Eternals: &lt;/em&gt;November 5th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F6mt3N"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;: December 17th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IoUWq7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;: March 25th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KC5pNo"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;: May 6th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MsOEDE"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt;: July 8th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="my2vLZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt;: November 11th, 2022&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YN4NTE"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt;: February 17th, 2023&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ROxqlS"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt;: May 5th, 2023&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hd3xPx"&gt;The teaser video wraps with another quick glimpse of the logo for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168833/the-fantastic-four-marvel-studios-cinematic-universe-jon-watts"&gt;Jon Watts’ upcoming MCU reboot of &lt;em&gt;The Fantastic Four&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but with no release date information. Given its place in the lineup, though, it won’t hit theaters until late 2023 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wegOZZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some of the best Nintendo Switch games are $20 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMxfMruOiRJ-DbrQqBH3eGDHDQI=/201x0:2370x1446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69227192/akrales_171025_2091_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao9MGG"&gt;Whether you’re a new or not-so-new Switch owner, everyone needs some good games to play. If you want some of the best titles released for Nintendo’s console, you can get them for $20 off their full $60 price. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen these discounts, but it’s rare that these price cuts extend to both physical and digital versions of the games. So if you’d prefer to purchase a game code so you can instantly download it to your &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;microSD card&lt;/a&gt;, that’s an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WqL3Ua"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514828"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="qndMFI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vvFtWt"&gt;You can find a few other Nintendo-published games like &lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis Aces&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;, and more discounted at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E8621E51-6EB3-4DF4-9BDD-0DFBCD2F7B2B"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo-switch-games-video%2F-%2FN-p86ax&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fnew%3Fprefn1%3DavailabilityFilter%26prefv1%3DshipsIn24Hours%26q%3DAll%26srule%3Dtop-sellers%26prefn1%3Dcondition%26prefv1%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. In other Switch-related deal news, a reputable eBay seller has copies of the &lt;em&gt;New Pok&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;mon Snap&lt;/em&gt; for $10 off its usual price. This is a great deal since this title released last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CwkUIs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABPaRd"&gt;For the lead-up to Mother’s Day on Sunday, May 9th, Amazon has discounted most of its tech, including the Fire TV Stick 4K, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CXG6C9W/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite e-reader&lt;/a&gt;, its Echo Show smart displays, and more. Whether you’re getting Mom a gift or snagging a gadget for yourself, some of these discounts are the best prices we’ve seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zKk7Dq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10351716"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHe1k7"&gt;Amazon is clearing out stock of its previous generation of Fire HD 8 and HD 10 tablets since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"&gt;a new iteration was announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, the best deals are on the Kid-friendly versions of the older tablets that include a protective case and a year-long subscription to Amazon Kids Plus (formerly known as FreeTime Unlimited) that provides complimentary apps, games, books, videos, and more. Normally $140, the eight-inch Fire HD 8 Kids is $90. The slightly smaller Fire 7 Kids is $60, down from $100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OvycW0"&gt;If you want a capable smart display that has a motorized screen that can move to remain visible as you walk around the room, Amazon’s latest Echo Show 10 is one of your only options. At that, it’s $50 off, which matches the best price we’ve seen for this model. You can pick one up in charcoal or white with a complimentary Ring smart bulb for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M1N8522?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers offer the same price but without the smart bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
