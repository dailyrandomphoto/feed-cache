    <title>Samsung announces cloud gaming for Tizen TVs, offers no further details</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25mxnt_k7UwTLdSILEeOcd6kzEQ=/459x0:2880x1614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048327/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_11.09.32.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SEqnMp"&gt;Samsung &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ElMqHkG26sM?t=1517"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s jumping into the cloud gaming arena with an offering for its Tizen smart TV platform. The news came during its Samsung Developer Conference keynote, and the company didn’t provide any more details about what games would be available, what other platforms it would be available on, if any, or when it will launch. Cloud gaming is an area that many of its big tech competitors are getting into, but it’s also an area Samsung has dabbled in before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJoENz"&gt;In the early 2010s, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3066544/samsung-gaikai-cloud-gaming-service"&gt;worked with a game streaming company called Gaikai&lt;/a&gt; to bring an early version of cloud gaming to its high-end TVs. The pitch was basically the same as it is these days — Samsung Cloud Gaming would let you play games with only a TV, internet connection, and controller. The system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/4/3137144/gaikai-cloud-gaming-samsung-smart-tv-beta-launched"&gt;even launched in beta&lt;/a&gt;, but then Gaikai’s new owner decided to go in a different direction. That owner, by the way, was Sony, and the tech was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/7/5284504/sony-playstation-now-gaikai-based-streaming-service-ps-ps2-ps3"&gt;eventually folded into&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;underwhelming PlayStation Now service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1RP9cf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung will face more competition in 2021 than it would’ve in 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOkpkf"&gt;In 2021, Samsung will face more competition than it would’ve in the early days from some big tech rivals — Google runs its Stadia service, Amazon is working on Luna, and more gaming-focused companies like Microsoft and Nvidia have their own offerings as well. Generally, though, the goal is to get game streaming services on as many platforms as possible, offering the same gaming experience on phones and TVs. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/changing-the-daily-life-of-the-future-sdc21-experts-discuss-next-generation-technologies"&gt;On a Q&amp;amp;A on its website&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung says that its goal with its cloud gaming service is allowing “users to play the latest games on their Samsung Smart TV equipped with the Tizen platform.” To me, that reads as a pretty exclusive service, though that could change in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2kD12"&gt;Samsung also says that it’s working with partners on the service and that it’s using web tech to power it. Samsung didn’t immediately respond to a request for more information about the service, but we’ll update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone is out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64E5gTYOD_9PcpCWYE_Gf49CTQw=/148x0:1771x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963739/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.28.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uAR9g2"&gt;A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring tried to make the future before it was ready. In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn talks to the visionaries at Handspring and dives into their early successes and eventual failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80clsG"&gt;It’s a half-hour-long documentary featuring the key players at Palm and Handspring: Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins, Ed Colligan, and more. It’s one of our most ambitious video projects to date, and we can’t wait to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO8iuz"&gt;Handspring may no longer be a household name, but it was briefly one of the fastest growing businesses in American history, selling Visor personal digital assistants. But the company had bigger aspirations: it saw a mobile future and took the first steps toward what would become the modern smartphone — even as it faced skepticism from the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGlhgO"&gt;The dream of the Handspring Treo turned out to be too far ahead of its time — before either the technology inside smartphones or the industry that sold them was ready for it. And a number of bad internal decisions and outside disasters would stall Handspring long enough that Apple would go on to do what Handspring couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Bphu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is also a look at an earlier time in tech — when the dot com bubble was bursting, but big tech hadn’t coalesced into five or six titanic monoliths. It was a time when many futures seemed possible, even one where a tiny startup could win the coming smartphone wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myh7cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is now streaming worldwide. You can watch it on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s new app on Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, or Apple TV. Visit your preferred streaming device’s app store and search for “The Verge” or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680029/the-verge-tv-app-android-tv-amazon-fire-tv-roku"&gt;learn how to download here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung promises Matter support for SmartThings hubs, Galaxy devices, TVs, and fridges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSVbEIbbZjqWdBg_IQW8HdMP6YQ=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047799/RF23A9771_Lifestyle_4D_Flex_FH_Counter_depth_BSS_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung announced its Family Hub refrigerators will be getting support for Matter and built-in SmartThings hubs. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vby8jA"&gt;The Matter smart home train is picking up steam. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"&gt;Google’s commitment to the new standard&lt;/a&gt; at its developer conference last week and Apple’s addition of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10298/"&gt;Matter support in iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC, Samsung is now following suit. The company announced a complete adoption of Matter across ​Samsung’s Galaxy devices, televisions, Family Hub appliances, and SmartThings hubs at SDC21, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.developer.samsung.com_sdc&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=Su-ijVCWM-EpsR7XUMEZwdX5A6GYA0UuAkKC7MrcZ3s&amp;amp;m=puQ5sRH_KYMGh44I4hv3EJ2Y_NgpeBcTFqp_VZE9kbU&amp;amp;s=crqv2qfHy7p2efmbuHUM0-flyO9_AzJybZsWRfYdZnU&amp;amp;e="&gt;its virtual developer conference&lt;/a&gt; being held this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g82fsv"&gt;A founding member of the Matter group (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;formerly known as Project ChiP&lt;/a&gt;), Samsung also announced that it has joined the &lt;a href="https://www.threadgroup.org/thread-group"&gt;Thread Group Board of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, where it will sit alongside the likes of Apple, Google/Nest, Lutron, Qualcomm, and Silicon Labs to shape the future of the primary protocol that Matter devices will run on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZILIez"&gt;Matter is a new connectivity standard created through an industry collaboration that aims to become the de-facto smart home application protocol. Once it goes live in early 2022, the idea is to simplify the purchase and setup of connected devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FujyOe"&gt;With Matter, consumers should be able to buy any Matter-compliant smart home device and know it will work with their smart home platform and voice assistant of choice, regardless of who made it. They should also be able to set up and connect each device with the same process, using the same app, to make the whole thing as easy to do as screwing in a light bulb used to be.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="smartthings hub-news-smartthings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GuxXH3Sr4yaMW4pR0B-xDZlwGUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6384453/products-hub.e9aba541.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SmartThings hub, which Samsung stopped manufacturing last year, will now be built-in to Samsung televisions and smart fridges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xrKnV4"&gt;With Samsung SmartThings adopting Matter, it will be possible to add devices that previously couldn’t connect to the SmartThings app or hub and, in reverse, connect SmartThings compatible devices to other Matter-enabled smart home ecosystems. For example, an Eve LED light strip that previously only worked with Apple’s HomeKit could be added to and controlled by the SmartThings app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JNZWcg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All existing SmartThings hubs will adopt the standard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLESx"&gt;Consumer choice is the significant feature here. If you like using the Google Home app, the SmartThings app, or the Apple Home app to control your devices, you can do so without having to worry if it’s Google-enabled, SmartThings-enabled, or HomeKit-enabled. If it works with Matter, it will work with all three apps and all three compatible voice assistants (along with many more). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCJUe3"&gt;SmartThings, founded in 2015, was already one of the most open platforms of the big smart home ecosystems, offering support for both Zigbee and Z-Wave protocols, and now, it’s adding Matter. Regarding which SmartThings products will be Matter-enabled, Samantha Fein, Vice President of Business Development and Marketing at SmartThings, said the SmartThings app would be fully Matter-enabled, and all existing SmartThings hubs will adopt the standard, including those now being made by Aeotec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiWsUc"&gt;In terms of Samsung products, Samsung will enable Matter as a controller for its televisions and smart appliances, “As well as other Galaxy products,” Fein said. She couldn’t share specific product names as they are still working on the rollout, which will begin next spring. But it’s safe to assume, at this stage, that will include Samsung smartphones to enable easy setup and control of Matter-enabled smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RsP3EL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re utilizing Matter as a central thought for us around what the future smart home looks like”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="lKC6M3"&gt;SmartThings hubs move inside&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="QPS6mc"&gt;Samsung also announced that it will build SmartThings hubs into its TVs and Family Hub refrigerators. This means, in theory, there should be no need for a separate SmartThings hub device. This is something Samsung had previously announced but is only just implementing. Fein couldn’t confirm if there would be upgrades for existing televisions and smart fridges or if this would only apply to new devices going forward. But she did confirm that it will be a software-based “hub,” saying there will not be smart home radios in the products, as there are in the existing stand-alone hubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fUO3Z"&gt;However, when pressed about the future potential for a smart fridge or TV to be a Thread Border Router, she hinted that would be possible. “We’re very excited about the future and utilizing Matter as a central thought for us around what the future smart home looks like,” Fein said. Thread is the low-powered mesh protocol that is a primary way Matter devices will communicate, and border routers are devices that will help extend connectivity throughout a home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Va0q2p"&gt;Ultimately, Fein made it clear that SmartThings is moving away from its physical hub-based origins and towards a more integrated hardware experience with Samsung products. The recent launch of &lt;a href="https://developer.samsung.com/smartthings/blog/en-us/2021/08/19/new-smartthings-edge-for-devices-and-automations"&gt;SmartThings Edge&lt;/a&gt;, which allows device-to-device communications to run locally, even without an internet connection, enables a future where multiple hardware radios might not be necessary to keep a smart home running smoothly. “Directionally, that’s what we’re hoping to achieve,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWrnwG"&gt;As everyone sits around and waits on Matter and its promise of smart home interoperability, there is one company that has been suspiciously silent of late. Amazon has had very little to say on the &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; since announcing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586377/amazon-echo-matter-standard-dot-show-studio-flex-plus-upgrade"&gt;Echo speakers will get Matter-support&lt;/a&gt; earlier this summer. At this stage, I’ll classify that as slightly worrying for the forward momentum of the adoption of Matter, although we’re not quite at “completely concerning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2ZyF3s"&gt;Bixby buzz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5zDef"&gt;Samsung also had a few updates for Bixby, its beleaguered smart voice assistant. While there is no word on whether the Galaxy Home Bixby smart speaker will ever see the light of day — “We ... will provide updates on the availability of Galaxy Home in the near future,” said a spokesperson — Bixby is getting a new ability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hX65l3ydVQfW3oSNVZ0mI0j0c34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11959599/galaxy_home.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Home Bixby smart speaker still doesn’t have a release date, but the voice assistant has some new tricks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="369qiR"&gt;The Bixby Home Platform announced at the developers’ conference will bring something close to Alexa and Google Home Routines to the voice assistant. Now, with a single voice command, you can execute multiple tasks. For example, if you say “Bixby, play a movie from Netflix,” you can have more than one SmartThings-connected device respond. So the lights could dim, the soundbar would turn on, and the movie begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRevZh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X0x7W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 26th, 2:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Clarified that SmartThings Edge allows device-to-device communications to run locally, without using the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrsJj9"&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tzg9ic"&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9enuyo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune: Part Two is officially happening to adapt the other half of the book</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gBYEwa_7mP6CV7H0XmPQUc37C1U=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048202/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mbijbo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is officially getting a sequel, with Warner Bros. and Legendary announcing that &lt;em&gt;Dune: Part Two&lt;/em&gt; will continue the story (and, presumably, adapt the rest of the original novel) that began in the recently released film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbnXKh"&gt;The sequel is set to hit theaters in October 2023, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/dune-sequel-greenlit-by-legendary-warner-bros-theatrical-release-1234862383/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, with director Denis Villeneuve returning for &lt;em&gt;Part Two&lt;/em&gt;. Core cast members like Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, and Javier Bardem will presumably return to reprise their roles as well, although there’s no official word on casting yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GsdQew"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dune puts an epic franchise ahead of its epic story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yISkIX"&gt;It was all but guaranteed that Dune would be getting a sequel: the film literally starts with a “&lt;em&gt;Dune: Part One&lt;/em&gt;” title card and very obviously tees up a second film by abruptly ending just as Paul joins forces with the nomadic Freman warriors (coincidentally, the rough midpoint of the book version of &lt;em&gt;Dune, &lt;/em&gt;too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CCz6UO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is only the beginning...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you to those who have experienced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dunemovie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dunemovie&lt;/a&gt; so far, and those who are going in the days and weeks ahead. We're excited to continue the journey! &lt;a href="https://t.co/mZj68Hnm0A"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mZj68Hnm0A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Legendary (@Legendary) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Legendary/status/1453058884516466691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L26Ijd"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; debuted concurrently on both HBO Max and in theaters, audiences shouldn’t expect the sequel to get a similar treatment: Warner Bros. has already announced that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;future films will be debuting in theaters&lt;/a&gt;, and a massive sci-fi blockbuster like the Dune sequel is certain to not be an exception to that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yozlo0"&gt;Warner Bros. isn’t being subtle about its franchise ambitions for Dune, either: the studio has already announced plans for an HBO Max prequel series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18660482/warnermedia-dune-series-denis-villeneuve-television-film-frank-herbert-bene-gesserit-sisterhood"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune: The Sisterhood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will focus on the powerful order of women known as the Bene Gesserit who manipulate galactic politics and wield mysterious powers. There’s no word on a release date (or even basics like casting) yet, but &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/dune-tv-series-hbo-max-showrunner-diane-ademu-john-1235024854/"&gt;Diane Ademu-John was recently hired&lt;/a&gt; as writer, showrunner, and executive producer for the series earlier in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEmNgi"&gt;Fans will have to wait a while to see the other half of the book on the big screen, though: &lt;em&gt;Dune: Part Two&lt;/em&gt; (or whatever the film ultimately ends up getting called) hasn’t started filming yet, and isn’t expected to hit theaters until October 2023 at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T’s confusing 5G Plus expansion confirms T-Mobile was right all along </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFEkF5TRi-tYKnit7lVEJt_rsSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048196/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXRhNn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s new 5G Plus expansion gives T-Mobile the perfect “I told you so” moment. AT&amp;amp;T currently offers two “flavors” of 5G: 5G Plus over the high-band mmWave spectrum and regular 5G, which is comparable to 4G LTE. Now, &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2021/c-band-5G.html"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; details that AT&amp;amp;T is bolstering 5G Plus with the mid-band C-Band spectrum in 2022 — a concept that T-Mobile has been preaching for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeC7jf"&gt;Former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8930691/tmobile-ceo-trashes-verizon-att-5g-plans"&gt;T-Mobile CEO John Legere slammed AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; for not having a mid-band spectrum in 2019, stating that 5G needs a low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrum to work efficiently. This is because that high-band mmWave 5G offers the fastest speeds over shorter distances, making it best for highly concentrated areas. Conversely, low-band 5G provides the bare minimum for speed over wider areas. Offering 5G service with no in-between isn’t ideal — a mid-band range serves as the median between both spectrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SSTPo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dear wireless carriers: the 5G hype needs to stop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zNR3bo"&gt;Until this year, T-Mobile was the only major carrier with access to the entire range of spectrums. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T invested nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt; combined to gain access to the C-band spectrum in February, making both companies two years behind T-Mobile. AT&amp;amp;T plans on lumping together mmWave and C-band under 5G Plus, and it doesn’t appear that it’s giving you a way to distinguish between the two bands. T-Mobile operates similarly, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675255/tmobile-5g-uc-icon-iphone"&gt;it displays a “5G UC” icon&lt;/a&gt; when you’re connected to either its mid-band or high-band spectrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6BWd7"&gt;All this relabeling by mobile carriers isn’t making the transition to 5G any less confusing. With each service introducing its own nicknames for their fastest 5G speeds and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T mislabeling its old 4G service as “5Ge,”&lt;/a&gt;  the 5G mess becomes less and less appealing by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US lays out new guidelines for vaccinated international travelers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Frankfurt Airport During Covid-19 Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4KqAwWBmbjCWZDARrX-BZ8zrKM=/0x87:5739x3913/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047853/1236079894.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TKOB2T"&gt;Fully vaccinated international travelers will now be allowed to travel to the United States with proof of vaccination, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1025-International-Travel-System.html"&gt;CDC announced&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. The order will go into effect on November 8th and applies to non-US citizens who are not immigrants, with an exemption for children under 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJgopN"&gt;The order will require fully vaccinated travelers with FDA-approved and World Health Organization emergency use listed vaccines to have a negative test taken three days before their travel date. Travelers who are not fully vaccinated, including US citizens and permanent residents, will now require a test within one day of their US travel date. This rule exempts children under two and accommodates people who have a documented recovery from COVID-19 in the past 90 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01rkJS"&gt;Since child vaccine availability varies across countries, different requirements will be put in place for children under 18 for international travel, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-releases-additional-detail-for-implementing-a-safer-more-stringent-international-air-travel-system/"&gt;according to a detailed report by the Biden Administration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhUgn0"&gt;Children between the ages of 2 and 17 are required to take a COVID-19 test pre-departure. An unvaccinated child traveling with a fully vaccinated adult can test three days prior to their travel date. However, children traveling alone or with an unvaccinated adult are subject to the one-day testing rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWicMs"&gt;Passengers will also be required to provide basic contact information to allow faster contact tracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKcmMq"&gt;This new program comes after the White House &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727979/us-date-reopen-borders-vaccine-foreign-visitors"&gt;announced in early October&lt;/a&gt; its plan to reopen US borders for most vaccinated foreign travelers and end restrictions at the borders and ferry crossings with Mexico and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eUpu6C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The US has set a date to reopen its borders to vaccinated foreign visitors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727979/us-date-reopen-borders-vaccine-foreign-visitors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MWMp4E"&gt;The White House said &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/10/25/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-covid-19-and-international-air-travel-policy/"&gt;in a press briefing&lt;/a&gt; that it would put out these documents two weeks before the new rule goes into effect to give airlines and travelers time to get used to this new system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An9b0e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KO1Gdr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AirPod Beanies bring back the infamous iPod Sock for a new generation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jT3MUK6RViekZh1ci_ayv2w8sEA=/0x26:1596x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047691/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_12.17.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QBhx1W"&gt;The infamous iPod Sock is getting a successor of sorts from accessory company Native Union, in the form of the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nativeunion.com%2Fproducts%2Fairpods-beanies&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22746794%2Fairpod-beanies-apple-ipod-sock-native-union" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Beanies&lt;/a&gt;” — a cozy knit case where you can put your AirPods’ existing case for an added layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlXMhG"&gt;For those of you who are a bit lost right now, a quick piece of history. Of all the products that Apple has made over the years, the iPod Sock definitely is one of them: a set of six colorful, two-tone knit sleeves that were designed to fit Apple’s various iPods for both style and protection. A bizarre piece of Apple’s history on par with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733198/apple-polishing-cloth-clean-devices"&gt;recent $20 screen cleaning cloth&lt;/a&gt;, the iPod Socks sold for the rather expensive (for socks) price of $29 for a pack of six. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sWeZzZKusvrRuuY7UmNXPrS9FhY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956843/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_12.19.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original iPod Socks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3PUfPo"&gt;But thanks to their relatively universal size (because, again, they were basically just knit socks) and bright colors, the iPod Socks were relatively popular and stayed on shelves for almost a decade before Apple discontinued the product in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Yu8P8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nativeunion.com%2Fblogs%2Fnative-union-journal%2Fa-trip-down-memory-lane&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22746794%2Fairpod-beanies-apple-ipod-sock-native-union" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Native Union’s remake&lt;/a&gt; aims to emulate the overall style of the original iPod Sock, with the chunky ribbed knitting, two-tone color scheme, and even the tag at the corner (albeit with the company’s logo instead of the Apple and iPod marks). Native Union has also updated the size, making them more appropriate for AirPods cases (more diminutive than iPods) and updated the hues for a trendier pastel lineup. The company also assures that the AirPod Beanies won’t impact wireless Qi charging and that they’ll universally fit all of Apple’s earbud cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtOXJQ"&gt;The Native Union AirPod Beanies are sold in a pack of four for $19.99 and are available now from its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApjQlb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seagate violated sanctions by selling hard drives to Huawei, says Senate committee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Seagate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZnyDyooPZfAq5AdVwscMXC0lUI=/0x0:5300x3533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70047528/1010166416.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WPyuGg"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/437DD8B6-1F71-4BBF-ADB3-BC0B89C1CC1A"&gt;US Senate committee says&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer Seagate likely violated government sanctions by shipping hard drives to Chinese manufacturer Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nojpV"&gt;The Republican minority staff of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation released a report alleging Seagate ignored &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/tech/huawei-us-sanctions-hnk-intl/index.html"&gt;August 2020 restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on shipping semiconductor components to Huawei — a category the report alleges “likely includes hard disk drives.” The report orders Seagate to stop shipments to Huawei and urges the US Commerce Department to “prioritize” enforcement of the sanctions, which the Trump administration implemented after claiming Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18634401/huawei-ban-trump-case-infrastructure-fears-google-microsoft-arm-security"&gt;posed a national security threat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0v5bCS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seagate said in 2020 that the sanctions shouldn’t disrupt its shipments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NlDzMg"&gt;Huawei has used Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba hard drives for its &lt;a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/09/09/huaweis-extraordinary-enterprise-storage-growth-rate-set-to-peak/"&gt;growing external storage business&lt;/a&gt;. The report says Western Digital and Toshiba ceased shipments after the sanctions, which banned companies that operate in the US from selling some products to Huawei without a license. But &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/the-curious-case-of-storage-devices-and-huawei"&gt;Seagate said&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 that it didn’t believe it needed such a license for its hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rcv8Te"&gt;Congressional Republicans publicly &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-senator-asks-firms-about-sales-hard-disk-drives-huawei-2021-05-11/"&gt;grilled hard drive companies&lt;/a&gt; about Huawei earlier this year. The report says that Seagate officials confirmed in October 2021 that it hadn’t applied for a license to sell to Huawei, and while the officials said they had stopped shipping hard drives to Huawei, they didn’t say exactly when the shipments had stopped. Citing documents and industry reports, the report concludes it was “common knowledge within the storage industry” that Seagate continued them well after the August rules took effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32o7TK"&gt;The report claims Seagate reaped a windfall by ignoring the sanctions on Huawei. “Seagate’s stock has increased nearly 86 percent since the rule went into effect,” the report notes. “The initial incline began around October 2020, soon after the effective date, as Seagate purportedly continued shipments to Huawei as its sole American supplier of hard disk drives.” It also concedes that the chip shortage may have raised stock prices across the board, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZFltZ"&gt;A Seagate spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/seagate-broke-export-curbs-by-supplying-huawei-senate-republicans-say-11635254101"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company “complies with all laws applicable to its business and operations, including export control regulations.” It declined to comment specifically on its relationship with Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05K8za"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said it was “committed to fully investigating” any allegations of violations, including ones related to Huawei and China. “Enforcement actions can generally be made public at the end of the investigation,” a spokesperson said of the agency’s next steps. “BIS is committed to briefing Congressional offices at the conclusion of such an investigation and looks forward to continued dialogue with Congress on our national security and economic interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoDDOJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from the Commerce Department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Cm0Pw"&gt;General Motors will start making Chevy Bolts again on November 1st, after shutting down production in late August following a global recall of the electric vehicle due to battery fire risk. The production restart at the company’s Orion assembly plant in Michigan will last for at least two weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/gm-resume-limited-2022-chevy-bolt-production-mich-plant?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, though GM isn’t saying what will happen after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSanX8"&gt;The production restart will come just a few weeks after GM announced that battery supplier LG agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722317/chevy-bolt-recall-paid-lg-electronics-gm-costs"&gt;foot the $2 billion bill for the recall&lt;/a&gt;. And it comes at a time when global supply chain shortages have most of the auto industry dealing with way more customer demand than it can handle — which has also been driving &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/sales-market/global-ev-sales-boosted-europe-china-chip-shortage-analyst-firm-says"&gt;more people than usual to buy EVs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jwEqsQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM recalled all Chevy Bolts ever made in August&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QL0npG"&gt;GM first issued a recall for 2017 to 2019 model year Bolts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a handful of reports of battery fires. It announced a purported preventative fix for the problem in May 2021, which involved installing software that would monitor for early signs of a fire in the battery pack. But by July, two more vehicles caught fire that had the new software, causing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;GM to recall those same Bolts again&lt;/a&gt;. In August, GM recalled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;all model year Bolts&lt;/a&gt; — including the two new versions that hit the market this year — as it worked with LG to fix the underlying problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wz7nc0"&gt;That problem had to do with the manufacturing process of the LG batteries that power the Bolt, which was making it possible for two specific defects to appear simultaneously in the cells. If and when those two defects are present, the risk of a fire goes way up, especially for owners who repeatedly drain the battery to almost zero and charge back up all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qhhyW"&gt;GM and LG started making what they believe are defect-free battery modules earlier this month. Most of them are earmarked for replacing the modules in the 140,000-plus recalled Bolts, but Tuesday’s announcement could be a sign that the companies are getting closer to having enough batteries to handle the recall while also getting the 2022 Bolt and Bolt EUV back on dealer lots.&lt;/p&gt;
