    <title>Google confirms diversity exec no longer in role after problematic post</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="laUksJ"&gt;One of Google’s top executives in diversity strategy and research has left his post after a 2007 blog post slamming the state of Israel resurfaced on June 1st. In the post, Kamau Bobb used antisemitic language, insinuating Jews have an “insatiable appetite for war and killing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37YRi"&gt;The post was quickly picked up by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;. “While Google has been a vocal supporter of diversity initiatives... it has not commented on the recent spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes,” &lt;a href="https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/google-diversity-head-said-jews-have-insatiable-appetite-for-war/"&gt;read a &lt;em&gt;Washington Free Beacon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article on the subject&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvq8H6"&gt;But the controversy likely didn’t start with the right-wing press. It seems to have initiated internally, with an email from a member of Google’s Jewish employee resource group. On June 1st, an employee sent a note to the Jewish employee listserv, which has more than 3,000 members, writing that they were  “deeply concerned about antisemitism within our DEI leadership.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mQrG2"&gt;The email read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq0qwK"&gt;As the subject indicates, I’m very concerned about antisemitism within our leadership. Our Director of Diversity Strategy and Research appears to have strong opinion about Jews and Israel. I’ll let you all have a look at his blog for yourselves, but here are some quotes that you’ll find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a96bB5"&gt;“If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing in defense of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGvquI"&gt;“The ability of the United States and Israel to not only dictate the terms of my subjugation but characterize my desire to be free as rooted in hatred would burn my intellect and my sensibility as a human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5IU6q"&gt;“Looming large, like a grand dark cloud of human atrocity, is the slaughter of Palestinians by unrepentant Israeli Jews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2bCdz"&gt;Does anyone else think this is totally inappropriate for someone in this kind of position? I’m scared that someone at this level has these kinds of feelings about Jews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lMoJ7s"&gt;The thread spiraled, garnering roughly 80 responses, with multiple calls for Bobb to be fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqJFa9"&gt;More moderate members of the group felt that while the blog post sounded problematic, the underlying sentiment resonated. “The language of this letter is very hurtful and antisemitic,” says a current employee who asked to remain anonymous. “That said, digging up an old blog from over a decade ago feels like a witch hunt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmW87X"&gt;Later that evening, Bobb sent an email to the Jewish employee resource group, apologizing for what he had said. “What I wrote crudely characterized the entire jewish community,” he wrote. “What was intended as a critique of particular military action fed into antisemitic tropes and prejudice. I think we can all agree, there is no easy solution to this situation. But that’s beside the point. The way I expressed my views on that conflict were hurtful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xwTd1"&gt;Now, Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Bobb is no longer a member of the diversity team, though he remains at the company. “We unequivocally condemn the past writings by a member of our diversity team that are causing deep offense and pain to members of our Jewish community and our LGBTQ+ community,” wrote a Google spokesperson in a statement. “These writings are unquestionably hurtful. The author acknowledges this and has apologized. He will no longer be part of our diversity team going forward and will focus on his STEM work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKDsAt"&gt;Google did not respond to further questions about what focusing on “STEM work” means. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqOie8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3CSss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2aI4Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giR0Va"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook to end special treatment for politicians after Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8ob2M-0BqMSQNF9E8FC2boLdsc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69402015/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SY6tpr"&gt;Facebook plans to end its controversial policy that mostly shields politicians from the content moderation rules that apply to other users, a sharp reversal that could have global ramifications for how elected officials use the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1TpWJ"&gt;The change, which Facebook is set to announce as soon as Friday, comes after the Oversight Board — an independent group funded by Facebook to review its thorniest content rulings — affirmed its decision to suspend former President Donald Trump but critiqued the special treatment it gives politicians, stating that the “same rules should apply to all users.” The board gave Facebook till June 5th to respond to its policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEIsJb"&gt;Facebook also plans to shed light on the secretive system of strikes it gives accounts for breaking its content rules, according to two people familiar with the changes. That will include letting users know when they’ve received a strike for violating its rules that could lead to suspension. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-zuckerberg-what-if-trump-disputes-election-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other outlets have previously reported on instances when Facebook employees intervened to keep political pages from being subject to harsh penalties under the strikes policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xaGY0y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zuckerberg previously said Facebook shouldn’t police speech by politicians&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CfhdBa"&gt;Facebook is also set to begin disclosing when it uses a special newsworthiness exemption to keep up content from politicians and others that would otherwise violate its rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YPwNk"&gt;A spokesperson for Facebook had no comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqDjrz"&gt;The changes are notable for Facebook since it historically has taken a hands-off approach to what elected officials say on its service. Company executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have said that they shouldn’t be in the business of policing speech by politicians. They’ve argued that such speech is already the most scrutinized in the world, and that private companies shouldn’t censor what politicians say to their citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzz9Vc"&gt;For the past few years, Facebook has maintained a list of political accounts that aren’t subject to the same fact-checking or content moderation processes that apply to other users. In 2019, a group of employees asked for the list to be dissolved, citing internal research that showed people were especially likely to believe falsehoods if they were shared by an elected official, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-researchers-found-companys-political-whitelist-influenced-misinformation-spread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HwrnsK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The policy faced blowback over Trump and violent comments in India&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXdVGF"&gt;That same year, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, clarified the policy publicly, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/elections-and-political-speech/"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; “we will treat speech from politicians as newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard.” Beyond expressly illegal content such as child pornography, Facebook would only take action against comments by politicians if they could credibly lead to physical harm or discourage voting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buOF9z"&gt;Content from other sources that politicians share, such as news links or videos, has already been subject to fact-checking, a step that can greatly reduce the distribution of posts. Under Facebook’s new policies, posts made directly by politicians still won’t be subject to review by the company’s network of independent fact checkers. But they will for the first time be opened up to enforcement against more rules for things like bullying that Facebook’s moderators apply to other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QjtxY"&gt;The hands-off policy for political speech faced intense blowback when Trump used Facebook to stoke division after the murder of George Floyd and later praised his supporters as they attempted a violent insurrection at the US Capitol in January. And in India, Facebook’s largest country by users, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hate-speech-india-politics-muslim-hindu-modi-zuckerberg-11597423346"&gt;come under fire&lt;/a&gt; for not taking action against violent comments made by members of the ruling party. Under the new policy for politicians, Facebook could still use its newsworthiness exemption to leave up a post that would otherwise be taken down. But it will commit to disclosing when it does so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R86MLh"&gt;After the January attack on the Capitol by Trump’s followers, Facebook indefinitely blocked his ability to post and referred the decision to the Oversight Board, a group of human rights experts it set up to make judgements on its policy enforcement. The board responded saying that Facebook was wrong to take special action on Trump’s account, since its public policies don’t explain when it can indefinitely block someone’s ability to post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uteAZK"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/226612455899839-oversight-board-upholds-former-president-trump-s-suspension-finds-facebook-failed-to-impose-proper-penalty/"&gt;written response&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook on May 5th, the board called on the company to “address widespread confusion about how decisions relating to influential users are made.” Facebook was given 30 days to respond to the board’s recommendations and six months to complete its review of Trump’s account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is updating AirTags to make them less creepy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QOSWYvghxFn8weHchD7bXIkdAs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401765/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ4Ki1"&gt;Apple is distributing an AirTags software update that makes it harder for people to use them for surreptitious tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-bolsters-airtag-privacy-measures-to-offer-android-detector-app-later-this-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. According to a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple is also working on an app for Android users which will let them detect potentially unwanted trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoHH1q"&gt;AirTags were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as Apple’s solution for helping people keep track of everyday objects. In its marketing, Apple shows people finding their lost keys or bags that have the trackers attached. However, there have been concerns the tiny devices are being used to secretly track people without their knowledge, and we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review/"&gt;numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; since the AirTags’ release indicating that some tweaks were needed to make the devices more privacy-conscious for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B1up2"&gt;Before the update, if AirTags were away from their owner, they would chime &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-airtag-privacy-loopholes"&gt;after three days&lt;/a&gt; if they detected that they were moving. If you had a fully up-to-date iPhone, you might get an “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;AirTag Found Moving With You&lt;/a&gt;” notification &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;before then&lt;/a&gt; — but un-updated iPhone users and Android users were out of luck until that chime. Apple is now updating the AirTags to chime at some point between eight and 24 hours of separation, significantly reducing how long an AirTag can travel before telling on itself. (Apple didn’t respond to request for comment on the range of times it provided.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQlugy"&gt;Apple says the Android app will be coming “later this year” and will be able to detect both AirTags and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My network accessories&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFtfZW"&gt;Eight to 24 hours is still a long time to be tracked without knowing, but it’s good to see that Apple is at least starting to address some of people’s concerns. The update is out today and should happen automatically when an AirTag comes into proximity with an iPhone similar to how AirPods silently receive updates, according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xomul"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden signs order banning US investment in Chinese surveillance companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tulsa Commemorates 100th Anniversary Of Tulsa Race Massacre" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brN_nq9eTc6qszICVkIvUfVr7Gg=/0x0:6192x4128/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401672/1321197115.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MCTXS2"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/03/executive-order-on-addressing-the-threat-from-securities-investments-that-finance-certain-companies-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; Thursday expanding a Trump-era ban on Americans investing in Chinese companies with purported ties to China’s military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuZtJK"&gt;The order increases the number of restricted Chinese companies from 48 to 59. It also rewrites &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2020/11/12/trump-bans-americans-from-investing-in-companies-that-support-chinas-military/"&gt;a previous order issued&lt;/a&gt; by former President Donald Trump to include companies that create and deploy surveillance technology, like the technology used against Muslim minorities and dissidents in Hong Kong. The move signals that Biden plans to continue some of the same China-related policies previously put in place by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTLXar"&gt;The order does not include DJI, WeChat, TikTok, or its parent company ByteDance among the 59 companies, despite previous concerns about those companies’ ties to China. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21358093/trump-tik-tok-ban-bytedance-transactions-executive-order"&gt;Trump signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to ban Chinese apps like TikTok and WeChat from US app stores, but Thursday’s order is separate from Trump’s move to ban these apps. In February, the Biden administration asked &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/11/wechat-trump-biden-pause/"&gt;a federal appeals court&lt;/a&gt; to place a hold on any legal proceedings regarding these app bans. It’s still unclear how Biden plans to address the TikTok ban going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IxXCqC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="blzXRh"&gt;“We fully expect that in the months ahead ... we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” a White House official told &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-order-ban-investment-59-173000498.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yahoo News &lt;/em&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1t9h3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/biden-china-surveillance-order.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the move is part of the Biden administration’s commitments refusing to facilitate human rights abuses in China. For years, the Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/technology/china-surveillance.html"&gt;has used a confluence&lt;/a&gt; of facial recognition technology, phone scanners, and artificial intelligence as part of a sweeping surveillance push to empower China’s police force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfW1SE"&gt;The order bans Americans from investing in these additional Chinese firms starting on August 2nd. This extends to Americans investing in funds that then invest in Chinese firms as well. The order allows current investors in these companies to divest their holdings over a one-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q58fi"&gt;Under this new order, the Treasury Department will be in charge of the list of banned companies. The Trump administration had previously put the authority on the Defense Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiE7Rd"&gt;The federal government has been pushing for broader action against Chinese tech and telecom companies for years. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission designated telecom companies Huawei and ZTE &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308477/fcc-huawei-zte-ban-universal-service-fund-national-security-threat-risk"&gt;as threats to national security&lt;/a&gt;. Surveillance technology is sometimes sold as part of a package deal when nations abroad purchase Huawei equipment, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/biden-china-surveillance-order.html"&gt;according to the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Last September, the FCC estimated that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;would cost $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; to “rip and replace” equipment from these firms that is already embedded in US networks; Congress has yet to allocate any such funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wy2Ft5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus will launch its cheaper $5 plan next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8Yu9j1Anz0LyVNJKGLACzLbRI8=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69401187/paramount_plus.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Paramount Plus logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2CgxnC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/1082915/3065?subId1=VergeParamountPlusNewOffer060321"&gt;Paramount Plus &lt;/a&gt;is set to introduce a new ad-supported plan on Monday that will cost just $5 per month — half the price of its more premium plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfpmOJ"&gt;The primary difference between what the service is calling its “essential” plan and the more expensive commercial-free plan — besides the addition of ads — is some missing content. The $10 commercial-free plan includes both local and national news coverage with CBSN and CBS live, whereas the new essential plan only includes national news with CBSN. There’s more sports coverage on the commercial-free plan as well, and premium users also get support for offline downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8WQQg"&gt;Both plans include access to tens of thousands of TV episodes and movies, as well as the platform’s originals, but premium tier subscribers will only see ads on live TV programming and a handful of series. Of note, the new budget plan — which will replace an existing limited-commercial tier — will not include a user’s local live CBS channel that’s also included in the limited-commercial experience, a spokesperson for the service confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W2w9a1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new $5 plan will replace an older $6 tier carried over from CBS All Access&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SjYa8i"&gt;As was announced when the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315338/paramount-plus-hands-on-nickleodeon-mtv-streaming-tv-movies"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; in March, the new tier will replace an older $6 option that was carried over when the service rebranded from CBS All Access. The commercial-free plan normally costs $10 per month, but the company offered a limited commercial programming option for $6 per month. Though those who are currently on the $6 plan can remain on that tier if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyz3AV"&gt;If you’re a current subscriber to an existing $6 plan grandfathered in from CBS All Access, you may want to stay on the slightly more expensive plan you’re currently on — at least if local news coverage is important to you. Additionally, if a limited-commercial subscriber opts into the new $5 plan, they will not be able to switch their plan back to the $6 tier after June 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRZQfF"&gt;In other words, if you’ve been considering a Paramount Plus subscription and would like local news coverage included in your ad-supported experience, now’s the time to subscribe. If limited advertising is less important to you than shaving a buck off your streaming tab every month, then keep an eye out for the new plan come launch day on June 7th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration makes $1 billion in grants available for broadband on tribal lands</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IX1NtC"&gt;The Biden administration will make $1 billion in grants available to expand broadband access and adoption on tribal lands, Vice President Kamala Harris &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/06/department-commerces-ntia-announces-nearly-1-billion-funding-expand"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; at the White House Thursday. The funds, from the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), will be made to eligible Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian entities for broadband deployment, to support digital inclusion, workforce development, telehealth, and distance learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vArc00"&gt;“For generations, a lack of infrastructure investment in Indian Country has left Tribes further behind in the digital divide than most areas of the country,” Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. “We have a responsibility as a country to build infrastructure that will fuel economic development, keep communities safe, and ensure everyone has opportunities to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8inln"&gt;According to the Commerce Department, census figures show only half of households on tribal lands subscribe to home internet service, and some areas lack even the most basic cellphone reception. More than 20 percent of people living on tribal lands don’t have broadband access at home. And during the pandemic as schools closed, some students at tribal-serving schools had to drive for miles to find a strong enough connection to participate in online classes. However, the number of people without internet access on tribal lands is likely even higher, as data from the Federal Communications Commission on broadband access, which many government agencies rely on, can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;notoriously inaccurate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xfZP8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2021/ntia-announces-tribal-consultations-new-program-increase-broadband-access-across-indian"&gt;Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/12/covid-relief-bill-includes-1-billion-for-tribal-broadband-and-250-million-for-fcc-telehealth-program-in-provisions-sought-by-cantwell/ab843eb5-c457-4780-9448-56c0179e6a6d"&gt;coronavirus relief package&lt;/a&gt; Congress passed in December, will fund programs to help make broadband more affordable for tribal areas to help fund the digital divide, the Commerce Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KisgM4"&gt;NTIA will be holding webinars to inform the public &lt;a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=333974"&gt;about the grants&lt;/a&gt;. The next Tribal Broadband Connectivity webinars will be held on June 16th and 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic showed that Big Tech isn’t a public health savior  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mNm6SdOcWwLL4HWPeysghsedfb0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69400528/acastro_210602_4613_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Public health takes a village, not a tech campus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1dK7Q6"&gt;Two days after the World Health Organization declared that the coronavirus outbreak was a pandemic, then-President Donald Trump stood in the Rose Garden next to a flow chart. The chart promised that soon, it would be easy for anyone in the United States to get tested for the virus. According to Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197026/trump-coronavirus-testing-website-plan-google-covid-19"&gt;Google was building a website&lt;/a&gt; to streamline the entire process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V56XEz"&gt;It was the first of many promises that private companies would swoop in and rescue or bolster the country’s flailing COVID-19 response. Public health infrastructure in the United States has been underfunded for decades, and its underlying tech infrastructure is outdated and clunky. Health departments relied on fax machines and paper printouts to ferry data around. Fighting the pandemic would require a clear view of how many people were sick and where those sick people were, but the US was flying blind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y2T6zx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We saw all over the papers: Facebook is gonna save the world, and Google’s going to save the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVu2HN"&gt;It seemed like Big Tech, with its analytic firepower and new focus on health, could help with these very real problems. “We saw all over the papers: Facebook is gonna save the world, and Google’s going to save the world,” says Katerini Storeng, a medical anthropologist who studies public-private partnerships in global public health at the University of Oslo. Politicians were eager to welcome Silicon Valley to the table and to discuss the best ways to manage the pandemic. “It was remarkable, and indicative of a blurring of the boundaries between the public domain and the private domain,” Storeng says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0oWyX"&gt;Over a year later, many of the promised tech innovations never materialized. There are areas where tech companies have made significant contributions — like collecting mobility data that helped officials understand the effects of social distancing policies. But Google wasn’t actually building a nationwide testing website. The program that eventually appeared, a testing program for California run by Google’s sibling company Verily, was &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/25/california-has-quietly-ended-its-covid-19-testing-partnership-with-verily/"&gt;quietly phased out&lt;/a&gt; after it created more problems than it solved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7BtPX"&gt;Now, after a year, we’re starting to get a clear picture of what worked, what didn’t, and what the relationship between Big Tech and public health might look like in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vO94j"&gt;Tech companies were interested in health before the pandemic, and COVID-19 accelerated those initiatives. There may be things that tech companies are better equipped to handle than traditional public health agencies and other public institutions, and the past year showed some of those strengths. But it also showed their weaknesses and underscored the risks to putting health responsibilities in the hands of private companies — which have goals outside of the public good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCbVI8"&gt;“Big tech companies can be extremely useful,” says Andrew Schroeder, who runs analytics programs at the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. “The question is, how do you make sure that designing with the public good in mind actually happens?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MBhnTL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3TSy5m"&gt;When the pandemic started, Storeng was already studying how private companies participated in public health preparedness efforts. Over the past two decades, consumers and health officials have become more and more confident that tech hacks can be shortcuts to healthy communities. These digital hacks can take many forms and include everything from a smartphone app nudging people toward exercise to a data model analyzing how an illness spreads, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVUBJq"&gt;“What they have in common, I think, is this hope and optimism that it’ll help bypass some more systemic, intrinsic problems,” Storeng says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CDGKt"&gt;But healthcare and public health present hard problems. Parachuting in with a new approach that isn’t based on a detailed understanding of the existing system doesn’t always work. “I think we tend to believe in our culture that higher tech, private sector is necessarily better,” says Melissa McPheeters, co-director of the Center for Improving the Public’s Health through Informatics at Vanderbilt University. “Sometimes that’s true. And sometimes it’s not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrI7gs"&gt;McPheeters spent three years as the director of the Office of Informatics and Analytics at the Tennessee Department of Health. While in that role, she got calls from technology companies all the time, promising quick fixes to any data issues the department was facing. But they were more interested in delivering a product than a collaboration, she says. “It never began with, ‘Help me understand your problem.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XF31I0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’d have folks come in and say, ‘We can solve your opioid problem because we’ve solved bank fraud before’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AaMjuU"&gt;Before the pandemic, tech companies tended to assume that one data problem was the same as another, McPheeters says. Broadly speaking, they didn’t appreciate how important it was to understand epidemiology and public health in order to work with the data in that field. During her tenure at the department of health, for example, she oversaw efforts to develop a data-driven response to the opioid epidemic in the state. “We’d have folks come in and say, ‘We can solve your opioid problem because we’ve solved bank fraud before,’” McPheeters says. While there may be similar data science involved, the social environment on the ground — how people were behaving, and why — is just as important as the data itself. In that respect, there aren’t many similarities between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHeVYk"&gt;This isn’t to say that there can’t be data-driven solutions to public health problems. Tech companies can have important roles to play during infectious disease outbreaks, like offering data-crunching expertise or platforms to analyze information. But companies have to work as partners, not outside disruptors, McPheeters says. That’s hard to do on the fly during an emergency when there hasn’t been a history of collaboration. “One of the challenges of a situation like this pandemic is that if you haven’t built those relationships already, it’s very difficult for those relationships to suddenly flourish,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kFXZre"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="22MGPb"&gt;Even without a history of robust collaboration, governments were eager to welcome tech companies to the table during the early phases of the pandemic response. When COVID-19 took hold in the United States, the country’s public health infrastructure had been crumbling for years. Underfunded and understaffed health agencies worked on &lt;a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/policy-value-based-care/public-health/article/21147049/pandemic-reveals-public-health-data-infrastructure-shortcomings"&gt;outdated data systems&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t have the resources to invest in new ones. Many test results were still sent on fax machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Trump declares national emergency in coronavirus fight" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPj9vW-TWBxS9zVjG-4VC7BNdLs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22622426/1207061487.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;In March 2020, Trump promised a Google-built website that never materialized. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enjeoi"&gt;Faced with the typical levels of public health problems, the systems could keep themselves together. But under the strain of a devastating pandemic, the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/pandemic-data-america-messy/618987/"&gt;cracks split&lt;/a&gt;. There weren’t reliable ways to send information on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths between hospitals, labs, and health agencies. Health officials didn’t have the resources to monitor the spread of disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cu0huq"&gt;Scrambling, officials took tech companies up on offers to take on some of the burden. “They got handed the keys to the kingdom,” says Jorge Caballero, an anesthesiologist at Stanford University and co-founder of the volunteer group &lt;a href="https://codersagainstcovid.org/"&gt;Coders Against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCnGoo"&gt;Some of the first pandemic problems tech companies tried to tackle were COVID-19 testing projects. Google sibling company Verily piloted a testing system in California in March 2020, and eventually inked $55 million in testing contracts with the state. “They started off with this big overture that they could offer a turn-key solution to the state of California,” Caballero says, and to other states, as well. But by October 2020, two counties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534517/california-verily-testing-google-covid-inequity"&gt;phased out&lt;/a&gt; the Verily testing program over concerns that it was asking for too much patient data and wasn’t accessible to low-income groups that had the greatest need for testing. The state’s &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/25/california-has-quietly-ended-its-covid-19-testing-partnership-with-verily/"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Verily ended in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbOq5E"&gt;Google also wanted to link people to testing sides nationwide, and testing sites started showing up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225828/google-showing-covid-19-testing-centers-search-results"&gt;Google searches&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of April 2020. The company pulled in location data from state governments and groups like Castlight Health, which had its own testing site directory, Hema Budaraju, director of product management at Google, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cFDsT"&gt;That Google project was technically a success — someone could search for a testing site and find one. But there was a problem with the approach, Caballero says. Any changes to testing site data would take a few days to update. But many COVID-19 testing sites, particularly those targeted at underserved communities, were temporary pop-ups. The lag meant those wouldn’t show up in search. Caballero tried to flag that issue to Google in spring 2020 but says he wasn’t impressed with its response: it took Google a long time to acknowledge the concern, and even then, he says it didn’t seem to him like it fully understood the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAdVKl"&gt;Budaraju tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Google relied on its partners to provide accurate testing site information, and that it makes updates if those partners flag any missing locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GuAyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Health experts are always concerned that a push toward high-tech solutions would widen inequities rather than alleviate them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lcCPpt"&gt;Health experts are always concerned that a push toward high-tech solutions would widen inequities rather than alleviate them. If Google wasn’t including pop-up testing sites or was updating them on a lag, people who live in areas without many medical resources — which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/17/835487746/doctors-bring-coronavirus-testing-to-underserved-communities"&gt;were targeted&lt;/a&gt; by those pop-up sites — may have had a harder time finding them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3we9z"&gt;After someone tests positive for COVID-19, the next step for health officials is to identify the people who that person had been in contact with to encourage them to quarantine or get tested themselves. Tech companies thought they were positioned to help with that, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X2pAG"&gt;One of the flashiest attempts tech companies made to fight the pandemic was the Google and Apple exposure notification program. The companies teamed up on an app-based system that utilized Bluetooth to keep tabs on which smartphones spent time near each other. Then, if someone tested positive for COVID-19, they could alert strangers whose phones had been nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKmb3l"&gt;In theory, this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222161/apple-google-bluetooth-contact-tracing-system-coronavirus-health"&gt;could help&lt;/a&gt; track down people who had been exposed to COVID-19 but wouldn’t have been identified by traditional contact tracing, which relies on sick people remembering everyone they’d been in touch with while they were contagious. “There was a naivete about it,” Storeng says. “Wouldn’t it be awesome if I could just be notified when I’m exposed to infection, and that can solve it all?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Phone App Warns Of Covid Exposure" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WECk0p9bs9ERkEbMeAyq2cxknHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22161150/1290167857.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;California released an exposure notification app in December 2020. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aWYbYf"&gt;In the end, evidence on the system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168473/coronavirus-contact-tracing-apps-exposure-notification-covid-google-apple"&gt;was mixed&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, only a small percentage of people used apps built on the system — likely not enough to make a difference in the trajectory of the pandemic. In the United Kingdom, where a quarter of the population signed up, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03606-z_reference.pdf"&gt;researchers estimated&lt;/a&gt; it helped avert hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZwxJk"&gt;All of the data, though, are estimates: because of the app’s focus on privacy, officials around the world can only extrapolate from the number of people the app notified about a possible exposure. There’s no way to know if people who got those notifications actually isolated themselves or got tested for COVID-19. Without that data, officials can’t evaluate how many infections the exposure notification programs prevented. It also meant that they weren’t able to learn &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; was notified about a possible exposure, let alone get in touch with them to offer support or resources. That information stayed in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4vdbl"&gt;It’s an example of a tech company building a digital system without incorporating the most important elements of the manual program it’s attempting to augment. McPheeters says that contract tracing can’t be as effective if there isn’t any connection to the people who were exposed. “If you look at the history of contact tracing and you talk to experienced contact tracers, it’s actually about relationship building,” she says. “It’s not about tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W08OfQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding lanes that work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vW86rt"&gt;There are success stories from the past year. One clear bright spot was mobility data. Companies like Facebook and Google tracked how people’s movement patterns changed in response to social distancing policies. Before the pandemic, there hadn’t been anything like the sweeping stay-at-home policies introduced by governments around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzrAl6"&gt;“This was really chaotic. Nobody really knew what was going to happen, or if anyone would listen to these policymakers,” Schroeder at Disaster Relief says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyofOx"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/7/21209595/google-mobility-reports-facebook-disease-prevention-maps-tech-privacy-backlash"&gt;started releasing&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports in April 2020, and Facebook pushed out similar information through its Data for Good program, which builds datasets in partnership with humanitarian organizations and academic research institutions. That helped researchers understand how people’s behavior changed under new policies. “It went from flying blind, to not flying totally blind,” Schroeder says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6mpPCx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It went from flying blind, to not flying totally blind”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTrdLz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/reports/Working%20paper%20%E2%80%93%20model-based%20estimates%20of%20COVID-19%20burden%20in%20King%20and%20Snohomish%20counties%20through%20April%207.pdf"&gt;Seattle area researchers&lt;/a&gt; used Facebook’s data for one of the earliest looks at how movement patterns affected the spread of COVID-19. Other cities, like New York City, used the information to tailor their public health response. The data also informed academic research on COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Facebook-Data-for-Good-2020-Annual-Report-1.pdf"&gt;over the past year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srdoQF"&gt;Tech companies are the only resources for this data, Schroeder says. “There’s no government anywhere that’s producing this, no nonprofit producing it — if you want that information, the only way to do that is through one or another private tech company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMvmzz"&gt;Through Data for Good, Facebook also started running large-scale surveys in partnership with academic researchers. One project, the KAP COVID dashboards, was a collaboration with the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The group surveyed people in 67 countries about their COVID-19 knowledge and pandemic behaviors. Facebook provided the platform, and the researchers designed the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A March 2020 COVID-19 testing site in Seattle, one of the earliest pandemic hot spots. Researchers used Facebook data to look at how movement patterns changed the disease’s spread.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmK12"&gt;“It’s a phenomenal resource. There’s really nothing like it,” says Douglas Storey, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs working on the project. The team has used its findings to run webinars with working groups in the countries it surveys and to share information about how people are modifying their behavior to prevent COVID-19 spread. The team has started to incorporate questions on vaccine acceptance, as well. Then, countries can use the information for their own pandemic response strategies, Storey says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZr8Js"&gt;The Data for Good team was eager to work with the scientists, he says, and seemed to have a clear sense of the areas in which it didn’t have expertise. “They seemed genuinely committed to understanding how they can have a more positive impact.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a51LcZ"&gt;These enormous, worldwide surveys could only really be done by big tech companies like Facebook. “Facebook, every single day, is surveying hundreds of thousands of people all over the world,” Schroeder says. “Could any government run a survey, daily, globally, at that scale? The UN doesn’t have the ability to do that, and they’re the only ones who would have the authority globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A7t8yr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Could any government run a survey, daily, globally, at that scale?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zVdu5"&gt;Notably, Facebook and Google weren’t doing their own interpretation of this data — they supplied it to public health experts and left them to do the epidemiology. That’s an important part of the Data for Good approach, Laura McGorman, policy lead on the team, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our partners provide the domain expertise required to make use of these tools to solve real-world problems — whether it’s in public health, natural disaster response, or climate change. This work is extremely collaborative and plays to the unique strengths of everyone involved,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFE5hZ"&gt;It’s different from, for example, the exposure notification program — where Google and Apple built a self-contained product that collected and used data. In the recovery from the pandemic, as tech companies continue to push into healthcare and public health, there’s an open question around which approach will win out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SFzlc"&gt;“What is the role Big Tech should play as a neutral data publisher, and what role should it have in terms of producing something where analysis has already been done?” Schroeder asks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wqoGz7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning for the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nYihD3"&gt;Despite the mixed record on tech contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic, coalitions of companies are gearing up to keep pushing into healthcare. It’s a hugely lucrative area that they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166673/technology-health-care-amazon-apple-uber-alphabet-google-verily"&gt;already interested in&lt;/a&gt; before the pandemic — the healthcare market is a nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf"&gt;$4 trillion industry&lt;/a&gt; in the US alone. Last summer, for example, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) launched the &lt;a href="https://cta.tech/Resources/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2020/July/Major-Health,-Tech-Leaders-Join-CTAs-New-Initiati"&gt;Public Health Tech Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a working group that includes CVS, Facebook, Microsoft, and other major players. It plans to analyze the things that did — and didn’t — go well for tech companies during the pandemic and leverage that experience to prepare for the next health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gY0AgP"&gt;To start, the group is focusing on health data and virtual care, says René Quashie, vice president of digital health at the CTA. Members are talking about projects like an early warning system for public health that aggregates data from wearables, or creating data sharing platforms for public health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4FLD1"&gt;“We would envision sort of a new paradigm, more of a public-private partnership where public health agencies and government bodies are able to leverage the technological expertise of the private sector,” Quashie says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Az1uiG"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “What is a public good coming from private companies?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w05AuN"&gt;Some experts remain wary about the implications of integrating the private sector even more tightly with public health. Public health is supposed to be just that: public, and governed with the public good in mind. “What is a public good coming from private companies?” Schroeder asks. “Could you have some kind of structure that draws on what they’re good at, but doesn’t turn the authority over to them? I have no idea.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGI5v6"&gt;The goal of public health is to make a community healthier, not just individuals. Everyone shares in the success of reducing the spread of a disease like COVID-19, for example — no one is excluded from the benefits of lower levels of disease, even if they don’t personally contribute to reduction efforts. Turning a public health task over to a private company could turn the overall goal of a project away from the pursuit of a collective good and toward accomplishments that would benefit the company. It may &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; lead to collective good, but that might be secondary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70u1Mw"&gt;Companies that used their resources to fight COVID-19 got something out of it. Whether it was lucrative contracts, good PR, or even just helping their customer base stay healthy — it benefits companies to participate when the world’s health is on the line. As the emergency of the pandemic recedes, companies’ motivations to venture into public health and healthcare may change — and consumers and governments should pay attention to that changing landscape, experts say. “Does it have anything to do with health improvement, or is it about something else? Is it a way for these companies to harvest data, or get entry into new markets, or just some corporate social responsibility scheme to enable other kinds of activities?” the University of Oslo’s Storeng says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HuRIq"&gt;The mobility data, for example, was a huge boon to researchers through the pandemic. At first, many companies were giving that information away for free. “Now, it’s like, ‘About that free price,’” Schroeder says. He isn’t expecting Facebook to put up any paywalls. “The profit or loss on the mobility data or the survey data is a rounding error for Facebook,” he says. But it’s more of a concern for the smaller companies. Mobility data company SafeGraph, for example, offered its data for free to government agencies and nonprofits early in the pandemic but is now charging those users for data again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjmMQl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have to ask skeptical questions about the legitimacy of their involvement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fJ1oF"&gt;But it shows the tension created by relying on a private company for a critical public health service: it could, at any time, decide that it no longer wants to provide it to researchers — or it could decide that that valuable information comes with a price; private companies, after all, are first and foremost in the business of making money. Or, health officials have to make compromises on the terms and conditions around the data, as with the Apple and Google exposure notification program. “These are companies that have been known to be monopolistic, and potentially antithetical to democracy and free speech,” Storeng says. “You have to ask skeptical questions about the legitimacy of their involvement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xh7Lc"&gt;The pandemic highlighted the underlying weakness of the US public health system, particularly around its data systems and tech infrastructure: they’re outdated, disjoined, and underfunded, which leaves the country vulnerable to infectious disease threats. The past year opened the door for the tech industry to tackle some of those problems. Regardless of concerns around the companies’ intentions, it will likely stay open — and companies have made their interest in the space clear over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166673/technology-health-care-amazon-apple-uber-alphabet-google-verily"&gt;the past few years&lt;/a&gt;. They may be able to make useful, lifesaving contributions, but the public good still has to be the priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lWT6RW"&gt;“What is really clear, and I think this was clear well prior to the pandemic, is that tech does not substitute for strong public institutions,” Schroeder says. “Public health investment needs to happen independently of what any tech company does.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford delays Mustang Mach-E deliveries in the UK due to ‘safety risk’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SmtadszCT8KKVkDBy_mp7Q6et7c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69400513/sokane_210125_4386_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUYK8m"&gt;Deliveries of Ford’s first long-range electric vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, in the United Kingdom are on hold after a “safety risk” was discovered, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. It’s the latest delivery snafu to hit the automaker’s much-hyped electric SUV, after US customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234668/ford-delays-deliveries-mustang-mach-e-quality-checks"&gt;experienced similar delays earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bhxrK"&gt;But while the cause of the US delivery delays was unknown, the UK delays are a result of “incorrect location information when using the eCall system,” according to documents viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The eCall system, in which emergency services are notified when a vehicle’s airbags are deployed, &lt;a href="https://www.carbuyer.co.uk/tips-and-advice/155428/ecall-explained"&gt;is a European Union requirement&lt;/a&gt; in all vehicles manufactured after 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gCPc5S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“incorrect location information when using the eCall system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDgFFQ"&gt;“While investigations continue new vehicles ... must not be released to customers,” the announcement about the hold to dealerships read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQlG0U"&gt;The Mustang Mach-E SUV is Ford’s first update to the iconic Mustang brand, and the company’s biggest foray into the EV marketplace. The news of the delay also comes on the heels of Ford’s announcement that its EV sales were up 184 percent in May, which included the sale of 1,945 Mustang Mach-Es. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fy2iAP"&gt;The UK is going to be a major part of Ford’s push into new EV markets. In May, the automaker staged a &lt;a href="https://fordauthority.com/2021/05/mustang-mach-e-fleet-invades-tiny-uk-town-amid-ford-ev-push/"&gt;large-scale marketing event&lt;/a&gt; in Fordwich, Britain’s smallest town, with the aim of getting more customers to consider switching to electric. Over several days in May, Ford allowed most of the town’s 380 residents to test drive the Mach-E, which is the only Ford EV available in the European market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uv1J6j"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;Ford acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that 4,500 customers in the US would have to wait an unspecified amount of time to receive their Mustang Mach-Es after an unexpected delay in deliveries. The automaker didn’t specify what was causing the delay, just that it was holding back the EVs “as part of our commitment to deliver a quality vehicle to customers.” To make up for the US delays, Ford said it gave affected customers an extra 250kWh of free vehicle charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1kpOn"&gt;Ford’s not alone in experiencing trouble with its EV. Volvo was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307866/volvo-xc40-recharge-delay-software-update-on-call-ota"&gt;hold a number of XC40 Recharge SUVs at US ports&lt;/a&gt; in order to ship a software update before the electric vehicles got to customers. Volkswagen also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess"&gt;ran into trouble during the launch of its ID 3 mass-market EV last year&lt;/a&gt; because of a software issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnN7Mu"&gt;A spokesperson for Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nanoleaf’s light-up wall panels now look like wood accent pieces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5mMthw5KLHOYGzgBzurFCIupbg=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69399208/Elements_7x_Dining_Winter_4000x2250px.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Elements accent lights&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K7ycSs"&gt;Nanoleaf, the company best known for illuminated panels that you stick to your wall, has announced the new Nanoleaf Elements line, a set of wall panels that are designed to look as nice turned off as they do when on. The new Elements line accomplishes this through a wood-like veneer that allows the light to shine through when its on but doesn’t look blank when the light isn’t in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0Lwaz"&gt;Aside from the new veneer, the Elements lights are very similar to Nanoleaf’s other hexagonal light panels. They glow from both the front and back of the panel, allowing for a double lighting effect, and can be programmed with different lighting patterns and effects. The Elements do not have a full color spectrum LED, but they are adjustable from warm to cool white. Nanoleaf includes 11 preset lighting effects, or you can use the app to program your own. The touch-sensitive panels can also be synced to music or adjust their white temperature automatically throughout the day based on circadian rhythms. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZMKagW8ruUipAvY2DqxuWnfWis=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22560542/Elements_10x_Panels_Off_Statement_Wall_4000x2250.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elements are designed to look good both on and off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FJhRwI"&gt;The base $299.99 Elements Smarter kit includes seven panels that can be arranged in whatever pattern you’d like. Add-on packs of three more light panels are available for $99.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYMLjZ"&gt;With this new design, it appears that Nanoleaf is attempting to make its product more accessible in more homes, as the wood veneer and lack of full RGB lighting effects have less of a nightclub vibe than previous products. But the basic premise remains the same: unlike standard lighting that is mostly meant to provide illumination, the Elements are purely decorative and meant to change the mood of a room, not brighten it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3X018a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwIu2_YHYEY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sQyZke"&gt;The new Nanoleaf Elements products are available through the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fnanoleaf-elements%2F%3Futm_source%3DPR%26utm_medium%3Dtech%26utm_campaign%3Delements_launch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F3%2F22466594%2Fnanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s website&lt;/a&gt; starting today, June 3rd, and will be at Best Buy stores later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPZE4N"&gt;In addition, Nanoleaf has announced that its light panels will become Thread border routers, allowing them to act as a hub on a Thread network and extend the signal throughout the home. The company already supports Thread in its Essentials line of smart lights and light strips and it says it will be possible to add Thread devices from other manufacturers to the Nanoleaf border routers. Thread is the main technology in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;forthcoming Matter smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to unite smart home devices and platforms and allow for more interoperability. Nanoleaf says the Thread compatibility will be added through a software update this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haFWRz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome will soon warn you when you might not want to trust an extension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oloOkW97UiHtdC8cs1c3qmruZjA=/1x0:1972x1314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69396912/install_dialog___friction__2x__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new dialog box will warn if an extension isn’t considered trusted.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhXju2"&gt;Google is rolling out new safety features for Chrome which are designed to make it easier to spot dubious downloads and extensions. They build upon the browser’s Enhanced Safe Browsing feature, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262923/google-chrome-privacy-security-safe-browsing-cookies-dns-https-extensions"&gt;launched last year&lt;/a&gt; to offer better warnings against phishing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcm933"&gt;When it comes to Chrome extensions, the browser will now show a warning if what you’re installing is not considered “trusted.” In order to be trusted, extensions need to come from a developer that has followed &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/"&gt;Google’s Developer Program Policies&lt;/a&gt; and has been around for “at least a few months.” That means brand-new developers won’t immediately be considered trusted by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Am9ZS2"&gt;When attempting to download an extension that’s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;trusted, Chrome will show a pop-up warning that you should “proceed with caution.” However, there’s still the option to “continue to install” the extension. Google says nearly three-quarters of the extensions on Chrome’s store will be considered trusted under its criteria. Not being “trusted” doesn’t mean Google thinks an extension is dangerous, but that its developer might be newer to the store or may have recently committed a minor policy violation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TB7j6j1H4QMiaprzHin-cXo8mIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556652/ezgif.com_gif_maker__12_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suspicious files can now go through a more thorough scan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yRZo4p"&gt;Chrome is also getting a new scanning feature for suspicious-looking downloads. In the future, any downloads that seem “risky, but not clearly unsafe” will offer an option to upload them to Google’s servers for a more thorough scan. This process can be bypassed if you prefer, but it offers an extra layer of protection when downloading files from the web. The new scanning option is offered in addition to the existing metadata checks that Chrome already performs on downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EhvQS"&gt;Google says the new features are rolling out gradually for Chrome 91, the version of the browser that released late last month.&lt;/p&gt;
