    <title>VR treatment for chronic pain gets FDA authorization</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj3sSMf-vicK-G7cEPztL9S47Bc=/0x0:880x587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150630/AppliedVR_shot_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Applied VR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eq1pok"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration authorized a virtual reality system as a prescription treatment for chronic back pain, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-marketing-virtual-reality-system-chronic-pain-reduction"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The therapy, called EaseVRx, joins the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/digital-therapeutics-for-substance-use-disorders-from-research-to-practice"&gt;short list&lt;/a&gt; of digital therapeutics cleared by the agency over the past few years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFDZUi"&gt;EaseVRx includes a VR headset and a device that amplifies the sound of the user’s breath to assist in breathing exercises. It uses principles from cognitive behavior therapy, which aims to help people recognize and understand various thought patterns and emotions. The program addresses pain through relaxation, distraction, and improved awareness of internal signals, the FDA said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCAqGh"&gt;The FDA authorized EaseVRx based on &lt;a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/2/e26292/"&gt;data from an eight-week study&lt;/a&gt; in 179 people with low back pain that had lasted six months or longer. Half used the EaseVRx program and half participated in another, two-dimensional virtual reality program that did not use cognitive behavioral therapy methods. Around two-thirds of participants using EaseVRx said they had more than 30 percent reduction in pain, while only 41 percent of the control group had a similar reduction. The reduced pain lasted for up to three months after the study for people in the EaseVRx group but not for the control group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTyDJ"&gt;The VR system could be an alternative option to opioid medications for back pain, Christopher Loftus, acting director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices at the FDA, said &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-marketing-virtual-reality-system-chronic-pain-reduction"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that psychological approaches &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/17/17276452/chronic-pain-treatment-psychology-cbt-mindfulness-evidence"&gt;can be effective treatments&lt;/a&gt; for chronic pain for some people, and proponents stress that targeting those components to pain doesn’t mean the pain is any less real. Still, cognitive behavioral therapy for pain is &lt;a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2021/11/11/how-cbt-harmed-me-the-interview-that-the-new-york-times-erased/"&gt;sometimes controversial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/07/chronic-pain-sufferers-should-take-exercise-not-analgesics-says-nice?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"&gt;efforts to integrate it&lt;/a&gt; into standard care have been met with &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/chronic-pain-guidelines-treatment-cbt-acupuncture-first-point-946088"&gt;worries&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be used as an excuse to pull people off &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/amid-the-opioid-crisis-some-seriously-ill-people-risk-losing-drugs-they-depend-on/2018/07/13/65850640-730d-11e8-805c-4b67019fcfe4_story.html"&gt;needed medications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zprlqj"&gt;EaseVRx was developed by the company AppliedVR, which is &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/appliedvr-testing-use-at-home-virtual-reality-therapy-for-chronic-pain"&gt;also testing&lt;/a&gt; its platform as a treatment for fibromyalgia pain, burn pains, or pain during childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkukQv"&gt;Its clearance for back pain comes around a month after the FDA approved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736894/fda-vr-tv-movies-treatment-lazy-eye-amblyopia"&gt;another VR treatment&lt;/a&gt;, used to treat a visual disorder in children. The agency has also cleared a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo"&gt;prescription video game&lt;/a&gt; called EndeavorRx to treat ADHD in kids between eight and 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s ‘Get It Today’ lets you pick up your online order at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-fRT1P94ksljl3A9zhUUSb4aSco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150608/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PJDK3J"&gt;If you’re tired of long shipping times, Samsung is now partnering with Best Buy to offer a “Get It Today” pickup option. This lets you make a purchase on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s online store&lt;/a&gt; and then pick it up for free within just a few hours at your local Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wt6GnUyzYIVvdfjyfX6swE4MLkM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019371/get_today_bestbuy.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Get It Today” option on Samsung’s website lets you choose a Best Buy store for pickup.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psFl6v"&gt;Select Samsung phones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, and portable audio devices are all eligible for same-day pickup at Best Buy. Once you’re at the checkout, just select “Get It Today” from the pickup / delivery options, and then choose the nearest Best Buy location. After you enter your payment information, just keep in mind that the shipping option defaults to home delivery for some reason, so you’ll have to change that back to your preferred Best Buy store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMrODY"&gt;The service sort of acts like a Best Buy availability tracker, considering that the devices are already in the Best Buy locations where you pick them up. So, you might be thinking: why not just go to Best Buy and buy the Samsung product there? The only advantage to ordering it directly from Samsung and picking it up in-store is that you can get deals exclusive to Samsung, as well as trade-in discounts, all while getting your order the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsVW0V"&gt;It’s also worth noting that while Samsung does provide free same-day delivery to your doorstep, it’s only limited to Dallas and New York City. What would be a little more exciting, though, is if Samsung started offering the same option all across the US. Best Buy already offers &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmisc%2Fsame-day-delivery%2Fpcmcat748300518938.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat748300518938&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same-day delivery&lt;/a&gt; everywhere, which — despite not being able to get a Samsung-exclusive discount — might make it a more attractive option for someone who wants the convenience of shipping to their home. Plus, Best Buy offers same-day pickup for any product, including Apple, so Samsung offering the same isn’t that noteworthy. Not to mention, Apple itself also offers &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/shipping-pickup"&gt;express in-store pickup&lt;/a&gt; at its stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XBHs9"&gt;All in all, the “Get It Today” feature only really comes in handy if you want to take advantage of Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/gift-ideas/early-offer-signup/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; or another discount but don’t want to wait for your order to be shipped to your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FbPtsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard’s rot goes all the way to the CEO, alleges bombshell report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Business Leaders Converge In Sun Valley, Idaho For Allen And Company Annual Meeting" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YpY3VcsAZI22E0I-JmepqAPVi9o=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150524/479841492.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oM6ztQ"&gt;Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has been aware of sexual misconduct allegations at the company for years and has had his own history of harassment and abusive behavior, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;bombshell report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl34EJ"&gt;The report contains many shocking and previously unreported allegations about Activision Blizzard, which has been under intense scrutiny following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;state of California’s July lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging the company has a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” The problems appear to go all the way to the top, as the new &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report contains numerous troubling stories of Kotick’s awareness of problems and of his own behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUBN34"&gt;In one instance, Kotick was aware that a former female employee at an Activision-owned studio alleged she was raped by her male supervisor, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, but Kotick reportedly kept this information from his own board of directors and didn’t tell them about the eventual settlement with the employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcgaC2"&gt;Here is one particularly horrifying story about Kotick’s own alleged behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="eneGcb"&gt;In 2006, one of his assistants complained that he had harassed her, including by threatening in a voice mail to have her killed, according to people familiar with the matter. He settled the matter out of court, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6SV1Am"&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vyifd7"&gt;In 2007, he was sued by the flight attendant on a private jet he co-owned. The flight attendant claimed the plane’s pilot had sexually harassed her, and, after she complained to the other owner, Mr. Kotick fired her. The defendants denied the allegations. In a separate action related to legal fees in the case, an arbitrator, citing what he said was sworn testimony, wrote that Mr. Kotick told the flight attendant and her attorneys, “I’m going to destroy you.” A spokesman for Mr. Kotick denied that he said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHmAVy"&gt;In 2008, they settled by paying the attendant $200,000, according to the arbitrator’s decision. A spokesman for Mr. Kotick said he couldn’t have fired her in retaliation for complaining because she never complained directly to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="77ORE9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; also reports that &lt;em&gt;Kotick himself&lt;/em&gt; was the one who drafted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;widely criticized letter&lt;/a&gt; that was supposedly written by Activision Blizzard exec Frances Townsend. Townsend, a woman, was publicly shamed and saw calls for her resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AV0HLs"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; shared publicly shortly after, Kotick apologized for the “Townsend letter,” saying “our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf.” He apparently didn’t see fit to mention that he drafted it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dxElT"&gt;A company spokesperson appeared to confirm his involvement with the “Townsend letter” by telling the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that Kotick takes responsibility for and regrets his participation. “Ms. Townsend should not be blamed for this mistake,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJXL0m"&gt;In that second Kotick memo, he announced that Activision Blizzard had hired an independent law firm to review the company’s practices — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;known union-busting law firm WilmerHale&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the state of California has accused Activision Blizzard and WilmerHale &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640302/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-update-withholding-info-expanded-victims"&gt;of “withholding and suppressing evidence.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUkqN8"&gt;Another shocking revelation from the new &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report is about Jen Oneal, who stepped down as co-lead of Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;three months after taking the role&lt;/a&gt;. She was appointed co-head of the studio in August alongside former Xbox exec Mike Ybarra after previous Blizzard president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;J. Allen Brack left the company&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, just one month after being appointed, Oneal wrote an email to the company’s legal team saying that she had been sexually harassed while at Activision Blizzard, that she was being paid less than Ybarra, and that she wanted to resign. “I have been tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against,” Oneal wrote, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv0z5N"&gt;This summary only scratches the surface of what’s included in the report, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;which you should read in full&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3VU07"&gt;An Activision Blizzard spokesperson shared this statement in response to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions about the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y8SHHc"&gt;We are disappointed in the Wall Street Journal’s report, which presents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO. Instances of sexual misconduct that were brought to his attention were acted upon. The WSJ ignores important changes underway to make this the industry’s most welcoming and inclusive workplace and it fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day to live up to their – and our - values. The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick’s direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct. And it is why we are moving forward with unwavering focus, speed, and resources to continue increasing diversity across our company and industry and to ensure that every employee comes to work feeling valued, safe, respected, and inspired. We will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nNevsb"&gt;Kotick also pushed back on the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report in a video message sent to employees on Tuesday and subsequently shared with the world in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2021/11/a-message-from-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;a written transcript&lt;/a&gt;. While he doesn’t commit to any new changes at the company, he does reiterate that “as I have made clear, we are moving forward with a new zero tolerance policy for inappropriate behavior — and zero means zero. Any reprehensible conduct is simply unacceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5m3yJK"&gt;In response, A Better ABK, an advocacy group formed by Activision Blizzard employees, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329"&gt;said that it&lt;/a&gt; “will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO.” The group says it will be hosting a walkout on Tuesday. Employees also walked out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YRepa9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have instituted our own Zero Tolerance Policy.  We will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO, and continue to hold our original demand for Third-Party review by an employee-chosen source.  We are staging a Walkout today. We welcome you to join us.&lt;/p&gt;— ABetterABK   ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alktst"&gt;In October, Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;took a massive pay cut&lt;/a&gt; and said that the company would be waiving forced arbitration for sexual harassment and discrimination claims. The Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the company and many senior execs, including Kotick, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684779/activision-blizzard-investigation-sec-activision-bobby-kotick"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify, Discord, and others are coming back online after a brief Google Cloud outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVNx-BX57ofAIk0zIwy_NEwi-rk=/68x0:728x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150358/image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKrPnB"&gt;Sites and services like Spotify, Discord, Snapchat, and Etsy seem to be recovering after an outage that brought them, and many other sites, down for a little less than an hour on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0XrfL"&gt;The culprit for the outages appears to have been Google Cloud, and &lt;a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/"&gt;the service’s status page&lt;/a&gt; still shows a networking issue is currently causing problems resulting in the 404 errors that appeared on affected web pages. An update to the status page posted at 1:17PM ET says “the issue with Cloud Networking is partially resolved,” and it does seem like most services are coming back to life, albeit with some experiencing a few bugs or long loading times. Google’s status page notes that there currently isn’t an ETA on when the problem will be fully fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8WaFj"&gt;A peek at DownDetector shows the sprawling impact of the issue, with everything from Pokémon Go to Home Depot experiencing issues. We’ve reached out to some of the affected companies and will update this post as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfrt8G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/6PM5mNd43NbMqjCZ5REh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Status Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yraHtf"&gt;Summary: Global: Experiencing Issue with Cloud networking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq85jp"&gt;Description: We are experiencing an issue with Cloud Networking beginning at Tuesday, 2021-11-16 09:53 US/Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBGYnG"&gt;Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PM95Vh"&gt;We will provide an update by Tuesday, 2021-11-16 10:40 US/Pacific with current details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l6BPI"&gt;We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KHfrp"&gt;Diagnosis: Customers may encounter 404 errors when accessing web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwe9NS"&gt;Workaround: None at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="Vlhg6x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;p id="7krI20"&gt;The tracker &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that many of the services started experiencing issues at the same time,  which points to a common provider experiencing issues, rather than something like an ISP disruption or individual sites coincidentally having issues at the same time. Similar to previous outages that came from problems at Fastly or AWS, the reliance of services on other providers can help them offer content at a massive scale, but if there’s a problem, then all of them can go down at once.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting a new Media Player app you can test today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXENMFZ_CYrgE64C4L_GpC5hARU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150419/MainScreen.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s new media player.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rh4BP0"&gt;Microsoft has created a new Media Player app for Windows 11, and it’s beginning to test the app with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel today. The redesigned Media Player app will support both audio and video, and it includes a design that better matches Windows 11’s UI improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDzyDx"&gt;“At the heart of Media Player is a full-featured music library that allows you to quickly browse and play music, as well as create and manage playlists,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/16/new-media-player-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;explains Dave Grochocki&lt;/a&gt;, a senior program manager lead for Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps team. “The update to the new Media Player will replace the Groove Music app.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8j5Cedbhli_tSwZ0uo4XagZwnaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019276/Playback_Music.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new artist imagery in Media Player.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOSLCj"&gt;The playback view in this new Media Player app includes album art or artist imagery, which will appear both in full-screen modes and the mini player option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvDXb1"&gt;Media Player will also support video, which is usually handled in Windows 10 and Windows 11 in a separate Films &amp;amp; TV app. “All your content in the music and video folders on your PC will appear automatically in your library, but you can also tell Media Player where to look for additional content in app settings,” says Grochocki.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhTTkZOuWVjilguF0IHHP0lTrf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019279/Playback_Video.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video is also supported in this Windows 11 Media Player app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6eDMfM"&gt;It’s clear this Media Player app is also designed to replace the legacy Windows Media Player app that still exists in Windows 11 today. Microsoft says this legacy app will continue to be available in Windows Tools, but it looks like the new Media Player for Windows 11 will be the primary way to watch video and listen to audio in the operating system soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyCveG"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test this new Media Player app with Windows 11 testers in the Dev Channel today, but the company hasn’t committed to a date for when all Windows 11 users will get this new app yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s sci-fi haptic glove prototype lets you feel VR objects using air pockets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Meta haptic glove prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cseyY47bU39t0JFgbVGQSWnERjA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150322/RL___Haptic_Glove_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irs7Vf"&gt;You cannot pet a dog in Meta’s new, high-tech virtual reality gloves. But researchers are getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PCp0P"&gt;Meta (formerly Facebook) is known for its high-profile moves into virtual and augmented reality. For seven years, though, it’s been quietly working on one of its most ambitious projects yet: a haptic glove that reproduces sensations like grasping an object or running your hand along a surface. While Meta’s not letting the glove out of its Reality Labs research division, the company is showing it off for the first time today, and it sees the device — alongside other wearable tech — as the future of VR and AR interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IMNP4"&gt;At a simplified level, Meta’s haptics prototype is a glove lined with around 15 ridged and inflatable plastic pads known as actuators. The pads are arranged to fit along the wearer’s palm, the underside of their fingers, and their fingertips. The glove also acts as a VR controller. The back features small white markers that let cameras track how the fingers move through space, and it’s got internal sensors that capture how the wearer’s fingers are bending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Reality Labs haptic glove" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGGnMyO-l4Ud2KaRFS9C2aInuew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019162/RL___Haptic_Glove_1scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OuQocj"&gt;When you put on the glove and enter a VR or AR experience, a sophisticated control system adjusts the level of inflation, creating pressure on different parts of your hand. If you’re touching a virtual object with your fingertips, you’ll feel the sensation of that object pressing into your skin. If you’re gripping a virtual item, the long finger actuators will stiffen, creating a sensation of resistance. These sensations work alongside visual and audio cues to produce the illusion of physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONZF7h"&gt;The tech draws on the relatively new field of soft robotics, replacing bulky motors with tiny air valves. Meta has been working on it nearly since it acquired the Oculus VR startup in 2014. It developed its first prototype — one finger with a single actuator — in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="piEsek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reality Labs has been working on this prototype for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KQwuk"&gt;One of the first experiences that Reality Labs head Michael Abrash recalls was looking at a virtual plate from inside a VR headset — where a single actuator, combined with the virtual image and the sound of rubbing the rough ceramic, was incredibly convincing. “I saw the plate, and I saw my finger on the plate, and I heard the sound — that kind of scraping sound across it — and I felt the vibration,” he says. “And I will tell you, I was running my finger over a ceramic plate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGNYM"&gt;Simulated touch isn’t an entirely new phenomenon. Even combining VR with something as simple as controller vibrations can make people feel more like they’re touching something, and many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/13/5805628/at-e3-virtual-reality-goes-beyond-goggles"&gt;have worked on wearables&lt;/a&gt; that either track users’ hands or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21037855/teslasuit-glove-vr-haptic-feedback-glove-announce-pricing-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;provide haptic sensation&lt;/a&gt;. Some even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14773870/axonvr-haptx-vr-haptic-box-pressure-temperature-gdc-2017"&gt;integrate temperature sensations&lt;/a&gt;, which Reality Labs isn’t prioritizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trgBiY"&gt;But Meta is poised to mass-market haptic gloves in a way other companies can’t. Most haptics device makers sell specialized products for military, industrial, or academic institutions. By contrast, Meta produces the dominant consumer-oriented Quest VR system and is putting billions of dollars toward &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;building a “metaverse” that integrates VR and AR&lt;/a&gt;. If it launches a haptic glove system, Meta can guarantee the system will work on the Quest and encourage app developers to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGAFXZ"&gt;Reality Labs imagines gloves being one of multiple controller methods for future glasses and headsets, alongside more lightweight solutions built on electromyography or EMG — a system that reads nerve signals on your arm and translates them into digital input. Meta acquired EMG wristband company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;CTRL-Labs in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the EMG team works separately from the haptic design team, although the two technologies could easily overlap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GktEq7"&gt;“[Doug] Engelbart and Xerox PARC are the only time that fundamentally the way we interact with the digital world has ever changed,” Abrash says — referring to the invention of the mouse and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto"&gt;Alto desktop computer design&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, something that helped set the course of modern personal computing. “AR glasses are going to require that to happen. You’re not going to walk around with a keyboard and mouse. You’re not going to be taking out your phone to interact with it.” For some tasks, you might want a simple wristband. For others, you’d want fuller tactile sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpxzSX"&gt;There are still many barriers to producing consumer-ready haptic gloves, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFfniy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With garments in general, we expect them to be washable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TZWL48"&gt;On one hand, the team wants to dramatically increase glove actuator density, going from tens to hundreds or even thousands within a few years. Right now, the gloves can offer a sense of objects’ contours, but not fine distinctions between surfaces — it relies instead on the suggestive power of audio and images. “You could pet a dog, but you wouldn’t feel the texture,” says Reality Labs engineer Katherine Healy. “You need high-density actuation to be able to really get that sensation, and this glove does not do that.” Meta might not be prioritizing something as specific as fur, but it wants to produce more broadly high-quality sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVfjP0"&gt;On the other hand — or more literally, the same hand — the gloves need a dramatic size reduction. Meta’s prototype is svelter than something like a ‘90s Nintendo Power Glove, but that’s not saying much. Healy says the device needs to be light enough that people feel like they can normally interact with the real world as well as the virtual one, and it needs to go fully wireless, rather than relying on a tether like it does now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Meta Reality Labs engineer Katherine Healy with a haptic glove" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3z0lTtV9DK_xG9KLGR3_bqnIfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019166/RL___Kate_Healyscaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V94xtc"&gt;To make things even more complicated, haptic gloves need to fit precisely against wearers’ skin. That could require designing differently fitting versions for each buyer, possibly through a process like 3D knitting, which can &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/08/3d-knitting-weaving-spinning-printing#:~:text=3D%20knitting%20takes%20a%20digital,get%20on%20with%20its%20job."&gt;produce an object of clothing from a custom-sized digital design&lt;/a&gt;. Then there are practical questions like how to clean a high-tech glove — right now, it’s carefully wiped down with alcohol. “With garments in general, we expect them to be washable,” says Healy. “We would love to be able to create a glove that could be washed. How? We don’t know yet. But that’s part of our vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYo3FS"&gt;If the gloves are commercialized, they’ll face the same privacy and security challenges as other wearables that collect biometric information. Abrash compares using technology like EMG wristbands to typing on a keyboard, something that’s rarely described as a potential threat. But wearable technology can analyze people’s physical motion at a fine level, while even basic typing patterns can &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/typing-patterns-diagnose-early-onset-parkinsons-0401"&gt;predict the onset&lt;/a&gt; of diseases like Parkinson’s. Meta will need to establish policies governing how much of that data leaves users’ devices and who else has access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4SBoa6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a new physics where nothing is solid on a large scale”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6pBYdx"&gt;For now, the team is just trying to work out how real is real &lt;em&gt;enough &lt;/em&gt;for VR touch. “One of the interesting things about haptic gloves is that obviously we can’t reproduce reality exactly, which is different from audiovisual stuff,” says Abrash. A super-dense screen could be almost distinguishable from a real image, and a sound wave could capture the sensation of hearing somebody speak. But Meta can’t realistically make a glove that will stop your hand from going through a virtual table. Instead, it has to find the point where you’ll suspend disbelief and accept that the table is there, even if it objectively feels more like jello than hard wood. “There’s a new physics where nothing is solid on a large scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpD5s2"&gt;And as for the dog? “It seems likely to me that if the haptic gloves work out, you’ll be able to pet a dog, but it will be a virtual dog and it will be a slightly different experience,” says Abrash. “But basically — emotionally, experientially — it will feel as real.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10 on Arm will no longer get x64 app emulation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0be2zk_2sHXORm4NZRDWJqvsh5w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150314/akrales_190930_3688_0196.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GRSqmI"&gt;Microsoft started testing x64 emulation for Windows 10 on Arm nearly a year ago, but the company is now limiting the feature to Windows 11. The planned feature allows x64 apps that haven’t been compiled for Arm-powered machines to run, allowing devices like the Surface Pro X to access even more apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omjYY2"&gt;“x64 emulation for Windows is now generally available in Windows 11,” reads an &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/"&gt;update to a Microsoft blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “For those interested in experiencing this, a PC running Windows 11 on Arm is required.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7Mgae"&gt;That means if you were testing the feature on Windows 10, it’s no longer going to ship in any future operating system updates. You’ll need to upgrade a device like a Surface Pro X to Windows 11, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O77AuT"&gt;Microsoft says it’s still committed to “supporting customers on Windows 10 on Arm through October 14, 2025,” but the lack of x64 app emulation will certainly force many on Qualcomm-powered hardware over to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDgopE"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t detailed why it’s decided to drop x64 emulation on Windows 10 on Arm, but the company is also announcing it’s accelerating the rollout of Windows 11 faster than the company previously anticipated. That means even more devices will be eligible for the free upgrade, and hopefully more Arm-powered ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram Live widely releases a new way to support creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vptcq6bM0IEr5iTbOZlmdzfftmg=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150261/250470414_884029085649025_7359683455951696006_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viewers can buy badges, and they’ll appear next to their names in the comments.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LgiE33"&gt;Today, Instagram is officially launching its Badges feature, which gives viewers a way to pay and support creators on Instagram Live. Although the feature has been in testing for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271009/instagram-ads-igtv-live-badges-test-update-creators"&gt;around a year and a half&lt;/a&gt; on an invite-only basis, starting today Instagram will allow any eligible creators on the platform to apply for the feature. Once accepted, viewers will be able to purchase “Badges” during a creator’s livestream to support them financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5xARI"&gt;Badges are available in three different levels, costing $0.99, $1.99, or $4.99, and show up as one, two, or three hearts next to a commenter’s name during a livestream. Any questions or comments posted by a badge owner will be shown more prominently to a creator, and their Instagram name will appear on a list visible to a creator for up to 90 days. Instagram says it won’t take a cut of any revenue paid to creators &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371"&gt;until 2023&lt;/a&gt;, although a &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/2284971015132274"&gt;help page for the feature&lt;/a&gt; notes that Apple or Google take a 30 percent fee for in-app purchases on their respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dd6kMw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instagram won’t take a cut until 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will now update Windows 10 annually with new features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4FthdcC6UMPMBjOkMBfqYm7z8GQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150263/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BPxfRJ"&gt;Microsoft says it’s planning to update Windows 10 annually with any future feature updates. Starting today, Microsoft is releasing the Windows 10 November 2021 update, and the next major update after that will be available later in 2022. This update cadence matches the same used by Windows 11, which will also introduce new features on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOkW34"&gt;“We will transition to a new Windows 10 release cadence to align with the Windows 11 cadence, targeting annual feature update releases,” explains John Cable, Microsoft’s head of Windows servicing and delivery. “The next Windows 10 feature update is slated for the second half of 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgwmyP"&gt;Microsoft’s commitment to future Windows 10 feature updates comes after the company was quiet about its plans during the Windows 11 unveiling earlier this year. It’s still not clear what Microsoft will bring to Windows 10 in the future, though. The November 2021 update is very minor, with the only standout feature for users being GPU compute support in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Microsoft has also already started rolling out the new Microsoft Store to Windows 10 devices earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lG2N6y"&gt;Most of Microsoft’s future Windows plans are understandably for Windows 11, but the company will support at least one version of Windows 10 until October 14th, 2025. We could see two or maybe three feature updates to Windows 10 until its end of support date, but they’re not likely to be significant ones anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCnRZx"&gt;Microsoft is also accelerating its rollout of Windows 11 today. “Based on the positive rollout update experience and user feedback we have seen to date, we are advancing the pace of the rollout faster than we previously anticipated, and now making the Windows 11 upgrade more broadly available to eligible Windows 10 devices,” says Cable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Moon landing will likely be delayed ‘several years’ beyond 2024, auditors say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AoTamz060eVReHBtxFSWCF1rysI=/228x0:6492x4176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150247/51614473753_60838ac103_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Orion spacecraft for NASA’s Artemis I mission lifted above the Space Launch System at Kennedy Space Center&lt;/em&gt; | NASA/Frank Michaux&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hjBBQ0"&gt;Last week, NASA announced that it was bumping back plans to send humans to the Moon from 2024 to 2025, &lt;a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf"&gt;but according to a new report&lt;/a&gt;, the delays could be even more significant. More realistically, such a landing will probably take place several years after 2024, the report claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyCwyd"&gt;The recent prediction comes from NASA’s Office of the Inspector General, which does periodic audits of the space agency’s various programs. In its latest report, the OIG took a comprehensive look at NASA’s Artemis program, the agency’s ambitious initiative to send people back to the Moon, as well as land the first woman and the first person of color on the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbFRIY"&gt;NASA created the Artemis program during the Trump administration. In 2019, then-Vice President Mike Pence challenged NASA with speeding up the program’s timetable in order to land humans on the Moon in just five years. But Pence’s announcement was considered an incredible long shot. NASA’s Artemis program relies on a suite of complicated vehicles all working together to get astronauts safely to the Moon, including a massive new rocket called the Space Launch System, or SLS, that will send people to deep space inside a new crew capsule called Orion. Meanwhile, SpaceX is developing its next-generation spacecraft, called Starship, to carry people to and from the lunar surface for NASA — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;part of a $2.9 billion contract&lt;/a&gt; awarded to the company in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t5KqSH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we project NASA will exceed its current timetable for landing humans on the Moon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGgi58"&gt;However, Starship is still in very early stages of development and has yet to launch to orbit. SLS and Orion also have not flown on their first flight together. The OIG report, released Monday, highlights these issues and reveals just how much work is left to be done on Artemis, making a 2024 landing date unrealistic. “Given the time needed to develop and fully test the HLS and new spacesuits, we project NASA will exceed its current timetable for landing humans on the Moon in late 2024 by several years,” the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DoHP1"&gt;Just last week, NASA also admitted that the 2024 landing date isn’t going to happen. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772427/nasa-artemis-program-moon-lunar-landing-2025-delay"&gt;the agency simply moved the new target to 2025&lt;/a&gt;. NASA blamed the adjustment on various factors including delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in scope to some of the programs, as well as an ongoing lawsuit that stifled development on SpaceX’s lunar lander. Rival space company Blue Origin had also hoped to receive a contract from NASA to develop a lunar lander, but when the space agency gave the award to SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;the company sued in federal court&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit prevented NASA and SpaceX from working together on the lander until the litigation was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrY7Vg"&gt;The OIG report notes that the lawsuit did have an impact on the overall schedule, but the office also argues that the development schedule for SpaceX’s Starship is overly optimistic. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk continues to make bold predictions for Starship’s first major test launch, claiming multiple times it’d be ready to fly to orbit for the first time this year. However, the OIG report estimates the first orbital flight test of Starship will occur sometime in the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJNiDx"&gt;The document does argue that SpaceX may be able to shave off some time due to its speedy testing pace compared with earlier NASA spaceflight programs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But there is still quite a lot of work to be done after Starship’s orbital flight test. Starship’s design relies on the vehicle being refueled while in orbit, in order to have enough propellant to reach the Moon. SpaceX still needs to test out that capability, something it has never done before. Then it will have to do an uncrewed landing before doing one with people on board. All of these milestones, combined with many of the other programs that need to be finished, have the OIG estimating a lunar landing with people sometime in 2026 at the very earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FObm93"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The OIG estimates that NASA will spend $93 billion on Artemis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H0viz8"&gt;It’s not just Starship’s schedule that is off target. The OIG report predicts that the debut of NASA’s SLS rocket and Orion combo will also be delayed. Right now, NASA is working toward a launch as early as February 2022 — a mission called Artemis I that will send the rocket and capsule on a weekslong trip around the Moon without crew on board. However, the Inspector General anticipates that flight will be pushed to summer of 2022 instead. Such a delay would not be unheard of for SLS and Orion, which were originally supposed to fly together as early as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alJbn0"&gt;Perhaps the most shocking finding of the report is the substantial price tag for the major Artemis programs. The OIG estimates that NASA will spend $93 billion on Artemis between 2012 and 2025. And each flight of SLS with Orion on top will cost roughly $4.1 billion. That’s about twice as much as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/the-white-house-puts-a-price-on-the-sls-rocket-and-its-a-lot/"&gt;an estimate from the White House Office of Management and Budget&lt;/a&gt;, which claimed SLS would cost more than $2 billion to fly each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1lB8C"&gt;The OIG report points the finger at how the SLS and Orion are contracted. The vehicles are being built by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, respectively, under a type of contract known as cost-plus. This method allows NASA to have substantial oversight in the development process and continue to provide additional funds to the contractors if things go over budget. Conversely, SpaceX’s Starship is being built through a fixed-price contract; NASA has less oversight through this method and provides one lump sum of money to SpaceX for development, while the company invests its own money to get the vehicle to the finish line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2nsjC"&gt;The OIG notes that using such fixed-price contracts could help NASA save on costs as it strives to send people to the Moon and eventually to Mars. “With the emerging capabilities provided by commercial partners, the Agency may have future options that can help control costs to meet its exploration goals,” the report states. However, without a more realistic schedule, it’ll be difficult to know the true costs and timeframe for the program going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
