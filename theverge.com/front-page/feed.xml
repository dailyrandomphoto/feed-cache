    <title>Apple’s AirPods are on sale again for their lowest price to date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZtjQ8nUeUXb8jxWZ-2HCKGaQVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709202/akrales_190327_3315_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAd3ld"&gt;Apple’s second-gen AirPods are more of a refinement than a revolution, but if you’ve been waiting for the price to come down before jumping on the AirPods bandwagon, now might be the best time to do so. Although they’re often discounted to just shy of $160, Apple’s iconic earbuds and their wireless charging case are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available at Amazon for $130&lt;/a&gt;, the steepest price cut we’ve seen on the in-ears to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klnFI4"&gt;The latest AirPods lack the noise cancellation and flexible design found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, however, they still manage to deliver satisfying sound quality and dependable battery life. Plus, they’re incredibly easy to use with both Apple and Android devices, even if you do lose the double-tap gestures and a bit of convenience with the latter operating system. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="klTSye"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple AirPods update to arrive later this year with iPhone SE refresh coming 2022: report","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XAR7O5"&gt;If you’re a PlayStation gamer, Amazon is currently discounting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a range of PS5 exclusives, along with at least one of Sony’s first-party accessories: the PlayStation HD Camera. The simple black-and-white device is built with streamers in mind, and as such, it features dual 1080p lenses, a built-in stand, and a set of software tools that let you crop your background or remove it entirely if you’re utilizing a green screen. It’s not compatible with the PSVR — Sony &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/09/ps4-games-on-ps5-your-top-questions-answered/"&gt;has confirmed as much&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s still a great way to broadcast yourself alongside your gameplay. Right now, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC5V8L7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $40&lt;/a&gt;, the best price we’ve seen on the Sony peripheral since it launched in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="69ZPv7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10694744"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iG8e1L"&gt;While many of us can understand the appeal of traditional books, there’s no denying the appeal of a device like the Kindle Paperwhite. Amazon’s 10th-gen device is a great way to lug your books around town — whether you own one or 1,000 titles — and comes with a crisp 300ppi, six-inch E Ink panel and support for Audible audiobooks. It’s also waterproof and, unlike most modern devices, lasts for weeks on a single charge, meaning you rarely need to worry about grabbing a power brick before heading out the door. Normally $130,  the 8GB, ad-supported version of the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite---waterproof--ad-supported--10th-generation-%2F-%2FA-75574430"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite is available at Target today for $85&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best deals we’ve encountered on the popular e-reader outside of Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What If...? is a playful expansion of Marvel’s multiverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dnV8hLtOfiaoK9mcP81KveS_0Do=/609x0:3231x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69709092/103_CBA0100_comp_005_v901.1115.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANPggB"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;is the first of its kind in a lot of ways for the MCU. It’s the first animated project in the interconnected web of movies and TV shows that Marvel Studios has been building out for the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i9EIG"&gt;Instead of focusing on a particular character or storyline, &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;is an anthology series that explores different alternative universes and realities that spin off from Marvel’s established films and shows so far. And it works — after years of lore-heavy movies and shows, the animated show is a refreshing and fun break of bite-sized superhero shenanigans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcK46N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What If...?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and the MCU follow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xDdWGdSgXDMHKDc1623T545bRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774268/101_AGA0230_comp_v904_20201218_r709.00001220.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AEBo31"&gt;That flexibility was one of the most exciting things about the series, head writer A.C. Bradley tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;They’re going to let me write all of them?” she recalls reacting when she was offered the show. “Because so often, women get to write the female heroes, and people of color get to write the people of color heroes, while white men get to write anything they want. So the fact that I was actually going to be able to write Doctor Strange and Iron Man and Killmonger — it was a dream come true. And I knew it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9oLAn"&gt;One episode, for example, reimagines &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The First Avenger&lt;/em&gt; with Peggy Carter receiving the Super Solider Serum instead of Steve Rogers; another sees Yondu accidentally nab T’Challa from Wakanda instead of Peter Quill to become Star Lord. Other episodes seen in the trailer show off a world of Marvel zombies, or Iron Man teaming up with &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; villain Killmonger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l85OoU"&gt;It’s one of the biggest benefits of &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s animated format, which allowed for stories to be told without (as much) consideration for locations, CGI effects, actor availability, and the practical laws of physics that constrain live-action shoots. “[Animation] is a little bit more freeing in the sense that we’re gonna go to this location, this location, this location — as long as we manage our time properly enough where we can create and paint and draw those things, design those things, we can do it,” explains &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; director Bryan Andrews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8RfdM"&gt;Some ideas, though, were too far out even for the initial run of &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;. “There was definitely some stuff that was ... way out there,” says Andrews. “Because at first [Marvel Studios] were like, ‘Yeah, go for it, what do you got?’ And we’re like, ‘Here,’ and they’re like, ‘Yeah, this is all awesome... Some of these maybe we can do later?’” The goal for the first season, he explains, was to try to keep things within the ballpark of the existing MCU. “They just wanted to play it a little bit closer-ish, you know, spinning off moments that we clearly know or can recognize.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mAyAYIuHZQLuz_tdaGTWVpvK1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774269/101_AKA0380_comp_v001.1028.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pHbCyt"&gt;One thing that fans won’t see in &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; — at least for now — is any of the multiversal fallout after Loki and Sylvie’s actions in the season finale of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. That’s for two reasons. The most practical is the fact that &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;actually started production before Loki did, thanks to the longer runway for animation. But the creative team also wanted to avoid tying down the new series too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6d3fs"&gt;“Early on, we had a couple of meetings to talk about what the rules of the multiverse will be,” Bradley explains. “I kind of took a step back and was like, I’m just gonna have fun. I’m not going to write any rules that’re going to step on the TVA. We’re not going to have, you know, The Watcher hanging out with Morbius just yet. We’re just going to show both Marvel and the fans all the weird and wild places that the multiverse can go and just get them excited for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ohCia"&gt;That doesn’t mean that &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt; and its alternate-universe takes on classic characters like Captain Carter might not appear in future live-action Marvel projects down the line. “That [decision] belongs to someone with a bigger paycheck,” Bradley jokes. “It’d be cool,” Andrews adds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TG6J8Lh36EOBQTKBub0ntWAFWyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22774270/104_EGA0160_comp_v003.1057.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5RZcni"&gt;But even if &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s characters don’t immediately pop up in an upcoming movie or &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;episode, it’ll have an impact on the broader MCU no matter what. Andrews mentioned that the &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; team took a look at &lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;’s take on the character as the live-action film was being developed. “And maybe they were a little bit inspired,” says Andrews. “I like to think that they were.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmJZLw"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; starts streaming today on Disney Plus. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now obeying India’s new internet rules, government tells court</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GmWIw3VJamtEvdOKaSt3eA_xNgk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69708732/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1wDpr4"&gt;Twitter is now complying with the Indian government’s new internet rules, a lawyer representing the federal government has told a court in Delhi, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/india-says-twitter-has-now-complied-with-new-internet-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The social media company has now appointed a permanent employee to serve as both chief compliance officer and grievance officer, as well as a nodal officer — three roles required under the new legislation &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter said it appointed the executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614205/twitter-appoints-grievance-compliance-officer-comply-india-rules"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqGMzt"&gt;Although rivals Google and Facebook have reportedly been in compliance &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/facebook-whatsapp-google-and-other-internet-giants-comply-with-indias-it-rules/"&gt;since May&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter has found itself in a tense standoff with the Indian government over the legislation. In June, the government warned Twitter of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it failed to obey the new rules, and the following month it argued that the social media network had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;lost its legal immunity for its users’ posts&lt;/a&gt; because of its non-compliance. Later that month, Delhi’s high court took issue with Twitter’s attempt to fill two of the legally required positions &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/total-non-compliance-by-twitter-hc/articleshow/84845519.cms"&gt;through a third-party contractor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WehoUm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Government previously said Twitter had lost legal immunity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2viGqA"&gt;The Indian government has also been unhappy with Twitter’s moderation policies. In May, police in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided the social media company’s offices&lt;/a&gt; after it labelled a tweet from a government official as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447379/twitter-india-covid19-politician-tweets-manipulated-media"&gt;manipulated media.&lt;/a&gt;” However, Twitter has been complying with other moderation requests from the government. It suspended over 500 accounts and reduced the visibility of some hashtags &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, some with links to the farmers’ protests, in response to legal threats, and has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;censored tweets critical of India’s handling of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1Ahqx"&gt;While Twitter is now obeying the rules, Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging service has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;sued the Indian government&lt;/a&gt; over parts of the legislation. It objects to a requirement that it trace the origin of messages on its platform, arguing that this is unconstitutional, and will “severely undermine the privacy” of its users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Norton and Avast are merging into an $8 billion antivirus empire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZMEPJQrdmWDkSfQMiA1UzD37hY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69708634/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xbRPab"&gt;NortonLifeLock and Avast are merging in a deal worth more than $8 billion. The deal will see NortonLifelock acquire all of Avast’s shares, and create a much larger cyber security firm. “With this combination, we can strengthen our cyber safety platform and make it available to more than 500 million users,” &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210810005994/en/"&gt;says Vincent Pilette&lt;/a&gt;, NortonLifeLock CEO. “We will also have the ability to further accelerate innovation to transform cyber safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWBoEL"&gt;The combination should lead to antivirus products that include the benefits of Avast’s focus on privacy and NortonLifeLock’s experience in identity, all at a time when cyber security is critical for both consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvVjZ2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;Ransomware is on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, with new high profile cases occurring on what feels like a weekly basis. Gigabyte was hit by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616882/gigabyte-technologies-ransomware-attack-data-leak-112-gb-ransomexx"&gt;ransomware attack earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and a large ransomware attack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;affected customers of Kaseya’s&lt;/a&gt; remote IT management software last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uTt7w"&gt;These attacks can often lead to supply chain attacks, ransomware incidents, or malware that affects regular consumers, too. Hackers managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16325202/ccleaner-hack-malware-security"&gt;hide malware inside system cleaner utility CCleaner in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and consumers are often the victims when databases of credit cards and personal information are leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVIRXN"&gt;Avast, which was founded in the Czech Republic, has been creating software for consumers and small businesses for 11 years, and acquired AVG five years ago. NortonLifeLock is the former consumer side of Symantec, which was left behind after Broadcom acquired Symantec’s enterprise security business two years ago. Norton antivirus has existed in various forms since 1991, and has remained a popular option for consumers for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Amiga is the latest game system to get a mini retro remake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4VcZtI2Y4xYKQwGFkc4pDJ0YNA=/1x0:1600x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69708448/a500.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6aYalQ"&gt;Commodore’s Amiga 500, a home computer that became a popular game system, is receiving a remake. The &lt;a href="https://retrogames.biz/thea500-mini"&gt;A500 Mini&lt;/a&gt; is being developed by Retro Games Ltd, which &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/23/17605438/c64-mini-thec64-mini-release-date-us"&gt;previously released&lt;/a&gt; a mini version of the Commodore 64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV2lOo"&gt;The Amiga 500 was the most successful model in the Amiga family of PCs, which started to appear in the mid-’80s and drew a devoted following as gaming systems, particularly in Europe. While the A500 Mini is clearly based on the Amiga 500, Retro Games Ltd says it’ll also emulate the more powerful AGA graphics hardware from the Amiga 1200. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EUoLG-pANmaGcjyGKRs07r8jApc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775518/a500.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K2hD5V"&gt;The list of games confirmed so far includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xb0vBy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alien Breed 3D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KFw8YE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P3YDVd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ATR: All Terrain Racing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E98kb7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battle Chess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VxIABu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cadaver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QVExxs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kick Off 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mpp2xY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinball Dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JLQro2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simon the Sorcerer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X5obsC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xFFpWi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chaos Engine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ywMl7P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worms: The Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gMgln4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OF29Er"&gt;There’ll be 25 included in total, and you’ll also be able to add more yourself with WHDLoad, an installation package for Amiga software. Other system functions include the ability to switch between 50Hz and 60Hz screen refresh rate, save states, a built-in CRT filter, and various scaling options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvkDvB"&gt;The A500 Mini comes with a two-button USB mouse that is already making my hand cramp up with nostalgia, as well as a gamepad reminiscent of the one from the CD32, an ill-fated attempt to convert the Amiga into a traditional game console. The keyboard on the case is sadly not functional, but you can hook up your own over USB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVhbCE"&gt;Retro Games Ltd will release the A500 Mini early next year. It’ll cost $139.99 in the US and £119.99 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now Microsoft is protesting after Amazon won a $10 billion NSA cloud contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-CRIME-INTELLIGENCE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2m5A3tRsQN8alFnCichIkPPBHpU=/53x0:3370x2211/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69708150/918218262.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oKWnGV"&gt;After spending years battling over the Defense Department’s $10 billion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565281/pentagon-microsoft-jedi-amazon"&gt;JEDI cloud services contract&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft and Amazon are fighting over another government deal. Now it’s the National Security Agency offering a contract that could pay up to $10 billion as it shifts away from on-premises servers to a commercial provider. However, as &lt;a href="https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/07/nsa-cloud-protest.aspx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported first, this time around, Amazon Web Services won the $10 billion contest, and it’s Microsoft’s turn to &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/docket/b-420004.1"&gt;file a protest&lt;/a&gt; with the Government Accountability Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXYTO4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Technology &lt;/em&gt;reports that Microsoft’s claim is the NSA didn’t conduct a proper evaluation while considering a provider for its new project, code-named WildandStormy. In a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/08/nsa-awards-secret-10-billion-contract-amazon/184390/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NextGov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an NSA spokesperson confirmed the award and protests, saying, “The Agency will respond to the protest in accordance with appropriate federal regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="um5iKq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A decision is due by October 29th&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OPaZBi"&gt;The NSA is pursuing a “Hybrid Compute Initiative” to meet its processing and analytical requirements while also holding onto intelligence data (although it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20965354/nsa-intelligence-no-warrant-phone-location-data-collection"&gt;might not need as much storage as it used to&lt;/a&gt;). AWS already holds many government cloud contracts, but the JEDI process revealed Microsoft as a formidable competitor. Last year the CIA split up its  Commercial Cloud Enterprise contract between five companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Oracle, and IBM. Last year, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fthe-broadest-range-of-cloud-innovation-across-us-government-data-classifications%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22618764%2Fnsa-10-billion-microsoft-aws-cloud-services-protest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Microsoft blog post&lt;/a&gt; said it was pursuing US government accreditation for its Azure Government Top Secret regions to “meet the demand for greater agility in the classified space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1g9FN"&gt;When Amazon was pushing for a review of the JEDI contract process, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20940040/amazon-jedi-pentagon-contract-microsoft-trump"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; “errors and unmistakable bias,” as former president Donald Trump reportedly stepped in, bringing his animosity toward then-CEO Jeff Bezos. Eventually, the DoD decided the program’s design no longer met its needs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565281/pentagon-microsoft-jedi-amazon"&gt;scrapped the entire plan&lt;/a&gt; to pursue a multi-vendor solution called &lt;a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/inside-dods-jedi-replacement-the-joint-warfighter-cloud-capability/"&gt;Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability&lt;/a&gt;. Will WildandStormy meet a similar fate? A step toward an answer will come within the next couple of months, as the GAO’s decision is due by October 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile has started offering fiber home internet in a limited pilot program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vT_c0K0JAGHHPLfi_RTmlJM-YWw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69707786/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company is exploring adding fiber as a complement to its fixed wireless home internet offering.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y5antk"&gt;T-Mobile has quietly started selling fiber-based home internet, &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/08/t-mobile-is-launching-fiber-optic-home-internet-starting-in-nyc/"&gt;as tipped to &lt;em&gt;T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by the company to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. T-Mobile says it’s testing fiber optic internet in certain residential buildings in Manhattan as a complement to its fixed wireless offering, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;made available to the public in April&lt;/a&gt;. The company isn’t deploying an entirely new fiber network for the pilot; it’s running on a local provider’s fiber lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hszq4y"&gt;Details on &lt;a href="https://t-mobilefiber.com"&gt;the dedicated T-Mobile Fiber site&lt;/a&gt; are thin, but it claims the service offers 940Mbps upload and download speeds. A Wi-Fi 6 router is included, along with chat and e-mail customer support for fiber customers. A T-Mobile rep had no other details to share with us, just that the program is a “very limited pilot” and more information would be shared “when and if” it becomes more widely available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qDOhdw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iLFnwk"&gt;T-Mobile has some ambitious plans for home internet. As the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;tried to convince regulators to let it buy Sprint&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, it argued that it would be able to offer competitive wireless home internet with the acquired spectrum. With the deal done, T-Mobile began a pilot program that included 100,000 households by the time it opened up to the general public. On a call with investors last week, the company said it was on track to meet its goal of 500,000 home internet customers by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34z6lX"&gt;It’s not clear how big of a role T-Mobile thinks fiber could play in its home internet plans, but it certainly seems to think it’s worth testing the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BitMEX crypto exchange agrees to pay $100 million to get financial regulators off its back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/arH6LMa_aPH8zLZlzGBExrgmdCs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69707718/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VPBJqN"&gt;Cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX has agreed to pay a $100 million civil penalty as part of a settlement with the &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8412-21"&gt;US Commodity Futures Trading Commission&lt;/a&gt; (CFTC) and the &lt;a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-100-million-enforcement-action-against-unregistered-futures"&gt;Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&lt;/a&gt; (FinCEN), &lt;a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/bitmex-confirms-it-has-reached-settlements-with-cftc-and-fincen/"&gt;the company announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The fine addresses charges that the derivatives exchange allowed illegal trades and violated anti-money laundering laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7D6E5g"&gt;BitMEX didn't address the less savory uses of its platform for years, as FinCEN says the company “willfully failed to comply with its obligations under the BSA (Bank Secrecy Act).”  According to the organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vb5GW2"&gt;For over six years, BitMEX failed to implement and maintain a compliant anti-money laundering program and a customer identification program, and it failed to report certain suspicious activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mV5gX0"&gt;FinCEN claims those issues exposed other financial entities to unnecessary risk due to the company’s unwillingness to collect more than an email address from traders from 2014 to 2020. Worse, BitMEX senior leadership deliberately altered customer information to hide customer’s true location, FinCEN claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDlstd"&gt;The probe into BitMEX started in 2020 with a charge from &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8270-20"&gt;the CFTC and the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; that BitMEX and its founders were running the exchange outside of the US and “unlawfully accepting orders and funds from U.S. customers to trade cryptocurrencies, including derivatives on bitcoin, ether, and litecoin,” the CFTC wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JgGedI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting investigated by the government is good, actually&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SFkPf"&gt;BitMEX’s announcement that it would pay didn’t confirm CFTC’s claims or FinCEN’s concerns over the BSA, nor did it address &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/bitmex-founders-and-executives-are-indicted-in-new-york?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;the criminal charges against BitMEX’s original three founders&lt;/a&gt;. Everything is apparently fine at BitMEX though, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/crypto-is-changing-and-bitmex-is-changing-with-it/"&gt;CEO Alexander Höptner&lt;/a&gt;. “Putting this legal matter with the CFTC and FinCEN behind us will only accelerate our evolution, and puts us firmly on the right path,” Höptner writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNE1Eh"&gt;As part of the settlement, the company will be forced to bring on an independent consultant to analyze its transactions and review its policies and procedures. It doesn’t seems like BitMEX has a choice but to be on the “right path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w5MMB"&gt;The resolution to BitMEX’s tussle with regulators is just the latest example of the US government’s growing focus on regulating cryptocurrencies. BitMEX’s “sin” of obscuring transactions is in the process of being addressed with even more permanent action. FinCEN &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;has proposed regulations&lt;/a&gt; for crypto wallets that would require identities to be tied to transactions of certain sizes, and members of the US Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608096/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-sec-gary-gensler-regulation"&gt;have called for even more power&lt;/a&gt; to regulate crypto trading. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="wFktqI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford’s F-150 was hit&lt;/a&gt; by the global semiconductor shortage, and now its flagship Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle is seeing a serious delay too — by a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; of six weeks for prospective owners who were scheduled to get their vehicle between July 5th and October 1st. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/6-week-delay-email-going-out-soon-to-mach-e-order-holders-with-production-from-july-5-october-1.8520/"&gt;according to emails&lt;/a&gt; Ford sent to buyers today (&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/10/ford-delays-mach-e-orders-by-6-weeks-due-to-chip-shortage-gives-250kwh-free-charging/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lh6OCG"&gt;It’s not the first delay for the Mustang Mach-E, either, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;after Ford held back some 4,500 cars in March&lt;/a&gt; for unspecified quality checks, and Ford’s handling this delay in much the same way, giving owners an additional 250kWh of free charging at stations in the company’s FordPass Charging Network. That’s on top of the 250kWh they were already going to receive for purchasing the vehicle. Since the Mach-E has a usable battery capacity of between 68kWh and 88kWh, we’re talking about roughly three free fill-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qobqd3"&gt;Some of the very first Mach-E vehicles also reportedly saw their deliveries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/16/22234668/ford-delays-deliveries-mustang-mach-e-quality-checks"&gt;pushed back by a month in January&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22513435/ford-mustang-mach-delivery-delay-uk-ecall"&gt;UK deliveries were paused&lt;/a&gt; due to a safety risk in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2jPeG"&gt;You can read our previews of the Mach-E at the links below.&lt;/p&gt;

All sorts of gadgets are affected, including graphics cards and game consoles, but automakers have been hit particularly hard. Some car companies have gotten creative, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;dropping features like wireless charging, HD radio and start-stop&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewriting their own software&lt;/a&gt; for chips that are easier to obtain than the originals.&lt;/p&gt;
