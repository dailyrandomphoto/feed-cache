    <title>Meta ordered to sell Giphy by UK regulator</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wqzei8"&gt;The UK’s competition regulator has officially ruled that Facebook parent company Meta’s acquisition of Giphy should be unwound, a year and a half after the social media giant first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;said it was acquiring the popular GIF-making and sharing website&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that it had come to the decision after its investigation found an acquisition could harm competition between social media platforms, and that its concerns “can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="reO12V"&gt;The CMA said the acquisition could be used to deny or limit other platforms’ access to Giphy GIFs and drive more traffic to Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. It also raised concerns that it could be used to require other platforms to provide more data to access the GIFs. Finally, the CMA also believes that Giphy’s advertising services could have competed with Meta’s, but that these were shuttered as a result of the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KgFRr3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfNIeA"&gt;“The tie-up between Facebook and Giphy has already removed a potential challenger in the display advertising market,” the chair of the independent inquiry group Stuart McIntosh said in a statement, referring to Meta. “Without action, it will also allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors’ access to Giphy GIFs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OumhaB"&gt;“By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,” McInosh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU8im6"&gt;This would be the first time the CMA has attempted to unwind a completed acquisition by a tech giant, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/662c8e3f-4909-4bec-9131-c0237bb4897d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. Although Meta may appeal the decision, the UK regulator’s decision sets a notable precedent for future big tech purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8S81H"&gt;While groundbreaking, the CMA’s decision doesn’t come as a complete surprise after it’s preliminary findings report from August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621957/facebook-giphy-deal-blocked-uk-regulator"&gt;said the deal should be unwound&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gP7n3z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve directed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to sell Giphy after finding the takeover could reduce competition between social media platforms and increase Facebook’s already significant market power. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yRaPxMR43z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yRaPxMR43z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Competition &amp;amp; Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1465624517393489920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9muxf6"&gt;Responding to the decision, Meta’s EU director of policy communications Robin Koch, said that the company is considering all its options, including appeal. “Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources,” Koch said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy’s product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUDU4C"&gt;Meta has also previously disputed the CMA’s competition concerns, and has suggested that there was never a chance of Giphy’s advertising business becoming a viable competitor. In response to the regulator’s investigation, the company argued that Giphy had “no meaningful audience of its own,” and when it announced the acquisition, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-giphy/"&gt;Meta said&lt;/a&gt; that it provided 50 percent of all of Giphy’s traffic. It also said “developers and API partners will continue to have the same access to Giphy’s APIs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz3IGg"&gt;Responding to the CMA’s provisional findings, Meta argued that the regulator was “sending a chilling message to start-up entrepreneurs: do not build new companies because you will not be able to sell them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5iAO1"&gt;Although Meta pledged to work with the CMA on its investigation, the regulator recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736236/facebook-giphy-uk-cma-fine"&gt;fined the company £50 million ($70 million)&lt;/a&gt; for failing to comply with the terms of its initial enforcement order. The regulator said Meta was “consciously refusing to report all the required information” about its compliance with the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eH0f"&gt;Giphy had raised $150 million in funding since its founding, but it had yet to turn a profit prior to its acquisition and was reportedly running out of money. Its sale price to Meta was believed to have been $400 million, which was less than a previous valuation given to it by investors, and a sign of its financial trouble. While the CMA’s investigation has been ongoing, Giphy’s 100 plus employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621957/facebook-giphy-deal-blocked-uk-regulator#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Giphy%E2%80%99s%20more,with%20the%20arrangement."&gt;haven’t been able to become full Meta employees&lt;/a&gt;, although Meta has reportedly been paying the company’s bills to keep it running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPX6mR"&gt;The CMA’s investigation is part of a wider wave of scrutiny being paid to tech acquisitions in recent years, and sits in stark contrast to when Meta was able to buy upstarts like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus with relatively little challenge. Multiple regulators, &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4021"&gt;including the EU&lt;/a&gt;, have opened investigations into &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-nears-purchase-of-startup-in-deal-that-values-it-at-1-billion-11606750196"&gt;Meta’s acquisition of Kustomer&lt;/a&gt;, a customer services platform for businesses. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634379/nvidia-arm-aquisition-delay-uk-phase-2-investigation"&gt;CMA has also raised objections&lt;/a&gt; to Nvidia’s purchase of chip designed Arm, another acquisition that’s attracted a lot of antitrust scrutiny from regulators around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CFCfy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 30th, 5:35AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Meta’s statement. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FIFA is trialling limb-tracking tech to catch offside players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Norwich City v Southampton - Premier League" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8A2CgmGLfPTNhYxr_KfpIOxQhWE=/0x0:3911x2607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70208344/1354502318.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7niqXd"&gt;FIFA, the global governing body of the sport variously known as football and soccer, is trialling new technology that tracks players’ limbs to detect whether they’re in an offside position. The system will be employed at the 2021 Arab Cup, which kicks off today in Qatar, the host of next year’s World Cup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu0g07"&gt;FIFA calls the system “&lt;a href="https://www.fifa.com/news/semi-automated-offside-technology-explained-ahead-of-fifa-arab-cup"&gt;semi-automatic offside technology.&lt;/a&gt;” It involves a camera setup installed on the roof of the stadium, with limb data extracted from the video and sent to the match officials’ operating room so the offside line can be calculated in real time. The BBC &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59461288"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that 10 to 12 cameras collect up to 29 data points for each player 50 times a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="05MtoA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Semi-automated offside technology explained ahead of FIFA Arab Cup. Pierluigi Collina and Johannes Holzmüller explain the advancement of the tests to date. This technology will be tested at the FIFA Arab Cup 2021™ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFArabCup?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FIFArabCup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FootballTechnology?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FootballTechnology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/A6Bef8f25A"&gt;https://t.co/A6Bef8f25A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/A63xwvYZTC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A63xwvYZTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FIFA Media (@fifamedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fifamedia/status/1465263593868382209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6KT8WX"&gt;In soccer, a player is offside if the ball is passed to them with fewer than two opposing players (usually including the goalkeeper) between them and the goal line. It’s a critical rule that often leads to disallowed goals, but it can be difficult for referees to make the right decision in real time, and the limitations of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) technology have only added to the controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS9OUo"&gt;Currently, VAR involves analyzing a video feed and drawing lines on the pitch to confirm whether players are offside, but the footage doesn’t always have the resolution or the frame rate to determine the exact moment the ball leaves a player’s foot, for example. It can be frustrating to watch a match and wait multiple minutes after a seemingly legitimate goal to  find out whether it’ll be canceled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65OsW7"&gt;“VAR has had a very positive impact in football and the number of major mistakes is reduced, but there are areas where it can be improved - and offside is one of them,” FIFA”s chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina tells the BBC. “We are aware the process to check offsides can take longer [than other decisions], especially when it is very tight. We are also aware that the positioning of the lines may not be 100-percent accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHJRjR"&gt;If the tests at the Arab Cup are successful, the system may be used at next year’s World Cup, according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Many T-Mobile customers report they can’t call Verizon, AT&amp;T, or other T-Mobile numbers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8VCvk2"&gt;T-Mobile customers have been reporting issues making and receiving calls all afternoon, with problems frequently linked to Verizon numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nrdSdS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon and T-Mobile both say their networks weren’t at fault&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ddNNO"&gt;This all started around 2PM ET this afternoon, with hotspots showing in most major metro areas on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdectector&lt;/a&gt;. Initial reports suggested Verizon might be having issues, but Verizon spokesperson Kevin King tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its network is operating “business as usual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCDgao"&gt;T-Mobile declined to provide a quote from a named spokesperson, but a representative sent the following message from the company’s media relations address: “We have no indication that this is a T-Mobile network issue but we have taken steps to reroute our customers and have been in close contact with Verizon throughout the day as they work to resolve this. We apologize to any customers who were impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8wFwb0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;User reports indicate T-Mobile is having problems since 1:49 PM EST. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LExjRid785"&gt;https://t.co/LExjRid785&lt;/a&gt; RT if you're also having problems &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TMobiledown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TMobiledown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Downdetector (@downdetector) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/downdetector/status/1465392459878473745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

The reported problems range from instantly dropped calls, to “all circuits are busy” messages, to lag even when people are able to get a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHG3kC"&gt;A test call between one T-Mobile prepaid number and a Verizon number worked for us, but posts across social media continue to note issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDPT6G"&gt;We haven’t seen widespread reports of AT&amp;amp;T issues, other than from T-Mobile customers who are having problems calling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4NUP8"&gt;It’s still unclear precisely what was causing the issues, or even who felt its impact. However, as T-Mobile indicated, by later in the evening the number of reported issues dropped sharply and things seem to be returning to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2jyzK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 29th, 11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from T-Mobile and notes that the issue seems to be going away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes says Theranos’ former president abused her</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TEl-vEwtk1rZacOcpMeRG4SZRCw=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207844/1236751861.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;“I have molded you,” Sunny Balwani texted&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Mb8lDg"&gt;Today, Elizabeth Holmes cried on the stand as she recounted being raped at Stanford. It was part of the reason she dropped out of college, she testified. “I decided I was going to build a life by building this company,” she said on the witness stand today. When she started dating Sunny Balwani, her co-defendant who is being tried separately, “he said I was safe now that I had met him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owoBqn"&gt;Then, she said, he abused and raped her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUxhSQ"&gt;Holmes, the former CEO of Theranos, is standing trial for 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Recordings of Holmes lying to investors and journalists have been played to the courtroom. Since the opening statements, we knew she was going to try to shift blame &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; onto Balwani, the company’s former president. Balwani’s lawyer has previously contested Holmes’ allegations of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lqT44e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A monkey trying to fly a spaceship.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXwyxr"&gt;Witnesses earlier in the trial said that they saw Balwani defer to Holmes. They also said that in meetings where both were present, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;Holmes did most of the talking&lt;/a&gt; and ran the meetings. James Mattis, a former Theranos board member, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;testified that Holmes was “in charge”&lt;/a&gt; of Theranos. Lisa Peterson, who worked on the DeVos investment in Theranos, said her team didn’t do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;comprehensive research on Theranos &lt;/a&gt;because they didn’t want to “upset Elizabeth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkP3Se"&gt;Holmes said today that Balwani controlled her behind the scenes: what she ate, how she dressed, and how she talked. She claimed he texted her while they were in meetings together to criticize her. We saw a document in what Holmes identified as Balwani’s handwriting that she said contained instructions for her. He told her she was like “a monkey trying to fly a spaceship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlm0Be"&gt;Balwani met Holmes when she was 18. He was 37. She understood he was successful, that he’d worked with Bill Gates at Microsoft. When she went to Stanford, they kept in touch via email. In March 2004, Holmes dropped out of school. She said she spoke to Balwani about making a business out of a patent application she’d filed. She moved in with him in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtU5jo"&gt;Holmes didn’t put an exact date on the beginning of the alleged abuse. But Balwani “told me that I didn’t know what I was doing in business, that my convictions were wrong, that he was astonished at my mediocrity and if I followed my instincts I was going to fail,” she claimed. He said that “who I was was never going to be a person who would succeed in life or in business, so I needed to kill that person and become a new Elizabeth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="INwEcS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will never meet with anyone (direct report especially) for more than five minutes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UDt1r0"&gt;If she wanted to be a successful entrepreneur, Balwani told her, then Holmes needed to spend all her time on the business, and only spend time with people who would make the business successful, she said. “I needed to be working seven days a week and be in the office seven days a week.” This meant spending less time with her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viWMrI"&gt;Holmes’ lawyer moved into evidence a bizarre handwritten document. Holmes said she recognized the handwriting as Balwani’s. (It was distinctive, particularly around the capital letter “I.”) The document contained instructions such as, “Every morning I will force myself out of bed and spend 30 minutes+ (never a minute less) to write what I want from my day. I will only spend time on things that are most important to cash flow…” and “I will never meet with anyone (direct report especially) for more than five minutes unless I have written down why… my focus is on how they will serve the company more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8BDNG"&gt;Another page of the document was titled “Pursuit of Success in Business.” The idea of this page was that some people are naturally successful at business, but those who aren’t can learn “by using their intellect and develop the ‘natural instinct.’” The most important thing was discipline. The second most-important thing was “self-discovering through WRITING (not reading.)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pc2TOU"&gt;“He was talking about me,” Holmes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xAal1P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He was so disappointed in my mediocrity and he was trying to teach me how to be better.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0UgROM"&gt;Then we saw a schedule Holmes had drawn up for herself on what appeared to be hotel stationery for a hotel in Singapore called Raffles. The first item on her schedule, at 4AM, was to “rise &amp;amp; thank God most things are not logical.” Then, from 4 to 4:15, she was to “wish for change.” It also noted her lunch, tofu with tabbouleh and “green drink.” Below the schedule were a series of notes to herself that Holmes said were Balwani’s precepts: “I do everything I say, word for word” and “I show no excitement… calm, direct, pointed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEnu1w"&gt;Holmes said on the stand that when she didn’t do what Balwani wanted, he “would get very angry with me and would yell at me about the fact that he was so disappointed in my mediocrity and he was trying to teach me how to be better and I wasn’t listening to him and I was never going to be successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eu7qqD"&gt;When she &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; successful, Balwani took credit: “I have molded you,” he texted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqaeVh"&gt;The defense showed a document Holmes created on her iPhone, where she said she had written down what Balwani had been yelling at her: “I don’t enjoy being in a company that’s not going to win. I don’t have the faith. So angry at myself for coming. So angry spent [sic] 5 years of my life. Biggest failure of my life. Regret coming. Stayed because I love you... Fucking mediocre quality of this piece of shit company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qq37j1"&gt;Holmes said the abuse wasn’t just emotional. Balwani would “force me to have sex with him even when I didn’t want to because he wanted me to know he still loved me,” she said. According to Holmes, she wrote another document on her iPhone after one of these incidents: “Don’t enjoy literally anything about it or who I am if I did it. Hurts so much. So so much. Can’t focus on anything except why? Why hurting myself? Can’t even move let alone do sit-ups or actually sit up. Lying swollen. Literally.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KV180g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He impacted everything about who I was and I don’t fully understand that.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4aDwF"&gt;What had broken Balwani’s spell, Holmes testified, was a report from a lab inspection in 2015. “I had gone into that inspection thinking that we had one of the best labs in the world.” She got the report in 2016, and it said that Theranos’ operations posed “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/10888956/theranos-lab-inspection-cms-newark-quality-control-personnel"&gt;immediate jeopardy to patient safety&lt;/a&gt;.” After that, to Balwani’s dismay, she hired lab directors that reported to her, and got outside advisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqbA2Y"&gt;Holmes said that Balwani left the company shortly after, in May 2016, and that she didn’t continue her personal relationship with him past that. While he was on a business trip in Thailand, she and her brother secretly moved her things out of Balwani’s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVtcls"&gt;Balwani did not tell her what to tell investors, journalists, or anyone else about Theranos, she said. When her attorney, Kevin Downey, asked how Balwani had affected her work at Theranos, she replied, “I don’t know. He impacted everything about who I was and I don’t fully understand that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luUCns"&gt;The objective of this testimony seems to be to introduce evidence about Holmes’s state of mind. For the wire fraud charges to stick, the government has to show that Holmes was knowingly lying. But if she believed she was telling the truth — or she was somehow rendered incompetent to judge what the truth was — the prosecution’s case falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="m16WbQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A motive of love.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dXpybv"&gt;Holmes’ lawyers have tried to get sections of a prior deposition from Balwani admitted as evidence in this case, because they say his lawyers told them he would plead the Fifth. The prosecution contested this and, as part of their argument, claimed that his statements from the deposition aren’t admissible because of “a motive of love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kthF1q"&gt;Attached to the prosecution’s motion were texts from Holmes in May 2016 in which she said to Balwani, “I adore you.” In June 2016, after Holmes said she’d sneakily moved out of their house, Balwani texted her, “I know what you are thinking and going thru. [sic] Control your thoughts and don’t let fear control you. Breathe and in every hour be conscious of your breath and breath [sic] out fear.” Holmes replied, “I love this.” According to the government, this is evidence that their romantic relationship persisted after Balwani left Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niTzSF"&gt;Holmes will have to explain how those texts fit with the testimony she gave today. That testimony also differs from what she told the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2017. She said that the relationship had “died” before Balwani left Theranos. She also said in 2017 that she was “the ultimate decision maker for the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="X7h3eS"&gt;I expect that the prosecution will ask her about all this tomorrow — her direct examination ended just as the day in court did.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uocVGt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; isn’t over yet, even if some deals are becoming more difficult to find. We’ve adapted our coverage to make sure that you’re only seeing the latest and best deals on tech that you want — and that we recommend — whether you’re on the hunt for a pair of wireless earbuds, a 4K TV, games, phones, or something else entirely. The occasional Nerf blaster might find its way in here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGdVSU"&gt;If you’re hoping to get the majority of your holiday shopping done ahead of mid-December, now is a good time to do that. However, don’t despair if something you’re looking for is no longer available, or isn’t on sale for cheap as you would like. December always brings more deals, and we’ll do our best to give you every opportunity to score on tech deals before the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQO61y"&gt;Keep a lookout for the latest deals surfacing at the top of this page, many of which are set to expire when the clock strikes midnight on the West Coast. And if you don’t want the deal suggestions to stop, head over to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to our &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zkolIm"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="UL3Jvt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10893279"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lyTVGI"&gt;Ikea’s Symfonisk picture frame speaker is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-black-40487320%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22796651%2Fcyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Ikea for $149&lt;/a&gt;, the first significant discount we’ve seen on collaboration since it came out (discount applies at checkout). The unique speaker offers good, full sound thanks to a built-in Sonos speaker, one that’s as capable as a Sonos One. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Bm7714"&gt;BioLite’s portable FirePit Plus — which cuts back on smoke, functions as a grill, and fans the flames via a large battery pack and built-in fan — is on sale for $188 ($62 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BCTC22X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;amp;website_id=0f9b0f6f-13ac-4498-8e0f-b3beae765e07&amp;amp;url=https://www.rei.com/product/189288/biolite-firepit&amp;amp;ctc=___vg__p_22516597__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;REI right now&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6O5W6j"&gt;Sideclick’s Universal Remote Attachment adds more functionality to your Roku streaming player remote and makes it possible to control Blu-ray players, soundbars, TVs, and more with a single remote. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6ClVNXH9M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can buy it for $15&lt;/a&gt; instead of $30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="y13e7A"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7 is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-11-inch-Android-Bluetooth-Charging/dp/B08FBN5STQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $500&lt;/a&gt; ($150 off), the Android tablet’s best price to date. The 11-inch slate has its faults — namely on the software front — but it still offers speedy performance, excellent speakers, and a display that renders it a terrific device for watching movies or consuming other media. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ftv1Jp"&gt;Apple’s midrange wearable, the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7m1QaQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, is on sale at Target in the 40mm configuration for $220 instead of $280 when you pick it up from select local stores. The Apple Watch SE serves as a step up from the Series 3, with features and a design similar to more recent flagships. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Emk278"&gt;RAVPower is taking 35 percent off several of its chargers when you use various promo codes. You can, for instance, buy this &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2Fproducts%2Frp-pc150-2-pack-20w-usb-c-pd-wall-charger%3Fvariant%3D33008876912715&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22796651%2Fcyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$28 two-pack of 20W chargers for $13&lt;/a&gt; when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;RT50&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2Fproducts%2Frp-pb232-90w-2-port-pd-3-0-qc-3-0-power-bank%3Fvariant%3D39402579558475&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22796651%2Fcyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this 90W battery bank for $58 instead of $89&lt;/a&gt; with the code &lt;strong&gt;CM35&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="cUK4zQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733790"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q7Z0dX"&gt;Sony’s A8H 65-inch OLED is $1,500 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6txIXGhYS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (originally $2,499). While it lacks some features necessary for gaming at fast refresh rates, it’s a great model if you watch a lot of movies and TV shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H8c3BI"&gt;The myQ Chamberlain smart garage door controller is cheaper than ever for Cyber Monday. Around $20 was its previous best price, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GD3D9YJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has it for $17.&lt;/a&gt; This model supports &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Key-In-Garage-Delivery/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21222091011" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt;, giving drivers the ability to securely drop packages off in your garage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aHM1AQ"&gt;A two-pack of Anker’s 20W Nano chargers is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0872ZPZT4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $21&lt;/a&gt; ($10 off), a great price if you’re looking for a capable USB-C charger for fast charging your devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="SUdJ7G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10297960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MSFZjh"&gt;Nintendo’s excellent Pro controller for the Switch is just $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPro-Controller%2F55485228&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearlycybermonday2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;Walmart&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeearlycybermonday2021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-pro-wireless-controller-black%2F141756.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. That is the cheapest price ever on a new Pro controller, which is the ideal controller if you enjoy playing Switch games on your TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s3iaNf"&gt;Philips Hue’s three-pack of white and color A19 bulbs &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6owDVczMB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost just $80&lt;/a&gt; (down from $135), making it even more affordable to add a unique vibe to your space. These bulbs have Bluetooth support, so you don’t need the Hue Bridge to get started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rbEmMj"&gt;The best deals available on 4K TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="m2b4l5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="lwMndD"&gt;Amazon still has a sizeable discount on all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="n6jZRx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame is still available for a discount at Amazon. This is a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="6llPvQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt;, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s webOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gKS15"&gt;
&lt;s&gt;If you want a capable 4K TV without spending a lot, check out this Amazon Lightning Deal on Vizio’s 58-inch MQ7 QLED TV. It’s $649 at other retailers, but &lt;/s&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3lmeyKZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;Amazon has it for $480&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;s&gt; for a limited time. It has HDMI 2.1 ports and VRR support, which are features typically reserved for pricier models.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

While we still recommend the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods sport shorter stems, IPX4 water resistance, and improved sound over the last-gen model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

This is the best deal that we’ve seen yet.

While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds like some other models, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook. While free is generally a good thing, just note that the model on offer here isn’t exactly premium, as it comes with just 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Long-Lasting/dp/B08BX7N9SK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon also has the Note 20 Ultra for $1,099&lt;/a&gt; though without any freebies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The exact amount depends on which iPhone you choose (see below), and you can also get an additional $250 Walmart e-gift card by trading in an eligible phone. The deal runs through December 3rd, but you need to activate the new phone no later than December 3rd at 11:59PM local time to take advantage of the deal. If you prefer to get this deal and trade-in squared away in person, you need to schedule an in-person appointment. This in-store deal also ends on December 3rd.&lt;/li&gt;

The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sBCByX"&gt;One day in 2011, Jack Dorsey called an all-hands meeting at Twitter. The company was in the middle of a push to redesign Twitter’s mobile apps, and the effort had led to anger and burnout. Dorsey, who had co-founded the company in 2006 with Ev Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass, was then serving as its executive chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X446i7"&gt;The company prepared for what it assumed would be a pep talk from the most eccentric of Twitter’s co-founders. And they got one, of a sort. As the meeting began, the lights at Twitter headquarters dimmed. An acoustic guitar began playing over speakers. Dorsey encouraged everyone to listen to the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DkTxxC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackbird singing in the dead of night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMYlLq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take these broken wings and learn to fly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evYQqQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All your life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEOHi0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You were only waiting for this moment to arise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="c67vHo"&gt;Sitting in the dark, no one was entirely sure what meaning Dorsey found in the Beatles’ “Blackbird.” A decade later, people I spoke with about the incident still weren’t entirely sure. From his earliest days at the company, Dorsey was an enigma: on one hand, a visionary leader with an uncanny grasp of what the future holds; on the other, a distant and often inscrutable manager whose slowness in making decisions would hobble the company for almost half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVfl94"&gt;The song concluded. Afterward, people debated what it meant, to no real end. The company finished the sprint. Jack Dorsey returned to the company as CEO a few years later. This Monday, he &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-is-expected-to-step-down-sources-say.html"&gt;announced that he was quitting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zlT5hG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal replaces Jack Dorsey as CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9heqy6"&gt;Almost nobody thought this moment would arrive today — a day that Twitter had told employees to take as “a day of rest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="H1e9Q7"&gt;Elliott wins in the end?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HnQzcM"&gt;The two questions you want to ask when a CEO steps down are: why now? And what next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofnQgv"&gt;Let’s start with the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yonj6D"&gt;On one hand, this is a genuine surprise. By many metrics, this has been a banner year for Twitter. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/technology/twitter-third-quarter-2021-earnings.html"&gt;Revenue is up&lt;/a&gt;, and so is the user base. It shipped more individual products than perhaps at any other time in its history. (Most notably, it &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/twitter-launches-spaces-live-audio-rooms-to-all-users.html"&gt;cloned Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; at impressive speed, leaving that once-buzzy social audio platform &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-clubhouse-poster-child-pandemic-hype-2021-11"&gt;moribund&lt;/a&gt;.) After spending half a decade stuck in the mud, there was a sense that Twitter finally had real momentum. From that perspective, Dorsey’s position at the company looked secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLmU6f"&gt;But Twitter is publicly traded, and its slow growth (particularly in comparison to the behemoth Facebook) has long rankled investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mLHMeO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I wrote Jack Dorsey was in for the fight of his life. It turns out he was.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NtQgyV"&gt; Last spring, the activist investor Elliott Management Corp. took a 4 percent stake in the company and announced its intention to replace Dorsey as CEO. While little known to the public, Elliott — a hedge fund controlled by the billionaire Paul Singer — is among &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/paul-singer-doomsday-investor"&gt;the most feared investors in the world&lt;/a&gt;. When the news hit, I wrote here &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/4/21163146/jack-dorsey-activist-investor-paul-singer-elliott-management"&gt;that Jack Dorsey was in for the fight of his life&lt;/a&gt;. As it turned out, he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kw21m"&gt;The odd part is that it seemed like Dorsey had won. Days after Elliott made its move, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/10/21171477/jack-dorsey-elliott-silver-lake-deal-ceo-twitter-take-private"&gt;Twitter surrendered&lt;/a&gt;, agreeing to add three new board members and form a committee to review its governance and evaluate a succession plan. Elliott partner Jesse Cohn joined Twitter’s board, but &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-appoints-new-board-member-replace-elliotts-cohn-2021-06-09/"&gt;stepped down in June&lt;/a&gt; in what I took to be a sign that the firm was satisfied by Twitter’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUloi5"&gt;The catch was that Elliott had set several aggressive growth targets for Dorsey. Under the agreement, Twitter had to grow its user base by at least 20 percent in 2020, accelerate revenue growth, and gain market share as a digital advertiser. While it has made some progress, it is not close to hitting its updated goals. (The company &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/twitter-2023-projection-315-million-daily-users-doubling-revenue-1234915120/"&gt;wants to add 100 million more daily active users in the next year&lt;/a&gt;, for example, increasing its user base by a third — a tall order for a 15-year-old company that is a household name and has already churned through much of the world’s population.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCQBj5"&gt;The stock price has been sliding throughout the fall, and today sits just a few dollars higher than it did at the time of the company’s initial public offering. Meanwhile, Elliott’s partner in the original plan to oust Dorsey, the private equity firm Silver Lake, maintains a seat on Twitter’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6GPUf"&gt;There were no outward signs of the board’s unhappiness. But looking at these facts, it’s easy to imagine two scenarios: one in which Dorsey saw a revived fight coming his way and deciding to leave before it happened; another in which the board told him his time was up and to bow out gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utFKi6"&gt;I don’t know which of those two scenarios is more likely; I do believe, however, that it was most probably one of them that led to today’s news. (The fact that the news leaked early, perhaps from the board itself, suggests to me that maybe someone worried Dorsey might have changed his mind before going through with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euZf28"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720"&gt;This was my decision and I own it&lt;/a&gt;,” Dorsey said in an email to employees. “I’m really sad … yet really happy. There aren’t many companies that get to this level. And there aren’t many founders who choose their company over their own ego. I know we’ll prove this was the right move.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6VCI4g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;not sure anyone has heard but,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I resigned from Twitter &lt;a href="https://t.co/G5tUkSSxkl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/G5tUkSSxkl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jack⚡️ (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejhf5c"&gt;Elliott, for its part, blessed the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZz1Ph"&gt;“Having gotten to know both incoming Chairman Bret Taylor and incoming CEO Parag Agrawal, we are confident that they are the right leaders for Twitter at this pivotal moment for the company,” Cohn and senior portfolio manager Marc Steinberg said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xxGgE6"&gt;The “duh” explanation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DGIzgZ"&gt;Another explanation for Jack Dorsey leaving Twitter, which may or may not be related to Elliott Management Corp., is the relative lack of evidence that Jack Dorsey wanted to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; CEO of Twitter. It is at least possible he woke up one recent morning and decided he wanted to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNk9wn"&gt;Here’s a story about not really wanting to be CEO: I’m told Dorsey was ambivalent about the company’s decision to build Fleets, its ephemeral product that mimicked Snapchat Stories. But he let the team launch it anyway at the end of last year. A while later, during an all-hands meeting, someone asked what he thought of the product. He basically shrugged, one person told me. “It’s not my thing” — that was the gist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEQ9kt"&gt;Dorsey’s section of the Q&amp;amp;A was immediately followed by the Fleets team presenting their progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEbH4j"&gt;When Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;decided to kill Fleets this year&lt;/a&gt;, Dorsey — who may not have ever posted a public Fleet — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415371196443529217?s=20"&gt;dispatched it with a tweeted waving-hand emoji&lt;/a&gt; that some internally took to indicate “good riddance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59eeQb"&gt;There are a lot of Dorsey stories like this. In the areas where he was most focused, product teams could expect lots of time, attention, and valuable feedback. In areas where he was not focused, teams could expect little to no feedback at all. He set the vision and let his deputies handle the rest. This had pros and cons, but it drove a lot of people crazy — particularly when teams were divided on the path forward, and he refused to break the tie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95OZeL"&gt;There are benefits to having a CEO who cares about only a few things, and pushes on them relentlessly. At Square, for example, Dorsey pushed executives to focus on Cash App for peer-to-peer payments and cryptocurrencies for the future of finance. Square has thrived as a result, and its market capitalization is now nearly triple that of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPPk9d"&gt;But Twitter under Dorsey has suffered from a comparable lack of focus. Its top priorities at any given time have rotated between user growth, revenue growth, conversational “health,” “serving the public conversation,” and other abstractions. People who worked with him directly, when I would ask recently how engaged Dorsey was with the core product, would tell me that they didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF9PTE"&gt;There’s a joke about Dorsey that says everyone at Twitter thought he was working more on Square, and everyone at Square thought he was working more on Twitter. This served to elide the question of how much he was working at all. One reason Elliott appears to have launched its attack was Dorsey’s declaration that (pre-pandemic) he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/6/21166384/twitter-elliott-jack-dorsey-africa-activist-investor"&gt;intended to spend most of 2020 in Africa&lt;/a&gt;, to no apparent work purpose or shareholder benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEHrMp"&gt;Dorsey knew he was perceived as distant and indecisive; he told employees that he was too slow to make decisions. But people believed him when he said — as he did Saturday, in a line that may have presaged today’s events — “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1464865985471471616"&gt;I love Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.” He was undeniably charismatic, the kind of guy who could get his employees to drink the &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-jack-dorsey-drinks-salt-juice-every-morning-2019-5"&gt;salt juice&lt;/a&gt;. A complicated figure, but one who leaves a void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8cEA4u"&gt;The new guy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HMtLoO"&gt;Into that void &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808756/twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-jack-dorsey-bluesky-moderation"&gt;steps Parag Agrawal&lt;/a&gt;, a 10-year Twitter veteran who rose through the ranks as an engineer to become its chief technical officer. Multiple people told me that “CTO” doesn’t fully capture the breadth of Agrawal’s contributions. Internally, he is perceived by many employees as a sharp technical leader; an uncommonly long-term thinker; and intensely focused on the operational side of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpUhDL"&gt;One person told me that Agrawal was among the few people internally who could regularly get Dorsey to change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xShv8"&gt;Given his long tenure as an engineer, Agrawal is highly respected by the technical side of Twitter, and has personal relationships with many of its most senior individual contributors. That could help the company retain its engineering core during the kind of organizational shift that often results in an exodus from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YChhOg"&gt;Agrawal has his detractors, too. A core complaint is that he was too close to Dorsey — and, if you’re among the Twitter employees who think Dorsey had become a liability for the company, Agrawal’s appointment may not appear to be the clean break you were hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUBBS9"&gt;In any case, Agrawal is likely to surface another cultural tension inside the company. He is among the executives who has been most focused on cryptocurrencies, and encouraged Dorsey to allow Twitter to explore decentralization and other related technologies. The company has so far announced Bluesky, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627435/twitter-bluesky-lead-jay-graber-decentralized-social-web"&gt;which could turn Twitter into a decentralized protocol&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689806/twitter-bitcoin-lightning-tipping-nft-authentication"&gt;Bitcoin-based tips&lt;/a&gt;; and (maybe eventually) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thesmarmybum/status/1443259893411049475?lang=en"&gt;NFT profile pictures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S4gOpx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it makes sense Dorsey would want to hand the reins to a fellow believer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gSfuEv"&gt;Given Dorsey’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/jack-dorseys-twitter-departure-means-more-time-for-bitcoin-passion.html"&gt;religious devotion to Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, it makes sense that he would want to hand the reins to a fellow believer. But given how polarizing crypto culture is generally, it bears watching how many Twitter employees will come along for the ride — and what may fall by the wayside as a result. Of course, that depends in part on how hard Agrawal leans in. But the early indications are that it’s a high priority for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF2b8Z"&gt;He’ll also have to work on Elliott’s wish list, of course: more users, more revenue, a bigger share of the ad market. And he’ll have to navigate other, unrelated transitions at the company. Its head of communications, Kelly Sims, left Twitter last week after less than four months at the company, in what is a highly difficult role to fill. And Sara Beykpour, who joined the company in 2012 and has lately been leading its Twitter Blue subscription product, announced recently that she is leaving the company as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="456APc"&gt;Notably, she’s married to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"&gt;Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter’s head of product&lt;/a&gt;, who was likely on the short list for CEO. I’ll be curious to see how much longer he stays at the company, given that he is already one of the company’s longest-serving product chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8NYQ8"&gt;In the meantime, Twitter now has something it hasn’t had since 2015: a full-time CEO. Time will tell how Agrawal fares in the role. But by that measure alone, he is already an improvement on his predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPRRJh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is based on conversations (some very long, others quite short) with 13 current and former Twitter employees, who requested anonymity so as to preserve their professional relationships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig, the streamer who broke the all-time Twitch subs record this year, is moving to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzNFp2Yczx7EwQ9wT-oZj_12Q1k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207451/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_4.51.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ludwig posted a video announcing the move Monday.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ludwig (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIliHG_yo7w" target="_blank"&gt;via YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BfnDDg"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren, a streamer perhaps best known for his month-long subathon that took place earlier this year, is moving from Twitch to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1465442046328524805"&gt;stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. Ahgren’s first stream on YouTube will take place tomorrow, November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dugxj"&gt;Ludwig leaves behind a significant presence on Twitch. He has &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig"&gt;3.1 million followers&lt;/a&gt;, and TwitchTracker’s metrics indicate he has more than &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/ludwig/subscribers"&gt;27,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing. And by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22362532/ludwig-twitch-subathon-ends-stream-ninja-subs-record"&gt;end of his subathon&lt;/a&gt;, he had broken the all-time Twitch subs record — TwitchTracker says &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers/all-time"&gt;he peaked at 283,066 subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. But he won’t be starting from nothing on YouTube, where he already has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPseYLGpNygVi34QpGNqpA"&gt;2.08 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lEvye4"&gt;Ahgren is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube as of late, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;Ben “DrLupo” Lupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652368/timthetatman-streaming-twitch-switch-youtube-gaming"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatMan” Betar’s&lt;/a&gt; jumps in August and September, respectively. YouTube also brought over Jack “CouRage” Dunlop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; (who announced on November 23rd that he would &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CouRageJD/status/1463190958909054987"&gt;remain on the platform&lt;/a&gt;), and Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay purchases sneaker authentication service Sneaker Con</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dW8O0cZTDjtbLapzeR3fCb8ePTI=/126x0:1490x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207249/Ebay_Sneakers.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: eBay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mqAsr5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-acquires-sneaker-con-authentication-business/"&gt;eBay has bought out&lt;/a&gt; sneaker authentication service Sneaker Con, a company that gives sneaker-lovers the peace of mind that the kicks they’re purchasing are real. The acquisition builds upon eBay’s existing relationship with the service, which began back in October 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514028/ebay-sneaker-con-authentication-100-guarantee-fake-counterfeit-limited-edition"&gt;when eBay first launched its sneaker vetting process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrsbCl"&gt;When select sneaker brands are purchased for over $100 on eBay, the shoes go through Sneaker Con before reaching the buyer. There, the sneakers are thoroughly vetted by experts who ensure that the sneakers are authentic and match the description of the original listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tJthIf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;1.55 million sneakers have been authenticated on eBay&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMpgon"&gt;The sneakers are then sent to the buyers with tags showing that they’ve been verified. eBay notes that since the start of the initiative, 1.55 million sneakers have been authenticated on eBay. Its stake in the sneaker market also remains steady, as 1.9 million sneakers are available on the platform daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQtaSo"&gt;“The response to our authentication offering has been overwhelming, and this acquisition allows us to continue to transform eBay and bring a higher level of trust and confidence to every transaction,” said Jordan Sweetnam, the SVP and general manager of eBay North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGEmGX"&gt;eBay offers its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fauthenticity-guarantee%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F29%2F22808373%2Febay-sneaker-con-acquisition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Authenticity Guarantee&lt;/a&gt; with not only sneakers but also luxury &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebay-launches-authentication-on-all-watches-sold-for-2-000-or-more-in-the-us-with-new-service-authenticity-guarantee-301125281.html"&gt;watches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Announcements/eBay-Launches-Authentication-Service-for-Luxury-Handbags/ba-p/27601197"&gt;handbags&lt;/a&gt; purchased on the platform. It also uses an unnamed third party to authenticate both types of items, which raises the question of whether eBay will buy out these services as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>xCloud’s new Clarity Boost promises clearer streams, but it’s only on Edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3eX3A24E-olvxUiiej92S_NyjM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207213/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3Uuzu"&gt;Microsoft’s new Clarity Boost feature for Xbox Cloud Gaming (aka xCloud) is intended to make your cloud gaming streams a little bit less fuzzy, but it will only be available on the company’s Edge browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hW7QAZ"&gt;Clarity Boost “uses a set of client-side scaling improvements to improve the visual quality of the video stream,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/29/clarity-boost-with-xbox-cloud-gaming-on-edge-browser/"&gt;Microsoft’s Milena Gonzalez said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I tried Clarity Boost in a few games, and I felt that it made a noticeable difference. Games were generally less blurry, and many smaller details like leaves and bricks looked much sharper than they do with Clarity Boost off. It doesn’t &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; change the way games look, in my opinion, but if you want xCloud games to be a little more clear, I’d recommend flipping Clarity Boost on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ4QB2"&gt;Here are a few comparisons I put together to show you the differences. The first two are from &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eeEIQk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="v4IDxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893192"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GxJ7J"&gt;And here are two from &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9QQ6sH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Hfceu6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5YQyU"&gt;My colleague Tom Warren also showed off the new feature &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-bB2GSBvKM"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bwvh63"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-bB2GSBvKM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LRK5U4"&gt;If you want to see the differences for yourself on your machine, you can try Clarity Boost now by installing &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/canary"&gt;Microsoft Edge Canary&lt;/a&gt;. But if you don’t want to use a bleeding edge (pun intended) version of the browser just to try Clarity Boost, it will be available to all Edge users “by next year,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xbQUk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 29th, 6:42PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added video from Tom Warren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An introduction to Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s new CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yl0oGjIt0TgVu6CxmhCUr2owxmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207096/acastro_211129_4896_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MDoKtA"&gt;Twitter has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;a new CEO&lt;/a&gt;: Parag Agrawal, who’ll be taking over for Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, the longest-serving chief executive in the company’s 15-plus-year history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Co67O"&gt;Agrawal isn’t the most well-known of names either inside or outside of Twitter. He’s been with the company for over a decade, though, working his way up from an engineer to become its top executive (and a close friend of Dorsey’s). Agrawal first started at Twitter back in October 2011 with a focus on ad products, and he became the first recipient of the company’s “Distinguished Engineer” title. He was later appointed chief technology officer in October 2017, during which time he’s jumped in to address high-profile problems (like a large-scale password security issue) and take on some of the company’s bolder initiatives (like decentralization). But despite that long tenure, Agrawal, who is 37, hasn’t spent much time in the public eye — something that will immediately change with his new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTRETT"&gt;That said, there are a few cues from Agrawal’s history as CTO that could indicate where Twitter might go next under his leadership. Agrawal is the fourth person to take the reins at Twitter, after Dorsey (who led the company from 2006 to 2008, and again from 2015 until now), Evan Williams (who co-founded Twitter alongside Dorsey and served as CEO from 2008 to 2010), and Dick Costolo (Twitter’s former COO, who served as CEO from 2010 through 2015). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2vicPX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Argrawal hasn’t spent much time in the public eye — until now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WnfjXe"&gt;In his time as CTO, one of Agrawal’s biggest projects has been his overseeing of the company’s decentralized Bluesky platform, which was first announced in December 2019. Intended as an “open and decentralized standard for social media” that Twitter itself could eventually transition to using, Bluesky has been one of the more dramatic ideas for Twitter’s future and a pet project of Dorsey’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kulklv"&gt;Bluesky has also been picking up steam in the past few months after a long period of radio silence: the group published its review of existing decentralized social media systems at the beginning of the year and finally put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627435/twitter-bluesky-lead-jay-graber-decentralized-social-web"&gt;cryptocurrency developer Jay Graber&lt;/a&gt; in charge of Bluesky in August after months of searching for a product lead. Presumably, Bluesky’s development — and its potential impact in replacing the underpinnings of Twitter’s platform — is something that will continue to be a major project for Agrawal as CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7HRkf"&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774501/twitter-crypto-dedicated-team-dorsey-square-decentralization"&gt;newly founded Twitter Crypto team&lt;/a&gt; led by Tess Rinearson that was announced earlier in November also reported directly to Agrawal (although it’s not clear if that will continue to be the case following his promotion). That team is also set to work closely with Bluesky, which — combined with Agrawal’s interest in decentralized Web3 platforms — speaks to a possible direction for Twitter’s future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="08JWtt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter is funding research into a decentralized version of its platform","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"},{"title":"Twitter’s decentralized social network project finally has a leader","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627435/twitter-bluesky-lead-jay-graber-decentralized-social-web"},{"title":"Twitter is launching a dedicated crypto team, part of its push toward decentralization","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774501/twitter-crypto-dedicated-team-dorsey-square-decentralization"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gaERWY"&gt;That experience with Bluesky could gel nicely with another of Agrawal’s biggest projects as Twitter’s chief technology officer: the years-long effort to try and move some of Twitter’s products off its own servers to more robust cloud services from companies like Amazon and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIX1id"&gt;Agrawal spearheaded the effort to advance Twitter’s internal technology back in 2018 in an effort to try and help speed up the pace of feature development and deployment, as noted in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/twitter-cto-we-need-to-do-better"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “When we hear people say that Twitter is slow at shipping, that hurts, and that is something we use as motivation,” Agrawal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvKtbk"&gt;That’s led to changes like &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2018/a-new-collaboration-with-google-cloud"&gt;Twitter’s partnership with Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; for processing data in May 2018 and the ongoing effort to slowly switch over the Twitter timeline feature itself to Amazon Web Services (which is expected to be complete in 2023). “I do think people are starting to recognize now externally that we are going faster. And it feels good because it’s like a bunch of work from the past starting to pay off,” Agrawal noted in the interview. “But we’re nowhere close to done. I think we have a lot of opportunity to go even faster and [in] even more noticeable ways in the coming years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Y4d3"&gt;Other Agrawal projects were more reactionary fixes to existing Twitter problems, albeit significant ones: in his time as CTO, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2020/transparency-image-cropping.html"&gt;Agrawal was a part of the effort&lt;/a&gt; last year to address &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;Twitter’s problematic racial cropping issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;with photo previews&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html"&gt;handling the public explanation&lt;/a&gt; for the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17316684/twitter-password-bug-security-flaw-exposed-change-now"&gt;2018 password bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlAGKu"&gt;Agrawal has also hinted at how he’ll address one of Twitter’s biggest challenges: moderation. In a 2020 interview with &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/18/1012066/emtech-stage-twitters-cto-on-misinformation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Agrawal said that Twitter’s role is to build a healthy place for conversing online, suggesting that could come at the expense of allowing people to say whatever they want. “Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAHubZ"&gt;That doesn’t mean moderating all misinformation, though. Agrawal views Twitter’s goal as avoiding the “specific harm that misleading information can cause” rather than “trying to be an arbiter of what is true or false on the internet.” That’s because, as Agrawal puts it, “defining misinformation is really, really hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5wHM6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Decentralization, moderation, and more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WM6YZG"&gt;That stance may continue to lead to issues with Republican politicians, many of whom are already opposed to Twitter’s moderation policies and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;ban of former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1465365574297559045?s=20"&gt;House Judiciary GOP Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; already referred to Twitter’s new CEO as “much worse” than Dorsey after latching onto an out-of-context tweet from Agrawal from 2010 (before he was employed at Twitter) quoting a comedic segment from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;’s Aasif Mandvi &lt;a href="https://www.cc.com/video/vz5edd/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-npr-staffing-decision-2010"&gt;about stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research"&gt;Repeated reports&lt;/a&gt; have shown that social media platforms like Twitter have no empirical proof of bias against conservative content, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740703/twitter-algorithm-right-wing-amplification-study"&gt;recent study from Twitter itself&lt;/a&gt; found that the platform’s algorithms actually favored right-wing views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMH2G7"&gt;It’s one of many hurdles Agrawal will have to overcome. While he inherits a company that has been growing its daily user figures and rolling out products at a speedier-than-ever clip, Twitter still faces ongoing issues with user growth at home, ad products stymied by recent privacy changes, and faster-growing social networks like Snapchat. Agrawal may not be the most publicly recognizable candidate for running Twitter, but his years of experience with the company, deep experience with Twitter’s product, and past work in helping modernize Twitter’s tech stack makes him an interesting choice for CEO, especially as decentralized blockchain technology becomes more prominent. &lt;/p&gt;
