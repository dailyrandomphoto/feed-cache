    <title>Google might’ve accidentally approved an ad for a Target gift card scam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Brs29KvSur0yTml2BcI3Zdjax0g=/0x0:4245x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70395232/1288098838.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CKqHbu"&gt;Most of us check our gift card balances online (because who actually keeps those receipts that tell us how much money we have left on them?), making an apparent oversight by Google all the worse. It appears that Google inadvertently approved a prominent ad for a phony Target gift card balance checker that’s meant to steal your funds, although it has since removed the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg9E3y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/"&gt;A Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;r/assholedesign&lt;/a&gt; discovered the slip-up when searching Google for “Target gift card balance” on mobile and found that the very first result is an ad, titled “Check Gift Card Balance - Target.” Only, the site isn’t Target — it’s actually a site called “bristolhirevan.” The ad’s description says it will let you check your gift card balance “immediately” and that it also offers “all van sizes to fit your needs” — how can you get more legit than that? My colleague Sean Hollister and I found the same phony ad when searching for the exact phrase ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V1vAjQ"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2022-01-15T22:45:40.362882+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/s4m8ou/i_googled_target_gift_card_balance_to_check_gift/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;I googled target gift card balance to check gift card balances. An ad appears above the actual target website that copies the target website. I'm imagining it steals card numbers from people that don't check. I reported the ad to Google a few days ago and nothing has happened to it.&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/"&gt;assholedesign&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNNXPF"&gt;Okay, while the name of the site doesn’t sound convincing at all, its interface sure looks like the real thing, although the actual Target site requires you to sign in to check your gift card balance, while this fake site doesn’t. Besides that, the only things that are off about the webpage are the URL, which still has the “bristolhirevan” domain and the fact that every single link on the page leads to the real Target homepage, despite promising to link to a weekly ad or a gift registry. If you were really in a rush (and were somehow distracted enough to ignore the mention of vans), you just might accidentally enter your gift card’s number and security code here, resulting in it getting stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OimIvf"&gt;“This behavior directly violates our policies against phishing, and we immediately suspended the account and removed the ads,” Google spokesperson Christa Muldoon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are continuously adjusting our enforcement mechanisms to prevent this type of abuse.” Muldoon also noted that Google typically suspends or bans the bad actor’s account, and in this case, the Target scammer was suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d78ics"&gt;Fortunately, the ad has been taken down, which I’ve confirmed after doing another search for “Target gift card balance” — the real Target balance checker has taken the ad’s place. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Target spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo also noted that the company “reported the activity to Google” and is “working to get the fraudulent website taken down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbNs8c"&gt;Gift card scams appear to be on the rise. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-data-show-major-increase-gift-cards-scam-payment-method"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that victims of gift card scams lost a total of $148 million&lt;/a&gt; within the first nine months of 2021 — more than all of 2020. Target gift cards are apparently scammers’ cards of choice, as FTC data shows people were scammed out of $35 million worth of Target gift cards last year, more than double the amount of any other gift card brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61J1Xr"&gt;As pointed out by the FTC, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/gift-card-scams"&gt;gift card scams&lt;/a&gt; often take place over the phone, with the scammer pretending to be an employee of a company like Google or Amazon (or even someone from a federal agency) who demands the victim make a payment in the form of a gift card. However, fake balance checker sites like these often hide in plain sight — apparently even as ads on Google. A 2020 report from &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scammers-spoof-targets-gift-card-balance-checking-page/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; draws attention to sites that impersonate Target gift card balance checker pages, noting that Target is actually one of the most popular sites for scammers to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzFJ2h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th 11:33AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add statements from Google and Target spokespersons and noted that the ad has since been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M5Fu9M"&gt;Well, hi, everyone! You’ve got Aria. Real excited to be here with y’all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu3TDF"&gt;As a reminder, Ashley’s out this week, so if you have things to share, you can send ‘em my way (aria.bracci@voxmedia.com). In the meantime, I’ll share some things with you, which is my job, to share those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7pUq4"&gt;P.S. Julie, if you’re reading this, tell &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jatomic/status/1481022484874997761"&gt;your 10-year-old&lt;/a&gt; we said hey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="WVxIPI"&gt;
&lt;p id="dCcyjp"&gt;Hot Pod Summit is almost here! We’re hosting the invite-only event on February 24th in Brooklyn, New York, as part of On Air Fest. You can see this year’s On Air Fest lineup and &lt;a href="http://onairfest.com/"&gt;buy tickets here&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have more to share on programming and ticketing for Hot Pod Summit in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TMKEgv"&gt;
&lt;p id="LzIjHx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: $100K podcast fund launches for upstart shows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrLbBE"&gt;Starting today, budding US-based podcasters can apply to receive money from &lt;a href="http://www.podcash.com/"&gt;a new podcast sponsorship fund&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used for any purpose, from paying contributors to buying recording equipment. The fund, called &lt;a href="http://www.podcash.com/"&gt;Podca$h&lt;/a&gt;, will deliver one-time payments between $250 and $5,000 to up to 100 recipients. Eligible applicants include people who’ve never podcasted before, as well as those who’ve received less than $10,000 in total funding or sponsorships for an existing project. Applications are open until March 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ODv0cF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EAl7bZ"&gt;Podca$h was conceived to help more creators make well-known, well-paying podcasts. The two companies funding and operating the program, the short-form audio platform &lt;a href="https://racket.com/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt; and money-management software &lt;a href="https://www.usestir.com/"&gt;Stir&lt;/a&gt;, share a mission of supporting homegrown projects and helping them take off. “In podcasting, the rich tend to get richer,” says Racket founder and CEO Austin Petersmith. “We wanted to limit this campaign to people who have yet to make significant revenue for their podcasts. We also didn’t want to exclude those who have been at this for a while and are making, say, a few hundred dollars a month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kia3pR"&gt;Recipients will be chosen by a panel of judges with fingers on the pulse of digital media — angel investor and &lt;a href="https://thisweekinstartups.com/"&gt;podcast host&lt;/a&gt; Jason Calacanis, the YouTube-using artist &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/humblethepoet/?hl=en"&gt;Humble the Poet&lt;/a&gt;, and several executives overseeing audience growth and talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJz5cg"&gt;Podca$h is a sponsorship program, not a scholarship. Recipients will be asked to deliver an ad read for Racket and Stir on the shows they ultimately develop, “but whether they do it or not will be on the honor system,” says Petersmith. Full terms can be found on &lt;a href="http://www.podcash.com/"&gt;the official Podca$h website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKKE40"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An industry so big it needs librarians to organize it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSTYva"&gt;Podchaser, the &lt;a href="http://podchaser.com/"&gt;podcast discovery service&lt;/a&gt;, recently hired Norman Chella as a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NormanChella/status/1477802853515202562"&gt;full-time “podcast librarian&lt;/a&gt;.” Chella is only the second person I’ve ever heard of to have that job title — and shortly after his role was announced, Ma’ayan Plaut, who’s considered to be &lt;a href="https://radiopublic.com/weird-work-859DbP/s1!1a925"&gt;the first podcast librarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maayanplaut/status/1478015150829576196"&gt;welcomed him to the club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kJxGU"&gt;A librarian for podcasts does a lot of the things that a librarian for books would do — add new titles to a collection, organize them so people can find what they’re looking for — which, as the audio landscape gets more crowded, offers a systematic way to find shows. This helps overwhelmed listeners, and it also helps podcasters, for whom making money requires a show to be discoverable, both by audiences and potential advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s53L4"&gt;As Plaut told me over email, there have been people in the audio industry with “the heart and spirit of a Podcast Librarian” since podcasts emerged. But Plaut and Chella may very well be the only ones who’ve ever been given designated, full-time librarian titles for audio companies. And while there’s a fair amount of similarities between Plaut’s 2016–2019 tenure at RadioPublic and Chella’s new role at Podchaser, the ways that the role has changed in just a few years show how much the podcast industry has changed, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="fzDay4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m here to provoke every single person in the podcast industry to record their body of work accurately.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zaM3WN"&gt;The biggest shift is the increased emphasis on ad sales. While Plaut spent a lot of her time finding, listening to, and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/radio-public/happy-international-podcast-day-from-the-radiopublic-reference-desk-2dad8e5904b9"&gt;recommending shows&lt;/a&gt; for curious listeners, Chella knows that companies are increasingly curious, too, and he tells me he’ll be working to ensure that both the stats that are pulled in from streaming platforms (e.g., estimated monthly listens) and the specs that users add themselves (e.g., host bios) are correct. As Chella says, “a misstep in crediting can prevent that one sponsor from reaching out to your podcast for a great deal. You never know!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HALnDx"&gt;Another change is the addition of a “curator” role to Chella’s plate, since there’s plenty of room for error in both the automatic and manual ways of contributing data that I mentioned above. Podchaser’s library may have predated Chella, but it takes a human to monitor such a system, coach people on how to contribute to it, and identify ways it could be better. As Chella says, “I’m here to provoke every single person in the podcast industry to record their body of work accurately.” This includes things like getting folks to credit shows’ contributors using uniform language, an area where Podchaser is &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gaTSzMkBnxpZOoMcvPBN_FczgxIvm-ik/view"&gt;trying to establish standard terms&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes getting podcasters excited about being documented at all — in Chella’s words, “getting their name etched in podcast history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkOKi4"&gt;No one took over Plaut’s librarian position when she left RadioPublic three years ago. But times are a’changing, and there’s a lot to do, so it seems likely that we’ll see more of these jobs pop up soon. As Chella puts it, surprisingly calmly, “the mission to document the timeline of every podcast in the world requires someone’s full attention on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmgLrb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube temporarily bars Dan Bongino for COVID misinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gz7Tcp"&gt;Conservative talk show host Dan Bongino has had his YouTube account and monetization privileges temporarily suspended after receiving his first “strike” for violating the company’s COVID misinformation policy, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/589853-youtube-temporarily-suspends-demonetizes-dan-bonginos-channel"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bongino is a big name in radio — he’s Cumulus Media’s Rush Limbaugh replacement — so YouTube is showing here that moderation rules apply even to a major host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99CgKz"&gt;This stands in contrast to Spotify’s resistance to moderating or removing content from the comparably controversial Joe Rogan. Rogan has also been sharing dangerous information around COVID, enough that &lt;a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/"&gt;hundreds of medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; recently petitioned Spotify to enforce a misinformation policy. But Spotify has not responded to calls to take his episodes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="mBqfiO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IFrvOc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC funding nearly slashed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vx6Wct"&gt;It’s a storyline that will &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/02/donald-trump-public-media-pbs-npr-1202856498/"&gt;sound familiar to US residents&lt;/a&gt;: over the weekend, the publicly funded BBC was threatened with the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/16/bbc-licence-fee-to-be-abolished-in-2027-and-funding-frozen"&gt;elimination of most of its financial support&lt;/a&gt;. This was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/17/business/bbc-license-fee.html"&gt;ultimately walked back&lt;/a&gt; and replaced with a less catastrophic change, but it’s one that still deals a blow to the broadcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3gyGD"&gt;On Sunday, the UK culture secretary threatened to end the license fee that residents pay to the BBC, which makes up three-fourths of its funding, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/17/business/bbc-license-fee.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fee was expected to remain frozen for the next two years, rather than rising proportionately with inflation, then be phased out entirely by 2027. By Monday, the only remaining change was the freeze. Though the longer-term fate of funding is unclear, even the fee freeze will affect BBC’s ability to create programming, necessitating what &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/16/bbc-licence-fee-to-be-abolished-in-2027-and-funding-frozen"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; estimates&lt;/a&gt; will be “hundreds of millions of pounds” in budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXVNaU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recordings for Spaces for all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTecYp"&gt;Twitter is now letting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22882479/twitter-spaces-recordings-ios-android"&gt;all Spaces hosts record their sessions&lt;/a&gt; on mobile, then access detailed attendance numbers. Users will now be able to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1482048722167123979"&gt;differentiate between listeners&lt;/a&gt; who tuned in live versus those who watched the replay for up to 30 days after a Space ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rU9OmX"&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uy60K"&gt;Excited to see you Insiders on Thursday! And Friday! Aria lives on!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US competition enforcers launch overhaul of merger approval process</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce Committee Considers Nominees For NASA Administrator And Federal Trade Commissioner" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ednaij6h-eczMm6xLhBv0qNF7E=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404456/1232439596.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sIPrBx"&gt;On Tuesday, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission launched a joint effort to modernize antitrust enforcement, seeking comment on how the agencies can apply current law in cases against tech companies like Meta (parent company of Facebook) and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1USwe"&gt;The announcement came at a joint press conference from FTC Chair Lina Khan and Justice Department Antitrust Chief Jonathan Kanter, who described the move as a wide-ranging enforcement modernization effort. While the announcement spans markets, it specifically questions how regulators should approach merger approval in digital markets, potentially setting new legal standards around data aggregation, interoperability, and market consolidation that can affect competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lsx3kD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We absolutely need to ensure that our tools today allow us to fully understand the markets of today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JrPC5r"&gt;“The digital revolution has not only impacted the markets of tech but markets across our economy, many of which have been rebuilt from the inside out,” Kanter said during Tuesday’s press conference. “Just think about what happens when you check your weather forecast or purchase your morning coffee. In seconds, whether you see them or not, you interact with dozens of distinct services; many of these services have the ability to exploit and exercise market power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqCidi"&gt;Tuesday’s announcement follows new plans in the Senate to push through a pair of bills targeting tech giants like Apple, Meta, and Google. &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/01/14/2022/executive-business-meeting"&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee plans to vote&lt;/a&gt; on the American Innovation and Choice Online and the Open App Markets Acts on Thursday — bills that would outlaw dominant platforms from abusing their market dominance, allow third-party app stores, and protect software sideloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w686Y4"&gt;“This step toward Judiciary Committee consideration shows strong bipartisan support for our Open App Markets Act — to stop Apple and Google from crushing competitors and undercutting consumers,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said. “Breaking the ironclad grip of these two behemoths on the multi-billion dollar app market is long overdue. This measure has solid momentum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcIwaG"&gt;Both known as fierce critics of tech consolidation, Kanter and Khan were confirmed to their posts last year, marking significant wins for progressives under the Biden administration. Before joining the DOJ, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;Kanter represented companies&lt;/a&gt; like Yelp and Microsoft in antitrust suits against Google. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Khan published a legal paper&lt;/a&gt; calling for new laws to prevent anti-competitive behavior from marketplace platforms like Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZYH0C"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878808/ftc-meta-facebook-lawsuit-ruling-revised-complaint-discovery"&gt;a federal judge said the FTC could proceed&lt;/a&gt; with an antitrust suit against Meta, where the commission seeks to unwind the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9ah2k"&gt;“We absolutely need to ensure that our tools today allow us to fully understand the markets of today and the realities of how our markets function,” Kanter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5xLUnU"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884217/free-covid-19-test-biden-500-million-january-19-usps"&gt;the White House announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://COVIDTests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt;, a site that you can use to order four free at-home COVID-19 rapid antigen tests per household, and it looks like it has gone live ahead of schedule. It was initially set to start taking orders on January 19th, but it appears you can place an order for your free tests now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gtZs8y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pretty impressive — the free covid test ordering site is taking orders now, a day *ahead* of the announced launch. (I wonder if this is a test for all users or just some users?) &lt;a href="https://t.co/aFmwzZ0Eqn"&gt;https://t.co/aFmwzZ0Eqn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uZ0zmVqhXc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uZ0zmVqhXc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— anildash (@anildash) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1483478718752428032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gg7IFh"&gt;Some users have reported not seeing the “Order Free At-Home Tests” button, which connects you to the order page via the USPS website. However, you can get around this by heading directly to &lt;a href="https://special.usps.com/testkits"&gt;the ordering page&lt;/a&gt;. To place an order, simply fill out your name and address, and it will ship free starting in late January. No credit card is required, and they are supposed to ship within 7 - 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaUDSW"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;statement from the White House&lt;/a&gt; says that you’ll also be able to call a hotline to order tests if you’re unable to access the website and that the government will “work with national and local community-based organizations to support the nation’s hardest-hit and highest-risk communities in requesting tests.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says COVIDTests website will distribute free rapid tests starting January 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axfACWQk7alU8K1psz5dgmX2Bh4=/58x0:1807x1166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70391114/Screen_Shot_2022_01_14_at_11.41.43.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site is live, but you won’t be able to order tests until Wednesday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sHGd6n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 18th, 12:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://special.usps.com/testkits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ordering page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are live now, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;&lt;em&gt;one day earlier than expected&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIrLg3"&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1482072719688712204?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that people will be able to order free COVID-19 tests from &lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt; starting on Wednesday, January 19th. This follows a promise that the government would be setting up a website to distribute 500 million tests, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;President Joe Biden announced in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPUV8X"&gt;You’ll only have to put in two pieces of info to get a test shipped to you — your name and address. In its announcement, the White House said the tests will ship through the US Postal Service “within 7–12 days of ordering.” Currently, the limit is &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;four tests per residential address.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SYOBT6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To order their tests, the only two things people will need are their name and residential mailing address. Tests will typically ship through the mail within 7-12 days of ordering, and be delivered First Class through the U.S. Postal Service.&lt;/p&gt;— The White House (@WhiteHouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1482072719688712204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F4idES"&gt;On Wednesday of this week, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880467/white-house-covid-coronavirus-testing-website-order-rapid-tests"&gt;White House advisor said&lt;/a&gt; the site “should be online by this weekend.” Technically, the government has made that deadline — you can visit &lt;a href="https://covidtests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt; right now, though it’s currently showing a landing page letting you know that tests will be available Wednesday and that you won’t have to put in a credit card number to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NC6XBD"&gt;The USPS isn’t just responsible for getting the tests to people. It was also tapped to develop a website that will have to deal with potentially millions of people trying to get a test at the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/white-house-covid-test-website"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report cites a government official who said that it’s “taking our website launch very seriously” and that it “didn’t start from scratch” building the site. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5992087/us-digital-service-created-to-prevent-tech-debacles-like-healthcare-gov"&gt;US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt; will also be helping to launch the site and provide support when needed, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMYH0l"&gt;Given the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/us-world/2013/12/3/5163228/healthcare-gov-obamacare-website-shows-how-government-can-do-tech-better"&gt;less-than-stellar reputation with launching healthcare websites&lt;/a&gt;, there’s some skepticism about whether the site will be able to handle the traffic — and some have rightfully pointed out that some of the most vulnerable people could have difficulties getting online and navigating a website. A &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;statement from the White House&lt;/a&gt; says that you’ll also be able to call a hotline to order tests if you’re unable to access the website and that the government will “work with national and local community-based organizations to support the nation’s hardest-hit and highest-risk communities in requesting tests.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase will let you pay with Mastercard in its upcoming NFT marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBr7aBOtKdNYad84CxDOQ6D-N-s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70404260/akrales_190206_3175_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AfvZKS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-and-mastercard-partner-to-revolutionize-nft-purchase-experience-8e486a392c55"&gt;Coinbase is partnering with Mastercard&lt;/a&gt; to allow card payments on its upcoming NFT marketplace. This means you’ll be able to directly purchase an NFT with fiat currency (also known as a government-issued currency, such as the USD) using your Mastercard credit or debit card, all without having to buy cryptocurrency first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU5Yyd"&gt;The cryptocurrency exchange says it’s working with Mastercard to “classify NFTs as ‘digital goods,’” which should, in turn, make NFTs more accessible to someone who might be uncomfortable purchasing and storing cryptocurrency. Most NFT marketplaces require that you purchase cryptocurrency first, add it to a secure wallet, and then connect that wallet to the marketplace, a process that obviously isn’t as simple as your typical online purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mo5UAA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AOxnkT"&gt;“Expanding the audience for NFTs allows this burgeoning market to support more creators and could spark the next evolution of digital commerce,” says Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard’s executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products, in an &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2022/coinbase-nft-marketplace-making-it-easier-for-everyone-to-buy-nfts/"&gt;announcement on Mastercard’s site&lt;/a&gt;. “Getting more people involved safely and securely is perhaps the best way to help the NFT market thrive.” Dhamodharan also notes that Mastercard will use &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/september/mastercard-acquires-ciphertrace-to-enhance-crypto-capabilities/"&gt;its acquisition of CipherTrace&lt;/a&gt;, a cryptocurrency intelligence company, to help bolster the safety of NFT purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTv3CR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723131/coinbase-nfts-crypto-marketplace"&gt;Coinbase first announced its NFT marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, called Coinbase NFT, in October, describing it as a platform that will let you trade, sell, and mint NFTs. Coinbase NFT still hasn’t gone live, but it does have &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fnft%2Fannounce&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22889359%2Fcoinbase-mastercard-nft-marketplace-payments" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a waitlist&lt;/a&gt; you can sign up for to gain early access. Other popular NFT marketplaces have already explored the possibility of adding credit and debit card payments, with &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@duncancockfoster/introducing-the-nifty-gateway-marketplace-buy-and-sell-any-nifty-with-a-credit-card-instantly-60f1eb0114c2"&gt;Nifty Gateway offering such payments since day one&lt;/a&gt;. Rarible also offers the option of &lt;a href="https://rarible.medium.com/buy-nfts-with-your-credit-card-on-rarible-com-eccc43d8fe00"&gt;buying an NFT directly with a Visa or Mastercard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXeemc"&gt;On OpenSea, however, you still have to jump through the hoops of &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012903682-How-do-I-add-funds-using-MoonPay-"&gt;adding funds using a third-party service&lt;/a&gt;, called MoonPay, and then converting your fiat currency to Ethereum before making a purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/nft/how-to-buy-nfts-in-4-easy-steps-421499824684903165"&gt;Binance operates in a similar manner&lt;/a&gt;, with users required to load up a wallet with cryptocurrency before buying NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft and Activision Blizzard: the latest news on the acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Call of Duty Warzone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/878UBIsLjp78PUJbDTQJtLfLlH4=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403933/04C_IN_GAME_MODES_BR_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from Call of Duty: Warzone, Activision Blizzard’s free-to-play FPS game.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Everything you need to know about gaming’s biggest acquisition yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HyVJCh"&gt;Microsoft announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;it intends to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that will make Microsoft one of the biggest gaming companies in the world. With the deal, popular gaming franchises like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and more will be in the fold of Microsoft’s ever-expanding portfolio of studios, alongside Bethesda and its own Xbox Game Studios. Also included as part of the deal is King, the makers of &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;, signaling that Microsoft may utilize the company to compete in the mobile space. In early 2021, Take-Two Interactive (which houses developers like 2K, Private Division, and Rockstar Games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876184/take-two-interactive-zynga-acquisition-deal"&gt;purchased Zynga for $12.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSK7Pm"&gt;Though the deal hasn’t come to pass, Microsoft’s intent to acquire Activision Blizzard raises questions around antitrust and around how Microsoft might steer Activision Blizzard’s toxic company culture and make adjustments to its leadership’s role to promote an equitable work environment moving forward. In recent months, there have been several high-profile claims of sexual harassment levied against Activision Blizzard, and in July 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) sued Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for promoting a culture of “constant sexual harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEcOY5"&gt;We’ll be keeping you updated with the latest news on the big acquisition here, with reports that interrogate how the gaming world might change (in good ways and in bad ways) with one of the largest third-party game studios under Microsoft’s ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mike Windle/Getty Images for Vanity Fair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xUKrSF"&gt;Since Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;was sued in July by the state of California&lt;/a&gt; for a culture of “constant sexual harassment,” among many other troubling issues, the company has been in a state of controversy. There were a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;pair of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22786117/activision-blizzard-walk-out-bobby-kotick-resignation-demands"&gt;employee walkouts&lt;/a&gt;, and more than 1,500 employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;signed a petition to remove CEO Bobby Kotick&lt;/a&gt;. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson recently told the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-pushes-out-dozens-of-employees-over-workplace-misconduct-11642428001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that 37 people had exited the company, and 44 have been disciplined as part of its investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zRubeZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kotick will continue as CEO, for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gWOqAO"&gt;Kotick himself was the center of another &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report saying the publisher’s former CEO was not only aware of but participated in the company’s pervasive toxic culture. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329"&gt;Employees called for Kotick to step down&lt;/a&gt; not long after the report was published, as the bosses of both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; told their employees they were troubled by the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz8QtQ"&gt;Now, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is in line to run the company as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft has a deal to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; to bolster Game Pass and, supposedly, its metaverse ambitions. According to a press release, “Bobby Kotick will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and he and his team will maintain their focus on driving efforts to further strengthen the company’s culture and accelerate business growth.” After that, the business will report to Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayXe1f"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889393/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-activision-blizzard-email"&gt;see what Spencer and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told their employees here&lt;/a&gt;, and below, we’ve included &lt;a href="https://activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2022/01/defining-the-future"&gt;Kotick’s letter to workers at Activision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rlr2Rz"&gt;Team,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UadyYx"&gt;Today is an incredibly exciting day. As we continue our journey to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment, we will eventually do so as part of Microsoft. I am certain that our incredible talent and extraordinary games combined with our shared commitment to the very best workplace will enable us to grow in an increasingly more competitive race for leadership as gaming through the metaverse evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmNchj"&gt;How we got here and where we’re going&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fj6UEM"&gt;When you reflect on what we’ve built together, we have so much to be proud of. For the last 31 years, we’ve continuously shaped gaming through our commitment to deliver joy, fun, and the thrill of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTjmKH"&gt;We’ve transformed games into social experiences and enabled players to find purpose and meaning through the most engaging form of entertainment – our games. By doing so, we’ve created and entertained communities of hundreds of millions of players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cVo7w"&gt;Connecting these communities together is the next step. Facebook, Google, Tencent, NetEase, Amazon, Apple, Sony, Disney – and many more – have ambitions for their own gaming and metaverse initiatives. Established and emerging competitors see opportunity for virtual worlds filled with professionally produced content, user generated content and rich social connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVEhr2"&gt;Our talent and our games are important components of the construction of a rich metaverse. We have always attracted the very best game makers and built the very best games, seizing opportunity with passion, inspiration, focus, and determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZAo3z"&gt;A partnership to define the future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6qcKv"&gt;As investments in cloud computing, AI and machine learning, data analytics, and user interface and experience capabilities are becoming more competitive, we believe this partnership will better enable our ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnLsnv"&gt;In considering possible partners, all roads ultimately lead to Microsoft. Like us, they have been making games for a long time. Microsoft has already distributed games to hundreds of millions of the world’s computers and computing devices and has technologies and innovation that will support the next generation of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uaSGV"&gt;Microsoft also will support our journey to further strengthen our culture. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, has been a passionate advocate for caring as the currency of leadership. Inspiring people through empathy is a powerful motivator, and one we embrace as we renew our resolve – and in the work we are now doing – to set a new standard for a welcoming and inclusive workplace culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2ugL1"&gt;Importantly, Microsoft wants you – your talent, your creativity, and your dedication to each other. Activision Blizzard’s success throughout the years can be directly attributed to each of you. Microsoft recognizes the commitment to excellence and creative independence that sets us apart, and we anticipate minimal changes for our workforce following the close of the transaction. Microsoft’s diverse operations will give us access to valuable expertise, technology, and tools and provide even greater opportunities for learning and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMlctq"&gt;No organization’s culture, including ours, is without need for improvement, and thanks to your input, we are making strides in improving ours. My commitment is to continue evolving our culture so that come closing, Microsoft is acquiring an exemplary workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtlTXD"&gt;What’s next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udSDvv"&gt;Transactions like these can take a long time to complete. Until we receive all the necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions are satisfied, which we expect to be sometime in Microsoft’s fiscal 2023 year ending June 30, 2023, we will continue to operate completely autonomously. I will continue as our CEO with the same passion and enthusiasm I had when I began this amazing journey in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmi1qL"&gt;Of course, this announcement will give rise to so many questions. We will host numerous forums and events to make certain we address your concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAQl2d"&gt;I am incredibly proud of this company, you, and the work we have done together. Now it’s on to our next chapter and the endless possibilities this transaction represents for us. I couldn’t be more appreciative of your efforts, focus, and the dedication to connecting the world through joy and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UghpN5"&gt;With gratitude,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDSgzr"&gt;Bobby&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dkwUeW"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Kotick published a letter&lt;/a&gt; explaining that he and the company were “committed to long-lasting change.” However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;employees later stated&lt;/a&gt; that the message failed “to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns,” including issues like forced arbitration (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;which finally ended last month&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nF11sr"&gt;More recently, Blizzard co-lead Jen Oneal, who took on the role as the studio’s leadership shifted in the wake of the lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;stepped down after only three months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, Oneal was paid less than her male counterpart (former Xbox exec Mike Ybarra) and wrote in an email to the company’s legal team that she had been “tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against.” Oneal told employees that Activision Blizzard only offered her equal pay after she had tendered her resignation, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-jen-oneal-mike-ybarra-equal-pay-after-resignation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Daniel Radcliffe’s about to get real weird in Roku’s Al Yankovic biopic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daniel Radcliffe Talks To Host Hoda Kotb At SiriusXM’s New York Studios" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EMUq1FzGefPcaoOSddXaRq4JVoQ=/80x216:2435x1786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403769/1334885334.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n3L9Af"&gt;Today, Roku, Funny Or Die, and Tango announced that they’re partnering up to produce &lt;em&gt;WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story&lt;/em&gt;, a biopic written by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/18/14658500/weird-al-unreleased-beatles-parody-pac-man"&gt;“Weird Al” Yankovic&lt;/a&gt; and director Eric Appel, with Daniel Radcliffe attached to star in the lead role. In a statement about the upcoming film, Yankovic spoke about how he sees &lt;em&gt;WEIRD &lt;/em&gt;as his making good on a promise to maintain a dedicated presence in the film space over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8u5M6"&gt;“When my last movie &lt;em&gt;UHF&lt;/em&gt; came out in 1989, I made a solemn vow to my fans that I would release a major motion picture every 33 years, like clockwork. I’m very happy to say we’re on schedule,” Yankovic said. “I am absolutely thrilled that Daniel Radcliffe will be portraying me in the film. I have no doubt whatsoever that this is the role future generations will remember him for.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqxbcB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UHF&lt;/em&gt;, a movie about a man who suddenly gains ownership of a TV station, becoming a cult classic after initially flopping when it hit theaters in 1989 is a testament to his ability to make art that sticks in people’s minds even if they don’t exactly understand its appeal at the time. While no other casting news has currently been announced, one imagines that &lt;em&gt;WEIRD &lt;/em&gt;will feature its fair share of Yankovic’s music, either in recreations of the moments when the musician was first working through them or at significant points in his career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7NJWb"&gt;Though &lt;em&gt;WEIRD &lt;/em&gt;could logically end up skewing so comedic to the point that people don’t come into the movie thinking they should take it seriously, both Yankovic and Radcliffe are the types to zig when you expect them to zag, meaning that the new movie might actually be something to keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfJf3I"&gt;Production on &lt;em&gt;WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story &lt;/em&gt;is slated to begin in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making sense of new TV features in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zfv8vXMoTrVEZA7t63WnBY-CDTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403767/cwelch_211209_4929_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a TV can be a confusing ordeal, but it doesn’t need to be&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="FPbhac"&gt;Every year after CES, there can be a new pile of buzzwords and technology shorthand that can go up and over the head of many consumers — even when those acronyms often describe meaningful advancements that are worth knowing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iAPmK"&gt;So with all the latest TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL, Hisense, and others now announced and due to ship over the next few months, it seems an opportune moment to review the features you should be looking for when TV shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZbS1G"&gt;Stay tuned over the coming months for TV and soundbar buying guides. But if you’re in the market for a new TV &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, these are the terms you should be looking for when comparing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IlC419"&gt;What TV hardware features mean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EwF6PQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALLM:&lt;/strong&gt; Auto low latency mode is a useful feature that detects when you’ve plugged a gaming system into your TV (or have started playing a game on a streaming box) and automatically activates the TV’s “game” mode with optimized settings that produce the lowest possible input lag. This means there will be a minimal delay between you pressing a button on the controller and seeing the resulting action in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28AyZw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dolby Atmos:&lt;/strong&gt; An immersive surround sound format that goes beyond previous experiences by introducing height channels, which make audio more three-dimensional. Atmos home theater systems and soundbars often include up-firing speakers to make some on-screen action sound like it’s happening overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mh7xse"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eARC:&lt;/strong&gt; The enhanced audio return channel is usually labeled on one of your TV’s HDMI ports. This is the port you’ll want to plug your soundbar or home theater system into. On modern TVs, eARC allows for the transmission of uncompressed, immersive 7.1 Dolby Atmos surround sound and eliminates the extremely frustrating audio sync frustrations that can be present when using soundbars on some older TVs. Definitely make sure your next TV has eARC among its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv8hQq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDMI 2.1: &lt;/strong&gt;The “definition” of HDMI 2.1 was recently thrown into disarray when it was discovered that a device or HDMI cable being labeled as compliant with the 2.1 spec &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833233/hdmi-2-1-fake-marketing-brand-frl-vrr-allm-bandwidth"&gt;doesn’t actually guarantee anything&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of focusing on HDMI 2.1, the best practice for consumers is now to check for the specific features like 4K at 120Hz, VRR, and others mentioned in this list. In terms of cables, looking for something that supports 48Gbps throughput is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZatX6_01clx2u87OQkl6HnSrXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23169394/PXL_20211207_175050122.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="azry1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDR: &lt;/strong&gt;High dynamic range is a must-have feature for any TV in 2022. It produces much brighter highlights and deeper, more vivid colors when playing HDR content. Aside from the basic, widely supported HDR10 format, other HDR formats include Dolby Vision, which allows for different picture optimizations on a frame-by-frame basis, and HDR10 Plus, which offers similar benefits but with a smaller content selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXJVTy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MicroLED:&lt;/strong&gt; Throw out everything you know about regular TVs. Samsung’s MicroLED displays bring together the best features of OLED — self-emitting pixels, perfect blacks, and so on — without most of the drawbacks. MicroLEDs use microscopic, inorganic LEDs that individually produce light and color. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ccl3h-ACe8nplg7dofAAJqaNGQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9993913/DSCF2719.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A close-up of Samsung’s MicroLED display technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xam34T"&gt;These micrometer-scale LEDs are transferred onto tile-like modules, allowing for a display of various shapes and potentially any size. Samsung also sells more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;TV-like MicroLED displays&lt;/a&gt; at preset sizes. But, unfortunately for most of us, since MicroLED is still a new and costly technology, it’s wildly expensive, and these displays cost more than most cars. (Think over $100,000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXDwNs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini LED:&lt;/strong&gt; For the past several years, many of the best LCD TVs have used a backlighting system called “full-array local dimming” with a number of individual LEDs behind the screen that illuminate and dim in accordance with the content being shown. These LEDs form dimming “zones” that allow some areas of the screen to be very dark while other sections might simultaneously be powerfully bright with HDR content. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgjZx9C33x5C7_KPoj2F3hYSNJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23169207/miniled.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psuBWd"&gt;Mini LED iterates upon that approach by shrinking the LEDs significantly — and cramming many, many more of them into the backlight array. The end result is more precise contrast and less “blooming,” which occurs when a halo of light can be seen around bright objects or text on screen. Mini LED doesn’t eliminate blooming altogether, but it’s often less noticeable. All those tiny LEDs also make for better overall brightness uniformity across the TV’s display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1K2Qn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLED:&lt;/strong&gt; They’ve long been hailed as the best TVs you can buy for a reason: OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TVs offer perfect blacks thanks to their self-emissive pixels and no need for a traditional backlight. Viewing angles are stellar, contrast is unrivaled, and OLED can make practically anything you put on the screen shine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ydSRDa23gWaRpP6RiJIgFQKigA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128690/cwelch_211209_4929_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLED TVs offer unbeatable, perfect black levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PdJQOj"&gt;That said, OLED TVs aren’t perfect at &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;: they usually trail LCD TVs in overall brightness, and the possibility of permanent burn-in hasn’t yet been overcome, even if LG, Sony, and other OLED TV makers have measures in place that make the problem very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KcFfJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QD-OLED: &lt;/strong&gt;CES 2022 marked the big debut of QD-OLED panels on both TVs and gaming monitors. These &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876061/samsung-qd-oled-quantum-dot-tv-panels-sgs-certification-brightness-color-viewing-angles"&gt;quantum dot OLED displays&lt;/a&gt; are made by Samsung Display and differ from those manufactured by LG Display because they offer true RGB color reproduction and can maintain vivid colors across the brightness range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d698PA"&gt;Traditional OLEDs emit light through a color filter, but QD-OLED beams blue light through quantum dots to create red and green and produce the rest of the color spectrum. This more efficient approach has benefits, including improved overall brightness levels and even better viewing angles than OLED already offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwz71G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10961963"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LnmLLP"&gt;The first QD-OLED TVs are expected to ship in 2022 and are likely to cost noticeably more than those from LG, so we’ll need some actual hands-on time to determine if these upgraded panels are worth the price premium. But it’s still exciting to see the best TV tech (that normal people can potentially afford) continue to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNYfK0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VRR:&lt;/strong&gt; The latest TVs with variable refresh rate allow games on a PS5 or Xbox Series S / X to adjust their refresh rate at up to 120Hz for much smoother on-screen action. (In 2022, some TVs will increase this as high as 144Hz for PC gaming.) VRR also proves helpful at smoothing out any brief hitches or drops in frame rate to the point that they’re often unnoticeable, letting you focus on the game itself instead of your console’s technical performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OuEw6q"&gt;Terms you should ignore and / or avoid in 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AyMjBS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8K:&lt;/strong&gt; Manufacturers continue to produce new 8K TV models each year, but the entertainment industry as a whole still hasn’t made a dent in the biggest problem area: there’s still a dearth of native 8K content that’s easy to stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cXZse"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge-lit LED: &lt;/strong&gt;Cheaper LCD TVs will often have edge lighting — with LEDs around the perimeter of the screen instead of behind it — that results in significantly worse picture quality, uneven uniformity, and mediocre black levels compared to sets with local dimming. It can be enticing to buy a giant-sized TV at a low price, but as the old saying goes, if it’s too good to be true, it usually is. &lt;/p&gt;
