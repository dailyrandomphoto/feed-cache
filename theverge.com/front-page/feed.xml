    <title>The PS5 now has a YouTube TV app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25Ntq96TzeZMldyEVsk0uaDDiOo=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246380/vpavic_4261_20201023_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxBn52"&gt;The PlayStation 5 &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129767#zippy=%2Cmobile-devices-computers%2Cstreaming-media-players-smart-tvs-game-consoles"&gt;now has a YouTube TV app&lt;/a&gt;, arriving more than six months after the console launched. That means anyone lucky enough to actually buy Sony’s latest console now has another way to watch live TV on it, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/05/youtube-tv-arrives-on-ps5-just-in-time-to-pick-up-ex-roku-viewers/"&gt;as first spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MSOBJ"&gt;YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;costs $64.99 per month&lt;/a&gt; (not counting additional extras) and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7286228?hl=en"&gt;allows up to three simultaneous streams&lt;/a&gt; within a household, which could be useful if your PS5 is hooked up in another room from your main TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5pLr1"&gt;Having another device that works with YouTube TV could be especially helpful for Roku owners, given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;ongoing feud between Google and Roku&lt;/a&gt; that has seen YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;removed from Roku’s channel store&lt;/a&gt;. (That means new Roku owners can’t install or re-download the app if they don’t already have it on their device.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOOF1t"&gt;Admittedly, the Venn diagram of “PS5 owners who subscribe to YouTube TV and also own a Roku device that didn’t already have the YouTube TV app” is certainly vanishing small. But in a world where corporate disputes can mean losing access to the services you pay for on the devices you already own at the drop of a hat, having more streaming options is never a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scrap new gas infrastructure, says UN report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Valley Generating Station has been reported to have been leaking methane since 2019." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQ5-6l98WvAItMy_mHrXvgsPdFU=/1x0:5200x3466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246299/1297810377.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Graffiti outside the Valley Generating Station, a natural gas power plant reported to have been leaking methane in California since 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Citizen of the Planet//Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FGOIKc"&gt;A major new United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/global-methane-assessment-benefits-and-costs-mitigating-methane-emissions"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; makes it extremely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;clear that relying on natural gas won’t help the world avoid climate catastrophe. Once seen as a “bridge fuel” that could provide a less-polluting alternative to coal and other fossil fuels, growing &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6398/186"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that gas is a bigger culprit in the climate crisis than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAifgZ"&gt;Though it’s been attractively&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;branded as “natural” gas, the fuel is primarily plain old&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;methane. When burned, the fuel does&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;produce less carbon dioxide than coal and oil. The problem is that extracting so-called natural gas and bringing it to homes and buildings leads to a lot of methane leaks. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, with more than 80 times more power to warm the planet than carbon dioxide &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;especially in the first couple decades after it’s unleashed on the atmosphere. In fact, methane has been responsible for nearly a third of global warming that’s already taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6USWjt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CPRkmU"&gt;Human-caused methane emissions will need to drop by 45 percent this decade in order to avoid worst-case climate scenarios and meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, the United Nations report warns. Expanding natural gas consumption and infrastructure would jeopardize those targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPny5T"&gt;“One thing the report calls for very strongly is not building any more of this fossil fuel infrastructure,” Drew Shindell, lead author of the report and a professor at Duke University, said in a press conference. “When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KrN6EX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How your gas stove sparked a battle over climate change ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="j6aboI"&gt;Fortunately, achieving those methane cuts is affordable and possible with existing technology, according to the report. For starters, fossil fuel industries need to do a better job of preventing leaks. But that alone won’t be enough. In the long run, keeping the current fossil fuel infrastructure would derail efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. And while emerging technologies that capture carbon dioxide from polluting power plants might do some good, “there are multiple risks that this technology will not work, will be too expensive, and/or will have so many side effects that society will not want to use it,” according to the report. Bottom line: the report calls for a sweeping transition to renewable energy, which it says would “remove the bulk of methane emissions” in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW0qwj"&gt;Agriculture and waste are other sectors with major methane footprints, making up 40 percent and 20 percent of human-caused emissions, respectively. So the report also calls for reducing meat and dairy in diets, and cutting food waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KZn608"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Scientists created this seaweed to save the planet|100209" data-volume-uuid="6b92fbb78" data-volume-id="100209" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-936" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oarxr2"&gt;Slashing methane is also good for air quality, since it is one of the pollutants that contributes to smog. So cutting methane by 45 percent this decade wouldn’t just be good for the climate. It could also prevent 255,000 premature deaths and 775,000 asthma-related hospital visits each year, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eOTogt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most immediate benefits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98kURx"&gt;The United Nation’s new findings on methane follow a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;2018 report on carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, which called for a similar reduction in carbon dioxide this decade. While CO2 has gained the most notoriety as a greenhouse gas, methane is now in the spotlight. While CO2 can linger in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years, methane is much shorter-lived — it can&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dissipate within a decade. That ultimately means that, while eliminating carbon dioxide emissions is vital, taking on methane could lead to the most immediate benefits for people and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mv63s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLxM35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags have a hidden developer menu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A purple iPhone 12 and an AirTag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVPzQi3osLLB8rr10SVxtVnh3c0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246227/vpavic_4547_20210421_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p5mLXF"&gt;Apple’s new item-tracking AirTags have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt;, and they come with a surprise addition: a hidden menu in the Find My app that reveals some of the back-end data used by the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymdrEI"&gt;To uncover this menu, open up Apple’s Find My app, select one of your AirTags, then tap your name in the top left corner five times. And just like Dorothy clicking her heels together, you’ll be whisked away to a comforting world of, well, sliders and data. It’s not clear what all the information means, though some of the labels (like “device pitch”) are obvious enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzgAVG"&gt;The menu seems to be an accidental remnant of Apple’s development process, with the information presumably left over from an early beta version of the Find My app. Think of it like builders leaving architectural plans under the floorboards of a house they’re constructing. This is normal stuff, you just don’t usually see it (especially from Apple). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E7Fb1OXOOrQ93BE4LM1fBa8o1Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495868/apple_airtags_developer_menu.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can access the menu by tapping in your name five times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IpZDmC"&gt;The menu itself was discovered by a self-described “frustrated” AirTags user on Reddit, who was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/n5vtle/frustration_lead_to_airtag_hidden_dev_mode"&gt;tapping around the app in annoyance&lt;/a&gt; when they uncovered the information. We were able to verify that the menu works with our own devices, as have plenty of people on Twitter, which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robertrosenfeld/status/1390178011920535553"&gt;where we first saw&lt;/a&gt; this accidental Easter egg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGbPWb"&gt;Over on Reddit, one user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/n5vtle/frustration_lead_to_airtag_hidden_dev_mode/gx3xqnd?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the bottom four sliders actually relate to the various colors your screen turns as you approach your AirTagged item. “A=% mixed with view; H=hue; S=saturation; V=value/brightness,” says Redditor pmarksen. “The top two sliders relate to camera blur, and brightness. Not sure what the middle ‘sum’ slider does yet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjS6hl"&gt;The “eco mode” label seems to refer to a battery-saving feature that deploys a smaller screen resolution (the Find My user interfaces includes an AR camera overlay that directs you to your item), while the “dots” options apparently refer to the number of dots that swarm on the screen as part of the animation that shows you approaching your target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVkxFq"&gt;If anyone else has any more hints, clues, or wild speculation about what else the screen shows, please feel free to drop by the comments below. We’ve pinged Apple to ask about this menu and expect to hear only embarrassed silence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will soon switch on two-factor authentication by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWm78hj2lPoo3qANGcE4I5RNOpE=/0x100:2100x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69246166/twostep.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lhFBFo"&gt;Google is about to take a pretty significant step that will help keep user accounts more secure: it’s going to enroll people in two-factor authentication by default. Today the company &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it will soon start enrolling customers in two-factor authentication (or “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;two-step verification&lt;/a&gt;,” as Google calls it) if their accounts are “appropriately configured.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuNxkh"&gt;Once enabled, they’ll receive a prompt on their smartphone to verify that an attempted login with their Google account is legitimate. “Using their mobile device to sign in gives people a safer and more secure authentication experience than passwords alone,” said Google’s senior director of product management, Mark Risher. (On-phone alerts are more secure than SMS messages, which can be intercepted.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc0LzB"&gt;If standard two-factor authentication doesn’t cut it for you, you can always use a physical security key like those from YubiKey, or Google’s own Titan, as another way to safeguard your account. Back in 2019, Google also added the option for Android smartphones to serve as a security key, and this has since &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-smart-lock/id1152066360"&gt;been extended to iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc3Tad"&gt;This is all part of Google’s push for “a future where one day you won’t need a password at all,” and the news comes on World Password Day. Distressingly, even after countless enormous hacks and password dumps, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; 66 percent of Americans “still admit to using the same password across multiple sites, which makes all those accounts vulnerable if any one falls.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BKcQC"&gt;Google advises customers to go through the company’s quick security checkup to ensure their settings and account protections are where they should be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emGA8ro9D4lNLBPQkh0oh092_xQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66870539/acastro_200323_1777_gamingMouse_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever your budget or grip style is, we’ve found the best gaming mouse for you.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Multiple picks for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IQp8AK"&gt;Finding the right gaming mouse amid all the options available can be a struggle. There are a lot of factors to consider, like how it looks, how it feels in the hand, the button selection and arrangement, the quality of its sensor, and whether you want a mouse that’s wireless or wired. These details, minor as they seem, can have a major impact on your experience with the mouse you choose to buy. On the other hand, sometimes mice have features that get overblown and don’t actually work as well as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOD0oD"&gt;However your taste leans, you almost certainly want the best wireless gaming mouse that your budget allows for. We’re going to make this decision easy for you. The best gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most well-rounded choice if you want comfort, a long-lasting battery, and the best selection and arrangement of buttons. The model’s design accommodates multiple grip styles, and Logitech’s companion software is unobtrusive and a breeze to use. It also has rock-solid wireless connectivity so you don’t have to deal with a wire entangling your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbAxZF"&gt;If you don’t want a wireless mouse and are looking for the best wired gaming mouse, look no further than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;Razer DeathAdder V2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unbeatable in the ergonomics department, with a design that feels like a natural extension of your hand. And while this model has a fairly simple layout and button selection, it’s all just within reach and responsive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBKPjC"&gt;That’s not to say that several mice released more recently haven’t tested the throne, so to speak. Our latest update ropes in a few of the latest wireless and wired models from Logitech, Razer, SteelSeries, and other brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3lO4oA"&gt;The best wireless gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjQweePnmr6NqW900etrvOctA34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219644/akrales_190507_3407_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GenFNF"&gt;The Logitech G502 Lightspeed is a great gaming mouse for discerning gamers who don’t want to compromise, as well as people who have no idea what they should look for in a mouse. It’s comfortable, feature-packed, and even though it’s wireless, it’s a fast and accurate performer that doesn’t feel at a disadvantage against opponents using wired mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJdIHm"&gt;At $150 (though sometimes sold for around $100 these days), the best doesn’t come cheap. But if you’ve tossed around the idea of making an investment in a high-end wireless mouse, no other model that I tested for this buying guide justified its price so easily. The G502 Lightspeed has Logitech’s best features for its gaming and general-use mice rolled into one. The main buttons deliver a satisfying bounce response when you tap them, and unlike some other popular models, they click easily no matter how you grip your hand on the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIq7sZ"&gt;This mouse also features a quick-release button, a feature borrowed from other Logitech consumer-focused and gaming mice. By default, the scroll wheel staggers down a webpage with each step, which is how you expect a scroll wheel to work. Tapping the button releases the mechanism gripping the wheel, allowing it to freely sail to the bottom of a long page. It’s a small feature, but one that gives the mouse more versatility in certain situations, like being able to quickly scroll through your inventory when in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRLAe6Nq6SE9DoYoV5sxbZJTxrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219645/akrales_190507_3407_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Lightspeed may not have the most inviting design, but it’s incredibly comfortable to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q3DLU"&gt;Another nice feature is the inclusion of 16 grams of additional weights you can insert into the mouse to give it more resistance. A mouse’s weight comes down to personal preference, and that could vary from game to game. This mouse is among the few modern wireless devices to give you the flexibility to change up the weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2V6RE"&gt;The fact that the G502 Lightspeed is wireless makes it that much easier to bring along with you wherever you go. But if you just can’t swing the $150 price, I suggest that you check out the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;, which is the wired version of this mouse. It has almost every feature that you’ll find in the wireless model — except, you know, wireless capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBe8su"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SUnjee"&gt;Before moving on, it’s worth mentioning where Logitech’s lineup of wireless gaming mice fits in comparison. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight"&gt;G Pro X Superlight&lt;/a&gt; is a $150 option made for people who want a very lightweight mouse. It has the same Hero 25K sensor, so the tracking is just as good as the G502 Lightspeed, but it doesn’t have any extra features. In addition to being far lighter, it’s more plainly designed, with far fewer buttons. In fact, it’s pricier and has fewer buttons than the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726261308666686391" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;G Pro Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjhWDI"&gt;You’ll likely know if this is something you’d want more than our top pick, but since it’s more expensive than our top pick and less ergonomic, we still recommend the G502 Lightspeed for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1K4jR3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7xlEt"&gt;The runner-up: Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE ($90)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSLoek"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cheaper alternative to the best wireless gaming mouse &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34H4GpKR93Xz1ejL3_3XCarRxQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984098/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0001.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="elmLGV"&gt;Corsair’s Dark Core RGB Pro SE high-end wireless gaming mouse comes dangerously close to dethroning our top pick. It has a comfortable, ergonomic build with a high arch that makes it easy to relax with during long gameplay sessions or to power through work. Its design is less angular and sharp-looking than the G502 Lightspeed, so you might take to it more quickly based on looks alone. Though, when I’m not paying attention to how the two mice differ in appearance, they feel equally comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxusJS"&gt;It offers USB-C charging and supports Qi wireless charging if you have a wireless charger. This mouse can switch between 2.4GHz wireless mode via its included USB dongle (cleverly tucked under its removable, magnetic wing), or Bluetooth. Of course, you’ll get better results by using the dongle, but it’s great to have options. I found that the battery life, while decent, wasn’t quite as long-lasting as the G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOpEA3"&gt;Some smaller, but equally welcome, features here come in the form of that removable magnetic wing I just mentioned, which snaps onto its right side to let me comfortably rest my ring and pinky fingers on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYHfoi"&gt;The Dark Core held up nearly just as well in-game as Logitech’s mouse above, though the omission of two features made me miss using the G502 Lightspeed. It doesn’t have a dedicated sniper button, and there were a few instances where the model that I tested had a squeaky left mouse button. I don’t think it made a noise more than once every few hundred clicks, and it was tough to replicate it when I tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKufKm"&gt;Outside of the price differences, these two play a game of teeter-totter with features. Depending on who you ask, the Dark Core might have one or two up on the G502 Lightspeed. But Logitech’s mouse edges it out with better build quality, extra buttons (not to mention the excellent scroll wheel), and optional weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kf7Lfe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221795"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4N7EgV"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuU0vB9iDARo3BEjlybhYFTMpiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21996070/steelseriesaerox3hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SteelSeries&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bgfFJw"&gt;Other good wireless options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MfOTnc"&gt;The SteelSeries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21538891/steelseries-aerox-3-gaming-mouse-wireless-lightweight-honeycomb-water-resistant-usb-c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aerox 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; weighs significantly less than the top and runner-up picks at just 66 grams. That’s a big perk, as is its USB-C charging, which is still a rarity among other popular models from Razer and Logitech. It can operate on 2.4GHz wireless with its included USB-C dongle, or Bluetooth, and the Aerox 3 Wireless features an IP54 rating to protect it from some water and dust. It isn’t as ergonomic as the options above. While that might not be much of an issue for people who use it simply to game, it’s not particularly comfortable to use as an all-day device. Also, I noticed that it loses connection with my PC regularly, but rather than a connectivity issue, it seems like it falls asleep to preserve power if you don’t use it for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TR1BuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GoOPfo"&gt;Though, you don’t have to pay around $100 to get a solid wireless mouse that’s made for gaming. The $69.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403511/razer-orochi-v2-wireless-gaming-mouse-battery-life-custom-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Orochi V2&lt;/a&gt; improves on Razer’s previous battery-operated gaming mouse, the Basilisk X Hyperspeed, in some big ways. The marquee feature is its long-lasting battery life. Razer claims that a single AA battery can last for up to 950 hours in this mouse’s Bluetooth mode (or up to 425 hours by switching the bottom-mounted toggle over to the 2.4GHz Hyperspeed mode that offers lower latency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPLqgj"&gt;The Orochi V2 is an ambidextrous mouse, though it only features thumb buttons that cater to right-handed gamers. It has a similar arch in the palm section to the Basilisk X Hyperspeed that should cater to people who use a palm or fingertip grip in and out of gaming, though it’s more compact than most of Razer’s other gaming mice and might not fit larger hands well. Given the low price, you won’t find Razer’s best sensor inside, nor are there optical switches under the mouse buttons for the fastest performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8NyiUd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10481049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2q8aDd"&gt;The best wired gaming mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2 ($70)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best wired gaming mouse: Razer DeathAdder V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPODoDBPSU6YYV9veJq7J9hKMOA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832658/deathadderv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAQPG"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 is proof that a wired mouse doesn’t need countless features to be worth the money. It just needs to be extremely good at the fundamentals, including being comfy enough to use for hours at a time with games that require quick reflexes, having a simple assortment of buttons that take little to no time to master, and, of course, great performance. If this matches what you want in a mouse, the $70 Razer DeathAdder V2 is the one you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oR5KE"&gt;Of all the wired gaming mice that I tested for this buying guide, no other mouse felt like a more natural extension of my hand. That’s crucial when you’re playing a game that requires precision, and it’s good to have when you just want to feel support while you’re using your computer in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HHFi1"&gt;The DeathAdder V2’s design provides a lot of palm support, whether my fingers are flat and relaxed over the mouse or arched when I need to use faster reflexes. I use my index finger to left click and middle finger to right click; unlike most mice, this design gives me enough space on its right side to keep my ring and pinky fingers from dangling off the side and dragging on the mouse pad. That’s something I didn’t know I wanted out of a mouse until I started using this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWZiOf"&gt;Those design features keep things comfortable, but I think the part of the mouse that sold me is where my thumb rests. Many mice etch out an area for your thumb to relax and laze around. That’s fine, but I find that it necessitates more arm movement when the action ramps up. I prefer this mouse’s solution: its ergonomic design keeps my thumb wrapped around its side, naturally resting upon the edges of the customizable macro buttons. It’s good to have multiple buttons within reach, and the thumb location makes it easy for me to push the mouse around using just my wrist. It’s comfortable and has the dual purpose of keeping me limber in case I need to make sudden movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDrU52"&gt;(Note: It’s worth mentioning before digging into specs that this mouse is rather large. If you want something a little smaller, but with the same design perks, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3K9K6P/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the $49.99 DeathAdder V2 Mini&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the same sensor as the larger model, topping out at 8,500 DPI versus 20,000, but the complimentary grip tape that’s included is a small consolation. Alternatively, if you like the larger size of the DeathAdder V2, but want a wireless version instead, you can get that in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FQMBKQG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DeathAdder V2 Pro, usually less than $100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="20uVFV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zVjY6B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fjlknf"&gt;The runner-up: BenQ Zowie’s EC2 ($69)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="BenQ Zowie EC2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hE1MusijcYopmb66zVUU8Kdn6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984101/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IyFgOW"&gt;BenQ Zowie’s EC2 may be an equally good, if not better, option for some people. This $69.99 mouse is my favorite of the company’s current catalog. It’s shaped similarly to the DeathAdder V2, in that it’s ergonomic and sloped to give your palm a comfortable surface to lay on while you game or browse. What’s more, there’s a generous amount of thumb space underneath the side buttons that I found to be spacious and equally accommodating to my grip style. All of Zowie’s mice are delightfully no-frills in terms of their design, but the EC2 is the most curvy mouse the company offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8OiDu4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221807"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oXpaI"&gt;The no-frills philosophy extends into the feature offering, but that’s not to say it’s lacking. I think the EC2 offers exactly what most gamers need, and perhaps of equal importance, nothing they don’t. This mouse features four buttons (two main, two side) and a DPI button that can be adjusted on the mouse’s bottom side. Even the more advanced settings, like adjusting lift-off distance or USB report rate, are done by holding down a unique sequence of buttons when you plug it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VyYR8X"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sBIvEu"&gt;Other good wired options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TeVjwP"&gt;If $150 for Logitech’s wireless G502 Lightspeed is too much for you to spend, you might want to consider this wired version, the G502 Hero. It has the same design as our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse — actually, it’s basically the same in almost every way, down to the kind of sensor it uses and its adjustable weights. That makes it almost as good, though some might take issue with its thick braided cable and the somewhat slippery plastic used on the scroll wheel that isn’t on the Lightspeed model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm9W6Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs4a0r"&gt;The Basilisk V2 is the wired mouse that I’d recommend to people who want the advantages of a modern Razer wired mouse, like the thin, braided SpeedFlex cable, fast performance, PTFE feet that let the mouse glide across your mouse pad, and, of course, LEDs. Despite having a design that might not fit well in everyone’s hands, it’s a smaller mouse that has more features than the DeathAdder V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I15iEA"&gt;For instance, the Basilisk V2 has a removable sniper button that’s easy to reach. Perhaps my favorite feature here is the scroll wheel that has an adjustable tension. It’s not quite as cool as the Logitech G502’s free-spinning wheel, but you’ll probably love it if you want a custom feel to your wheel. One of the best things about this mouse is that it has most of the same features found in the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20947669/razer-wireless-basilisk-gaming-pc-mouse-ultimate-x-hyperspeed-battery-life-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Basilisk Ultimate, Razer’s wireless version of this mouse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gmcFzc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TsB5ht"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="KPe1W2"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="VPma8f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC’s net neutrality rollback overwhelmed by bogus industry comments, investigation finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QSqM8Dvd26U66M6DHGCfUmIfnbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245936/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYHvRZ"&gt;The New York attorney general’s office &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag-fakecommentsreport.pdf"&gt;issued a report Thursday&lt;/a&gt; confirming that some of the US’s largest broadband providers engaged in a massive campaign to flood the Federal Communications Commission with fake comments in the run-up to the commission’s 2017 order to roll back net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZBrUr"&gt;The attorney general’s multi-year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16686644/eric-schneiderman-fcc-net-neutrality-spam-investigation-evidence"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found that fake comments accounted for the vast majority of comments received in response to the order — nearly 18 million, out of a total of 22 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fc15G3"&gt;Out of those 18 million, 8.5 million were submitted through a process called “co-registration,” which saw outside companies promising “gift cards and sweepstakes entries” in order to attract consumers to join in the campaign. They would then use that information to file form responses to the order, even as the people behind the comments had no idea their names had been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iT0dTD"&gt;According to the report, many of these companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15610744/anti-net-neutrality-fake-comments-identities"&gt;filed fake consumer responses&lt;/a&gt; as well. More than half a million fake letters to Congress were also fabricated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AyfVK"&gt;The attorney general’s office found that the largest groups funding this influence campaign were three of the largest telecom companies in the US, together with an industry trade group. All told, the parties represented more than 65 million subscribers and a combined market value of half a trillion dollars.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zB7r1"&gt;“The public record should be a place for honest dialogue, but today’s report demonstrates how the record informing the FCC’s net neutrality repeal was flooded with fraud. This was troubling at the time because even then the widespread problems with the record were apparent,” FCC Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Thursday. “We have to learn from these lessons and improve because the public deserves an open and fair opportunity to tell Washington what they think about the policies that affect their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruwBSg"&gt;The three main companies found to have falsely influenced the FCC’s rollback — Fluent, React2Media, and Opt-Intelligence — entered into settlements with the attorney general’s office, requiring the companies to pay over $4 million in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT6nip"&gt;The attorney general’s office also found 9.3 million fake comments were sent to the FCC in support of net neutrality using false identities. “Most of these comments were submitted by a single person — a 19-year-old college student using automated software,” James said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFGNbf"&gt;“Americans’ voices are being drowned out by masses of fake comments and messages being submitted to the government to sway decision-making,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-issues-report-detailing-millions-fake-comments-revealing"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. “Instead of actually looking for real responses from the American people, marketing companies are luring vulnerable individuals to their websites with freebies, co-opting their identities, and fabricating responses that giant corporations are then using to influence the policies and laws that govern our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5dnfr"&gt;Concerns were raised about automated commenting during the comment period, with a number of media outlets reporting on comments filed either by dead people or people who had no recollection of filing a comment. The New York attorney general’s office began investigating the claims &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990758/net-neutrality-fcc-new-york-attorney-general-investigation"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a month before the FCC was set to vote to repeal the Obama-era net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejI7WR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated May 6th, 2021 at 11:08AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included a statement from FCC Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft would like to remind you the Xbox definitely makes money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbrUG6gAiTeugzAcK4eE2EsejnE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245901/vpavic_4275_20201030_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OokXO"&gt;A Microsoft executive has admitted that the company doesn’t earn any profit on sales of Xbox consoles alone. The admission came as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial yesterday, confirming what we’ve known for years: Microsoft sells Xbox consoles at a loss. Asked how much margin Microsoft makes on Xbox consoles, the company’s head of Xbox business development, Lori Wright, said, “We don’t; we sell the consoles at a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuDVqw"&gt;An Epic Games lawyer asked a follow-up question: “Does Microsoft ever earn a profit on the sale of an Xbox console?” Wright replied, “No.” That doesn’t mean Xbox doesn’t make money, though. Microsoft was keen to point this out in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; just hours after Wright’s testimony yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVnfkQ"&gt;“The gaming business is a profitable and high-growth business for Microsoft,” says a Microsoft spokesperson. “The console gaming business is traditionally a hardware subsidy model. Game companies sell consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are generated in game sales and online service subscriptions.“&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FEUW7o0SLmMH0yrqGsPtZ6aOk0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22013076/vpavic_201103_4275_0252.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Series S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NFgB6W"&gt;I asked Microsoft whether it never truly makes any margins on hardware alone, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication. Typically, Microsoft and Sony subsidize hardware at the beginning of a console’s lifecycle, but those early component costs tend to decrease over time. Those lower costs also translate to lower retail prices for consoles over time, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VhHN5"&gt;A teardown analysis of the Xbox One S, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160805005103/en/IHS-Markit-Teardown-Analysis-Microsoft%E2%80%99s-Xbox-One-S-Brings-Significant-Value-Gains-with-Minimal-Commercial-Pain"&gt;revealed an estimated bill of materials&lt;/a&gt; of $324, which is $75 less than the $399 launch price for the 2TB version of the console, back in 2016. Microsoft also launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18309223/microsoft-xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition-price-release-date"&gt;disc-less version of the Xbox One S&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, which was presumably also sold at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjHqYY"&gt;Sony and Microsoft have similar business models for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, but Nintendo is the exception. In court documents, Microsoft estimates that hardware is generating a loss for Sony, but a profit for Nintendo. That’s backed up by Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;impressive 84.59 million Switch sales&lt;/a&gt; this year, up to March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. Epic isn’t happy about Apple’s 30 percent revenue cut on in-app purchases for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Apple is arguing that Epic should also take issue with Microsoft or Sony’s identical 30 percent cut. It has resulted in hours of testimony about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;whether the iPhone is more like a PC or an Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and a debate around open platforms versus locked-down ones. Microsoft clearly sees a difference between Xbox and PC, and has only cut the amount it takes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;on the Windows side to 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;, while the Xbox remains at 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CHG6Y"&gt;Microsoft obviously wants to maintain its business model for Xbox, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4445984/xbox-one-policy-reversal-changes"&gt;attempted to push&lt;/a&gt; the industry toward digital games for years. Microsoft has very much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;sided with Epic Games in the case against Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic has admitted it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;never even questioned&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s digital sales cut. But how long this harmony will exist between the pair will very much depend on the future of digital game sales and cloud gaming. Microsoft is increasingly focused on its Xbox Game Pass subscription, which spans across devices that aren’t even Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCjUkY"&gt;Game Pass also includes xCloud, Microsoft’s cloud gaming technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;isn’t part of xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, because Epic Games won’t allow it. That highlights the emerging battles that are starting to take place in the game industry over shares of revenue. It looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415712/microsoft-xbox-store-cut-epic-games-court-documents"&gt;Microsoft has been preparing&lt;/a&gt; for some of them, but &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; feels like the beginning of a greater war over the digital future of game stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The final trailer for A Quiet Place Part II drops over a year after I thought it came out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwJNCs0EL9X7zDY_EPip8t2htI8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245877/a_quiet_place_part_ii_AQP2_03710R_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Jonny Cournoyer / Paramount Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="afYANt"&gt;Over a year after &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; was set to release, Paramount has dropped the final trailer for it. It looks pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08vobL"&gt;Paramount made the decision to pull the movie from the schedule back in March 2020 due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176712/a-quiet-place-part-2-delay-paramount-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;concerns over the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, director and star of the first film &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnkrasinski/status/1238115296017371137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1238115296017371137%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F3%2F12%2F21176712%2Fa-quiet-place-part-2-delay-paramount-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;John Krasinski tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that he was proud of it, but felt it needed to be seen in a theater for true impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5sOyy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpdDN9d9Jio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Js27R9"&gt;The problem was Paramount had already blown its marketing budget for the movie when it was pulled from the release schedule. The world premiere was held in New York on March 8th, 2020. Critics saw it and many published glowing first reactions to it. Plenty of my friends saw it in early screenings and told me it was great. Emily Blunt appeared on talk shows hyping it. Billboards and murals went up all over the country with a big March 20th, 2020 release date plastered on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNOGFu"&gt;Then &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;’s release was pulled and, at least in my neighborhood, no one rented the billboards and murals after the release date came and went. Ten-foot tall images of a beleaguered Emily Blunt and her kids making their way through an abandoned city lingered for months in my partially abandoned New York neighborhood. Every day I’d walk my dog on empty streets, and pass by them — weird time capsules of the before time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCilbR"&gt;And I guess I just forgot the film never actually came out. Until today’s final trailer dropped, I just assumed it had come out, and everyone but me saw it, and then Paramount just didn’t put it on Paramount+ for reasons known only to Paramount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqTCDp"&gt;But with millions of Americans vaccinated, and theaters slowly moving toward reopening, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; is finally getting its big release. If you are like me and had assumed it already came out, you can now look forward to May 28th, 2021, when it really will, for totally real this time, be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9EMWc"&gt;And if you’re wary of actually going to a theater, given an alarming number of Americans are unvaccinated for a wide variety of reasons, and you’d prefer to watch it at home as we’ve all learned to consume our big-budget flicks, then good news! Paramount has confirmed &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt; will be on Paramount+ 45 days after it premieres in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iainRg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus Watch gets an always-on display — at the cost of half its battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Piqc2cn4rbtJfTTv3Xqksy4ApRo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245840/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HHoNyQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-watch-software-update-b-48-change-log.1431439/"&gt;OnePlus has released its latest update&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;OnePlus Watch&lt;/a&gt;, adding its promised always-on display mode that was absent on the device when it first launched in April. But being able to always see the time on OnePlus’ smartwatch comes at a big cost, with the company cautioning that the new mode will halve the expected battery life when using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L4Nvx6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Watch review: big, basic, and boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5UeCtn"&gt;The release of the always-on display was surprisingly swift for OnePlus, which announced that it planned to add the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395791/oneplus-watch-smartwatch-always-on-display-update"&gt;just two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;. The company says in a blog post that the B.48 update that adds the new feature will arrive for a “small percentage” of users first, with wider rollout over the coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idjpPy"&gt;In addition to enabling the always-on display, the B.48 update also adds the option to use the OnePlus Watch as a remote camera button, a new “Marathon” workout mode, and other improvements, optimizations, and bug fixes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZZ46m"&gt;While the new always-on display option does fix one of the OnePlus Watch’s glaring absences, the fact that it comes with such a big hit in battery life makes it a tougher trade-off for users (especially given that battery life was one of the watch’s highlights.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkBZVO"&gt;The full OnePlus Watch B.48 update changelog is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OBpZXI"&gt;Add Always-on Display dial*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnSjVO"&gt;Remote Control Camera function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zp0ihA"&gt;Add Marathon workout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FBhkg"&gt;Improvements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3KGgf"&gt;Optimize system UI details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsIhXq"&gt;Fix known issues and improve system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YG0m6P"&gt;*After Always-on Display dial is turned on, the screen remains constantly on. This will lead to increased power consumption. Battery life will be reduced by about half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>This could be your last chance to order gifts that’ll arrive by Mother’s Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kindle Paperwhite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xqhZ5E6a1GmdNFCRSKwUk9hcb-w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245828/akrales_181101_3056_0200.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HRCzbE"&gt;Mother’s Day is Sunday, May 9th. You knew that though. That’s why you already got Mom a gift. Nice going... Wait, you haven’t done that yet? Today is likely the cut-off date for guaranteeing that orders placed online will get where they need to be by Sunday (you may have luck tomorrow, but I wouldn’t push it, personally). So, without further delay, let’s load you up with a few last-minute ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPaTg3"&gt;Firstly, our team has already compiled a big, varied list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;Mother’s Day gift ideas right here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s refreshed to reflect the strange year that 2020 was and that 2021 is proving to be. There are fun gifts in there, as well as practical ones. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EOweJI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10443858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GpZDC0"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is $35 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $95. We’ve seen a slightly lower price on this before, but it’s still a good value if you’re looking for an e-reader that’s waterproof and has a sharp, easy-to-read display. This model is ad-supported, so its lockscreen will display an ad. You can opt out of ads, but it’ll cost you $20, either by purchasing the ad-free version of the Paperwhite, or by paying to disable ads from within the user interface post-purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo1TFk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="AKNl6G"&gt;Amazon conveniently lists out all of its deals on its own tech devices &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=11851273011&amp;amp;ref_=sv_devicesubnav_8&amp;amp;nocache=1620306457330"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/ref=gbps_tit_m-2_27e8_634b04f1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=bf99b579-14ba-44d5-87dd-a98574bc27e8&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=11851273011&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=EPMBBV40RBT0HHHCFKH4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV 4K streaming devices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X/ref=gbps_tit_m-2_27e8_c57d83e0?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=bf99b579-14ba-44d5-87dd-a98574bc27e8&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=11851273011&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=EPMBBV40RBT0HHHCFKH4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/326ed8bd/ref=gbps_tit_m-2_27e8_326ed8bd?showVariations=true&amp;amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=bf99b579-14ba-44d5-87dd-a98574bc27e8&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=11851273011&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=EPMBBV40RBT0HHHCFKH4"&gt;Echo Show smart displays&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="XHizi7"&gt;Logitech’s excellent G502 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse is almost $50 off at a few retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739789224930594992#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FLogitech-G502-Lightspeed-Wireless-Optical-Gaming-Mouse-with-RGB-Lighting-%2F203188924516%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F6%2F22422645%2Fmothers-day-tech-gifts-deals-ideas-amazon-kindle-apple-ipad-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy via eBay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $150, it’s down to $104. Check this model out if you’re looking for a wireless model that has several customizable buttons (including one of the best scroll wheels out there), adjustable weight, and a comfortable fit. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s the best wireless gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; for all of those reasons, so take advantage of the deal while you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MWForJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLa2zu"&gt;Apple’s previous &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0862JF4KR/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro with 128GB of storage is $800&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. Since the newer iPad Pro with the M1 chip went up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22409463/apple-m1-imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-preorders-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for preorder&lt;/a&gt;, the price for this model, with the A12Z Bionic processor, has fallen sharply. $800 is the best price on record for this model. This Amazon page says $900, but you should see underneath it a message that says “Save $100 at checkout,” and the price will fall once you place the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VeiJ14"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
