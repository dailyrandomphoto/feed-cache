    <title>GoPro says the chip shortage won’t affect holiday sales</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z9B6sv"&gt;GoPro &lt;a href="https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/GoPro-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the global chip and other supply chain shortages won’t affect its holiday sales this year, meaning the action camera company is poised to finish one of its best years in recent memory in strong fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5jhL8"&gt;“Despite supply chain constraints that are affecting many industries, we have successfully partnered with our suppliers to produce inventory to support our fourth-quarter revenue expectations,” CEO Nick Woodman said while &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001500435/000150043521000065/gpro2021-09x30exh992xer.htm"&gt;discussing the company’s third-quarter financial results on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. “GoPro.com and our retail partners will be stocked and ready for shoppers this holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLfdGb"&gt;That’s especially good news for GoPro’s bottom line because the new Hero10 Black is selling incredibly well despite the higher $499 price tag. GoPro said Thursday that 98 percent of the roughly 800,000 cameras it sold in the third quarter were at or above the $300 price tag — up from 83 percent in the third quarter of 2020. The average sale price for cameras in the quarter was $381, up 25 percent year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zZyJIM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The GoPro Hero10: small step for the Hero10, big leap for GoPro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bD4oaZ"&gt;GoPro has also been increasingly shifting to a direct-sales model over the last few years — nearly a third of its revenue this past quarter came from sales on GoPro.com — which means it’s making more on every camera sold. The company said Thursday that it booked $14 million in revenue this past quarter for its subscription service, too, which now has over 1.34 million customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfoyaW"&gt;All that adds up to the company’s best third quarter since 2017. GoPro booked $317 million in revenue and about $49 million in profit. (The company reported a quarterly profit of $312 million, though $263 million of that was attributed to a wonky deferred tax situation.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkoOha"&gt;GoPro’s best quarter every year, though, is the final one. The holiday season has always been kind to the camera company, even in its darkest years. With the Hero 10 Black already doing well and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20954058/gopro-q3-earnings-hero-8-black-sales-figures-revenue"&gt;memories of layoffs and failed products getting fuzzier&lt;/a&gt;, it could turn out to be one of the company’s biggest quarters since its blockbuster holiday season in 2014 — which was when it broke into the mainstream with the Hero4 cameras. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly will start phasing out mask requirements for US retail store customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask is seen outside an Apple retail store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-grsg9Sg0X49OeTVZzFNyDnb4QQ=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095412/1232558252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple is reportedly going to lift mask requirements for customers at some of its retail stores in the US. | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0ozwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly planning to begin ending mask requirements for customers at some of its US retail stores as early as Friday (via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;). The company told employees about the change in an internal memo on Thursday,&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported, saying the decision was based on a decline in coronavirus cases and a rise in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVxdeW"&gt;Like many companies with multiple locations, Apple has changed its masking requirements for customers more than once since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic last year. In March 2020, the company closed most of its retail stores &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;as the virus spread&lt;/a&gt;. It began reopening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/17/21261921/apple-stores-reopening-plans-us-locations"&gt;some US stores in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with many offering only curbside service and not allowing customers inside. Most stores that did open to customers conducted temperature checks and required customers and employees to wear masks. Apple began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopening all its US retail stores in March 2021&lt;/a&gt; as vaccines became more widely available and eased mask requirements for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/apple-s-u-s-stores-offices-to-start-dropping-mask-requirement"&gt;customers in June&lt;/a&gt; as vaccination rates began to rise, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598686/apple-retail-stores-mask-mandate-requirement"&gt;reinstate them in July&lt;/a&gt; as COVID-19 cases surged once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESRxKQ"&gt;The latest memo states that the updated mask policy will apply to retail customers at more than 100 of Apple’s 270 US stores and will be the same for vaccinated and unvaccinated customers. Mask requirements for Apple retail employees will remain in place, however, and will continue for customers in areas where local governments still require indoor masking. The company added that it will “continue to monitor local guidance and Covid data” throughout the coming holiday season and adjust as conditions warrant, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAiyqz"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oog2t8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on an Android phone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5oizS_GANTpgtYInVRbIaqiy_-0=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095406/Screenshot_20211104_150854.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFc8fJ"&gt;Sometimes there’s no way around it — you’ve got to use an app. If you need to sign a PDF document from your Android phone, that’s simply how you’ve got to go — unlike iOS, which lets you create a signature using its built-in Markup app, you need to find a third-party source. There are a variety of apps available, but the most well-known is the free version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fTfgT"&gt;So if you want to be able to sign off on contracts and other PDF documents without having to grab your computer, here’s how to use the Android version of Acrobat to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6iryGy"&gt;Download and install Adobe Acrobat Reader from the Play Store. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bsdKWZ"&gt;Sign in (or create an account); if you’ve just installed the app, you may have to go through a number of popups offering directions and advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gyD2IX"&gt;Tap the “Files” icon at the bottom of the screen. It will give you access not only to files saved on your device (you will have to allow access to all files first) but to those saved on Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Adobe’s Document Cloud. You can also search for PDFs that are attached to Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On Acrobat’s main screen, select File on the bottom menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWtapISEWocTJYCTl3526mzFdhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986242/Screenshot_20211104_130819.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Acrobat’s main screen, select File on the bottom menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can download a PDF from a variety of sources." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQ8Q6Pun7TFxKpyA_S9eo2FtDCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986245/Screenshot_20211104_100806.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can download a PDF from a variety of sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UqHsDi"&gt;I chose Google Drive. I was invited to access Google Drive and PDFs from Gmail using the same email account; I also had to give the app access to your Google account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tO75ZI"&gt;However you decide to go, choose your source and tap on your PDF file to bring it up in Acrobat. Then tap on the “Edit” icon in the lower right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve got your PDF, select the edit icon in the corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/981TTRy24sKm49S3jGy-gviV2Pc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986248/Screenshot_20211104_113011.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve got your PDF, select the edit icon in the corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Fill &amp;amp;amp; Sign.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LXBxhx2YZLYdj_kwxSyidIH3ePI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986252/Screenshot_20211104_113317.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Fill &amp;amp; Sign.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ci4TM1"&gt;Select “Fill &amp;amp; Sign.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q9befJ"&gt;Tap on the signature icon in the lower right corner (it looks like a pen nib) and select “Create Signature” (or “Create Initials” if that’s all you need).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the pen icon in the lower right corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GWI4ZekwKSkjeDOwYcYaBiBUDHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986256/Screenshot_20211104_113437.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the pen icon in the lower right corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can create a signature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kMBih2FOWKeDssvSINbluOcGWoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986261/Screenshot_20211104_113536.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can create a signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="PlPxjM"&gt;You’ll get a “Sign Here” box in landscape mode with the options (above the box) to draw your signature, insert an image, or use your camera to photograph a signature drawn on paper. When you’re ready, tap on “Done” in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can draw your signature on the screen, use an existing image, or take a photo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34F6-C2tGppDjCwsjnTMXKuvNP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986262/Screenshot_20211104_113844.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can draw your signature on the screen, use an existing image, or take a photo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9kS0Gr"&gt;You’ll be returned to your PDF document. Tap on the area where you want your signature placed. It will appear in a box; you can pull on the sides of the box to make your signature larger or smaller, or tap on the trash icon (that will also appear) to get rid of it. When you’re done, select the checkmark in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MBJj4G"&gt;And you’re done! In the future, when you go into “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” and select the signature icon, the signature you just created will be there to drop into your document. If you want to try again, you can tap the “minus” sign to the right of the signature to delete it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now just place and size your signature." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6ChOlLtmf4wzcZ316rJHPTn2kg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986264/Screenshot_20211104_114008.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now just place and size your signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The next time you select the pen icon, your signature will be ready." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O8tldJoTRg0RHz_JAr2Ru4HWpz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986266/Screenshot_20211104_114238.png"&gt;

    <title>DoorDash adds in-app safety features, but couriers need more protection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4F3p49bvl3pryWo11psiaJeWts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095275/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wMt3Ur"&gt;DoorDash is &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/11/03/doordash-launches-safedash/"&gt;adding a set of tools for its delivery workers called “SafeDash,”&lt;/a&gt; which includes a way to contact an agent from the ADT security company or to call 911 through ADT. The company is first launching the tool in major cities like Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, but says it’ll roll out to all its US couriers by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYPydm"&gt;While it’s good that DoorDash is acknowledging the dangers its delivery workers face, some advocates say that SafeDash won’t help solve the problems of thieves targeting them for their money or bikes, and the apps giving them routes that put them in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UXgXK"&gt;According to DoorDash, SafeDash will give delivery workers a button that will have an ADT agent call them if they feel unsafe. That ADT agent will also be able to contact the authorities if the driver is unresponsive, or if something obviously goes wrong. Delivery workers will also be able to skip the call in an emergency situation and have ADT contact 911 for them. The security company will be able to give the Dasher’s GPS location to the police and will communicate with the delivery worker through text so they can relay information to authorities without having to actually talk out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZywcoDMSfXN3s25krWkCm-W3NM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986431/SOS2__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: DoorDash&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can either connect with an ADT agent or have them contact 911 for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9ZJI2"&gt;Those who work for DoorDash and other services like it face a variety of dangers posed by inattentive drivers, poor infrastructure, the weather, and other people. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed the danger bike delivery workers in New York City can face when their route includes going over bridges or through tunnels where they’re often ambushed by people looking to steal the expensive e-bikes they need to stay competitive. Through it all, they’re expected to complete deliveries on time — otherwise, they worry they might be downgraded and get fewer gig offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Iytj6F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hzxfdl"&gt;One of DoorDash’s competitors, Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us"&gt;also has a panic button&lt;/a&gt; that works in a similar way for drivers, couriers, and riders. But some delivery workers, whose work puts them at risk of injury and robbery, feel like a technology-based solution isn’t going to fix the issue. “We don’t need an app to call 911,” Hildalyn Colón-Hernández from the Worker’s Justice Project told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, she says, workers need to be able to choose areas that they feel safe working, and not face penalties for prioritizing their safety over a completed delivery. While New York City &lt;a href="https://www.romanolaw.com/2021/09/30/special-delivery-new-yorks-new-protections-for-food-delivery-workers/"&gt;is working on legislation&lt;/a&gt; to codify those kinds of protections into law, protections will still be needed for workers in other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w324tY"&gt;Hernández says that by adding the SafeDash feature, DoorDash is signaling that it knows it has a responsibility to keep its workers safe, which it hasn’t necessarily done enough in the past. The dangers delivery workers face have been shown in reports by both advocacy organizations like &lt;a href="https://losdeliveristasunidos.org/ldu-report"&gt;the WJP and Los Deliveristas Unidos&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;media outlets like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but until recently they haven’t been faced head-on by companies, legislators, or &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/storm-ida-food-delivery-drivers-wade-through-waist-high-floods-2021-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;even customers&lt;/a&gt;. They’re still an everyday reality for delivery workers, though — Hernández says that 19 NYC Deliveristas have died on the job in the past 18 months alone, and there &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/doordash-adds-safety-features-protect-drivers-80949644"&gt;have been other incidents throughout the country&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSsCQp"&gt;While delivery apps may be beginning to acknowledge that they have a role to play in keeping their workers safe, society is still grappling with how gig workers should be treated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;California voters passed Proposition 22&lt;/a&gt; almost exactly a year ago, which made it legal for companies like DoorDash, Lyft, and Uber to classify their workers as contractors instead of employees (and therefore exempt them from benefits like company-provided health insurance). The law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635286/judge-rules-california-prop-22-gig-workers-law-unconstitutional"&gt;has since been ruled as unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends and Valorant are now available in the Epic Games Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKd1pGg-vSimAYNHbw7Bv1HDup4=/54x0:1217x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095071/FDXPMHBUYAITXEz.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Riot games are now available on the Epic Games Store.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yY9yT"&gt;Riot Games’ &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt; are now available to download from the Epic Games Store, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/riot-games-brings-league-of-legends-valorant-and-more-to-epic-games-store"&gt;the two companies announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. They’re free to download and play, just like they are from Riot. When you get them from the Epic Games Store, your computer will install the Riot Client, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679479/riot-games-new-client-pc-launcher-library"&gt;Riot’s new unified launcher&lt;/a&gt;, which is where you can actually install and launch the individual games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yVeeO"&gt;This isn’t the first time Epic has offered a way to get another company’s launcher; you’ve been able to download the Itch.io launcher from the Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;since April&lt;/a&gt;. Epic’s willingness to include apps with other launchers is in line with CEO Tim Sweeney’s long-standing support for more open app distribution models. It’s something Sweeney directly emailed Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419618/tim-sweeney-email-tim-cook-wwdc-2015-ios-open-platform-antitrust"&gt;to advocate for on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic is also locked in legal battles with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687968/fortnite-ios-epic-apple-appeal-verdict-antitrust"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; after it added a direct payment system to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in violation of the two companies’ rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHpEaK"&gt;Adding Riot titles brings games in the hugely popular &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; franchise to the Epic Games Store, and they could see an added boost by being available on Epic’s platform. But I’m not kidding when I say the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; franchise is already huge: Riot shared this week that 180 million players played games set in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1455172784938651649"&gt;&lt;em&gt;just in October&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkNu50"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to our global community for helping Runeterra reach new heights! 180 million players in October and still growing! &lt;a href="https://t.co/7w9goYBeBM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7w9goYBeBM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Riot Games #RiotXArcane   (@riotgames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1455172784938651649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v3PaG0"&gt;That number isn’t exactly what it seems, as Riot is including the mobile hit &lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift &lt;/em&gt;and counting a single person who plays two of its games as two separate players, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/with-180-million-players-league-of-legends-games-have-more-active-users-than-steam/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still a gigantic number of players, though, and Riot is making a big push to grow that number even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S339Ah"&gt;Epic and Riot teamed up on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22760266/league-of-legends-jinx-fortnite-netflix-arcane"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin for the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; character Jinx&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available from the game’s item shop on Thursday. And the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin and the Riot titles on the Epic Games Store arrive ahead of &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; TV show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688837/netflix-arcane-league-of-legends-trailer-show-riot-games-release-date"&gt;premiering November 6th on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surprise! Facebook’s climate denial problem got worse this year </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activists bring iceberg to have it melt in front of the US Capitol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Thlg23qr0q6Q33EX0BNAZa70vEw=/0x0:6699x4466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094955/1236343298.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3ZvcR"&gt;As world leaders scramble to forge global agreements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; this month in a last-ditch effort to avert the worst of the climate crisis, there’s a threat to meaningful climate action lurking on social media. Climate denial on Facebook has gotten even worse this year, according to a new &lt;a href="https://stopfundingheat.info/facebook-in-denial/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by climate advocacy group Stop Funding Heat and the Real Facebook Oversight Board, a watchdog group made up of academics, journalists, and activists. It’s evidence that Facebook’s efforts to stomp out lies about climate change are failing, the study’s authors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJd5V2"&gt;Reactions, comments, and shares per post from Facebook pages and groups dedicated to spreading climate misinformation jumped a whopping 77 percent since January, the report found. Each day, it found, climate misinformation on the platform gets between 818,000 and 1.36 million views. Less than 4 percent of the posts it analyzed had been fact-checked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5xRVYJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook is the Big Tobacco of our generation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ykr2F"&gt;“Facebook is the Big Tobacco of our generation, greenwashing to avoid responsibility and sewing [sic] confusion and doubt about climate change in the global conversation,” Real Facebook Oversight Board wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNcd3p"&gt;The authors analyzed a dataset of 195 pages and groups and 48,700 posts written in English between January and August. That included 41 accounts focused entirely on climate misinformation, like a page called ‘Friends of Science’ that today posted a photo of a cake with icing that says “COP26 Much Ado About Nothing”— a reference to COP26 the high-profile United Nations climate summit taking place in Glasgow. Other pages and groups also have a history of posting false information about climate change. Fox News, Breitbart, and Sean Hannity were the three most prolific spreaders of climate misinformation identified in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv5ERZ"&gt;The study also scrutinized advertising on the platform and found 113 instances of Facebook making money from ads pushing climate misinformation. More than three-quarters of the spending came from just seven pages, all of which had previously been flagged in an &lt;a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-86222daed29c6f49ab2da76b0df15f76#"&gt;October 2020 investigation&lt;/a&gt; of disinformation ads on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxo1At"&gt;“Facebook has been told over and over, through public reports and in private meetings, that its platform is a breeding ground for climate misinformation. Either they don’t care or they don’t know how to fix it,” Sean Buchan, chief researcher for Stop Funding Heat, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kam0a6"&gt;Facing pressure from activists, Facebook launched a “Climate Science Center” last year that shares information, videos, and quizzes about climate change and is now available in more than 100 countries. But environmental activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677376/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-fossil-fuel-advertising"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; it’s a paltry effort that doesn’t stop the spread of climate lies in the first place. Facebook says that its Science Center gets more than 100,000 visits daily, far less than the number of views garnered by misleading climate posts analyzed in the new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FsPciO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Either they don’t care or they don’t know how to fix it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhovRL"&gt;The company, which recently rebranded itself as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;, has faced even more heat recently with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;massive document leak&lt;/a&gt; that revealed failures to stop harmful content related to everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22754046/facebook-tighter-restrictions-vaccine-misinformation-children"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpNLjf"&gt;The study adds to a steady stream of damning findings on Facebook’s handling of misleading climate information. Earlier this week, a separate &lt;a href="https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; traced 69 percent of all interactions with content denying climate change back to just 10 publishers. In September, an &lt;a href="http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Texas_Disinfo_Report_final_v4.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; into misinformation around this year’s &lt;a href="https://windommedia.com/blog/2021/05/27/go-read-this-investigation-into-the-real-death-toll-from-the-texas-freeze-justine-calma/"&gt;deadly cold snap&lt;/a&gt; in Texas found that less than 1 percent of interactions with the “highest-performing” content that falsely blamed wind turbines for blackouts were with posts that carried Facebook’s fact-checking labels. And in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063436369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; published&lt;/a&gt; an investigation into a de facto loophole for opinion content in Facebook’s fact-checking practices that triggered an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368136/facebook-climate-change-fact-check-senators-warren"&gt;inquiry from Democratic senators&lt;/a&gt;. The company works with independent fact-checkers to review and rate how accurate content is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV8Alz"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the new report uses “flawed methodology” to inflate the number of posts and ads containing climate misinformation. “It’s really just posts these groups disagree with politically,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPYwlg"&gt;But while the report authors acknowledge that their definition of climate misinformation included content which has no overt factual inaccuracies but is misleadingly packaged, the report also flagged many outright lies. For example, the study found a quote from botanist and climate denier &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/david-bellamy-obituary"&gt;David Bellamy&lt;/a&gt; that says, “Global warming is part of a natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles.” The quote from 2008, “does not reflect scientific consensus” that &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/"&gt;humans are to blame&lt;/a&gt; for climate change, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/03/viral-image/2008-quote-does-not-reflect-scientific-consensus-h/"&gt;Politifact&lt;/a&gt;, one of the independent fact-checking groups with which Facebook partners. While some Facebook posts sharing the quote have been taken down or labeled as “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/198600623557681/posts/4541752425909124"&gt;false information&lt;/a&gt;,” the viral quote can still be found in other posts without the fact-checking label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yK5vTY"&gt;“Clearly Facebook’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program, and its Climate Science Center, has failed,” Buchan said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbp8AX"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji4qUe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSUhRk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Flex drivers will start getting checks for $60 million in withheld tips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ybo6r9uYe_amZGBtZv4UJA1MZy8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094541/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EeD01z"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission will send out more than $60 million to drivers for Amazon’s Flex program, representing tip money that the commission says was illegally withheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2rVe4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/11/ftc-returns-nearly-60-million-drivers-whose-tips-were-illegally"&gt;According to the official announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC is preparing 139,501 checks and 1,621 PayPal payments to drivers who had more than $5 in withheld tips. The highest back payout going to a single driver is more than $28,000, while the average repayment is $422. Nearly 20,000 drivers will receive checks for more than $600, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSmweo"&gt;Drivers are expected to receive their tips before January 7th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2cn6OU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The highest back payout going to a single driver is more than $28,000”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WHn8N1"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;the FTC sued Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for withholding tips in its Flex program between the years 2016 and 2019. Amazon continued to collect portions of the drivers’ tips up until the government filed its lawsuit outlining the alleged illegal behavior in 2019, according to the FTC’s investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABkrRY"&gt;“Rather than passing along 100 percent of customers’ tips to drivers, as it had promised to do, Amazon used the money itself,” said Daniel Kaufman, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqIVrq"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-somehttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-some"&gt;Amazon agreed to settle the case&lt;/a&gt; and surrender all of the tip money, totaling more than $60 million, to the FTC. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raka46"&gt;Amazon Flex contracts with individual drivers to deliver packages in their own vehicles, primarily delivering Prime Now and Amazon Fresh goods. In its February lawsuit, the FTC said that customers and drivers were told by Amazon that the drivers would receive 100 percent of any tips paid. This practice ended in 2016 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;Amazon allegedly lowered the minimum hourly pay&lt;/a&gt; for drivers and made up the difference with their tip money. The FTC said drivers were not notified of this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQgolv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0s8mE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twelve South’s new Apple Watch sweatband doesn’t work with every watch</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve South’s new ActionBand for Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twelve South&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZRMxW"&gt;One of the defining features of the Apple Watch is the vast number of bands you can buy to make it fit your needs and style. That can be particularly useful for workouts. You might not want to wear a leather band during a long run, but you can easily swap in bands made of other materials that can better withstand sweat. If you’ve been looking for a full-on wrist sweatband to use alongside your Apple Watch, though, accessories maker Twelve South now has you covered with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ActionBand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PglZr"&gt;The ActionBand is a terry cotton band that sits tight on your wrist and has a frame for you to slot in the watch part of your Apple Watch. The frame is designed in such a way to let you access the Digital Crown and the watch’s side button, so you won’t have to rely entirely on the touchscreen if you need to navigate around your watch while working out. To clean a pair of the sweatbands (when you buy the ActionBand, you get one with an Apple Watch cradle and one without), Twelve South says you can just toss them in the washing machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F0E9BK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQAEPFe7-FU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGnFJA"&gt;While the ActionBand does seem well-designed and comfortable, if you’re not already someone who uses sweatbands, I don’t know if it’s worth picking up. In my experience, Apple’s standard Sport Band is already quite comfortable for long workouts, so switching to a sweatband wouldn’t have a benefit for me there. I’d argue that the Sport Band is easier to clean than the ActionBand; just run it under some water. And if I used the ActionBand while doing yoga, I’d worry that the sweatbands could make poses where I have to grab my wrist more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lN3EIu"&gt;The ActionBand also has a big catch: unlike Apple’s own watch bands, the ActionBand isn’t compatible with every Apple Watch. Right now, only the Apple Watch Series 4, 5, 6, and SE can be slotted into the ActionBand, though Twelve South says Apple Watch Series 7 compatibility is “coming soon.” Unfortunately, the Apple Watch Series 3 isn’t compatible with the ActionBand at all, which presumably means older models with a largely similar design aren’t, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Nig36"&gt;If you are interested in the ActionBand, though, you can pick one up now for $30 from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Twelve South’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft warns Windows 11 features are failing due to its expired certificate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user types on the Surface Pro 8 from behind.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pZHyn0"&gt;Microsoft has started warning Windows 11 users that certain features in the operating system are failing to load due to an expired certificate. The certificate expired on October 31st, and Microsoft warns that some Windows 11 users aren’t able to open apps like the Snipping Tool, touch keyboard, or emoji panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imJv8p"&gt;A patch is available to fix some of the issues, but it’s currently in preview, meaning you have to install it manually from Windows Update. The patch, &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;KB4006746&lt;/a&gt;, will fix the touch keyboard, voice typing, emoji panel, and issues with the getting started and tips sections of Windows 11. You’ll be able to find this patch by checking for updates in the Windows Update section of Settings in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z84dE2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft still needs to fix the Snipping Tool&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u40ii1"&gt;Microsoft’s patch doesn’t address the problems with the Snipping Tool app, though. “To mitigate the issue with Snipping Tool, use the Print Screen key on your keyboard and paste the screenshot into your document,” &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-21h2#2739msgdesc"&gt;recommends Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. “You can also paste it into Paint to select and copy the section you want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFWsMW"&gt;It’s not clear how many Windows 11 users are affected by these issues, and we haven’t been able to replicate the Snipping Tool problems on multiple patched systems. If you are having issues, some &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers have reported being able to change the system date back to October 30th, and then launching Snipping Tool to get it working again. You can then change the system date back once the app has loaded ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJrSqy"&gt;The expired certificate is also causing issues with the accounts page in the settings section of Windows 11 with S mode enabled and the input method editor UI. It’s not clear when the Snipping Tool and S mode issues will be addressed. “We are working on a resolution for Snipping tool and the S mode only issues and will provide an update when more information is available,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siGlD0"&gt;Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 issues come just two weeks after the company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22732336/microsoft-windows-11-amd-cpu-performance-issues-fix-release"&gt;issue a patch to fix AMD CPU performance in the OS&lt;/a&gt;. A bug was slowing performance on Ryzen processors by up to 15 percent in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnlZ40"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, November 4th 1:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Snipping Tool workaround.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet is launching a company that uses AI for drug discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fvTWcIK-44RTqVs2-txzT6ervE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094150/msingleton_180612_2663_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X7ReMi"&gt;A new Alphabet company will use artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery, Google’s parent company &lt;a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/blog"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll build off of the work done by DeepMind, another Alphabet subsidiary that has done groundbreaking work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586578/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-human-proteome-released-for-free"&gt;using AI to predict the structure of proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81Rhb0"&gt;The new company, called Isomorphic Laboratories, will leverage that success to build tools that can help identify new pharmaceuticals. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis will also serve as the CEO for Isomorphic, but the two companies will stay separate and collaborate occasionally, a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mS2A8"&gt;For years, experts have pointed to AI as a way to make it faster and cheaper to find new medications to treat various conditions. AI could help scan through databases of potential molecules to find some that best fit a particular biological target, for example, or to fine-tune proposed compounds. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in companies building AI tools over &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-021-00045-7"&gt;the past two years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6obUf"&gt;Isomorphic will try to build models that can predict how drugs will interact with the body, Hassabis &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/11/04/alphabet-launches-drug-discovery-company-building-on-deepmind/?utm_content=buffer1a72c&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter_organic"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It could leverage DeepMind’s work on protein structure to figure out how multiple proteins might interact with each other. The company may not develop its own drugs but instead sell its models. It will focus on developing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, a spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIvcw"&gt;Developing and testing drugs, though, could be a steeper challenge than figuring out protein structure. For example, even if two proteins have structures that fit together physically, it’s hard to tell &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-021-00161-0"&gt;how well they’ll actually stick&lt;/a&gt;. A drug candidate that looks promising based on how it works at a chemical level also &lt;a href="https://www.icr.ac.uk/blogs/the-drug-discoverer/page-details/reflecting-on-deepmind-s-alphafold-artificial-intelligence-success-what-s-the-real-significance-for-protein-folding-research-and-drug-discovery"&gt;might not always work&lt;/a&gt; when it’s given to an animal or a person. Over 90 percent of drugs that make it to a clinical trial end up not working, as chemist and writer Derek Lowe &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/more-protein-folding-progress---what-s-it-mean"&gt;pointed out in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;this summer&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the problems aren’t because there was something wrong at the molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43Kgc7"&gt;The work done at DeepMind and the proposed work at Isomorphic could help bust through some research bottlenecks but aren’t a quick fix for the the countless challenges of drug development. “The laborious, resource-draining work of doing the biochemistry and biological evaluation of, for example, drug functions” will remain, as Helen Walden, a professor of structural biology at the University of Glasgow, previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586578/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-human-proteome-released-for-free"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
