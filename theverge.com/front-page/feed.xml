    <title>Here’s when and how you can preorder the Playdate handheld</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZQoyjn"&gt;Playdate, the quirky new handheld with a black-and-white screen and a crank on its side created by Panic and co-designed with Teenage Engineering, will be available for preorder starting Thursday, July 29th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. &lt;a href="https://play.date/"&gt;You’ll be able to secure a unit through the site play.date&lt;/a&gt; for $179. It’ll start shipping later this year &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/shipping/"&gt;in select countries&lt;/a&gt;, though the company still doesn’t have a concrete release date for the portable device. You can also preorder the Playdate Cover accessory that can protect the device for $29. If you preorder, you’ll be charged immediately, but Panic says you can cancel at any time for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcP20e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523929/playdate-preorder-game-lineup-dock-announced"&gt;Panic co-founder Cabel Sasser shared last month&lt;/a&gt; in a video update that “the sooner you order, the sooner you’ll get one, but we’re not going to close the door on you.” So, even if you’re a bit late to ordering, at least you won’t have to panic to get Panic’s Playdate. According to Panic, the first 20,000 or so units will ship toward the end of 2021, and orders after that will ship in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAa2Bq"&gt;In case you’re not familiar with this irresistibly cute handheld, it was announced in May 2019, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351213"&gt;we just put up some in-depth impressions of the console and a few of its games&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll get new, exclusive games in waves called “seasons,” sort of like a TV show. For the first season, you’ll get two games every two weeks over a 12-week period. Panic is being cagey about game details (it hasn’t announced three of the 24 total games), but you can find some thumbnails below to somewhat get a sense of what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The common cold was rare during 2020 — but it’s having a resurgence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Hygiene" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpcbx-hDYh3-uTI47RR73agdu-U=/0x107:6863x4682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618074/1203952288.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dp5MiR"&gt;Levels of influenza and other non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses were at historic lows during most of 2020, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029a1.htm?s_cid=mm7029a1_w"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There’s still very little flu circulating, but other viruses — including parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses, which cause colds — are having an out-of-season resurgence in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggPiSY"&gt;Between October 2020 and May 2021, levels of the flu in the United States were at their lowest since 1997, the first year there’s flu season data available, the analysis found. There was very little flu reported &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-worldwide-during-the-covid-pandemic1/"&gt;all over the world&lt;/a&gt;, and experts think the protective measures people took against COVID-19 — masking, distancing — suppressed the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrVpVS"&gt;The nearly nonexistent flu season this year might mean that this fall and winter’s flu season could be more severe, the CDC report warned. Because there wasn’t much influenza around, people may not have been exposed to the virus at the same rates they usually are. That could blunt the normal levels of immunity to the virus. “Lower levels of population immunity, especially among younger children, could portend more widespread disease and a potentially more severe epidemic when influenza virus circulation resumes,” the authors of the report wrote. That means it’ll be especially important for doctors and nurses to encourage anyone older than six months to get their flu shots this fall, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVuWthy1mmfiNW2224tgavXi66k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732927/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_9.29.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an out-of-season uptick in parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4subxw"&gt;The circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a virus that causes colds in adults but can be dangerous for infants, was also muted during 2020 and early 2021. Rates started to tick back up in April 2021, which is unusual — normally, levels of that virus peak in January. Parainfluenza viruses and common human coronaviruses followed a similar trend: levels were low through 2020 and then started to climb in February 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4gMNm"&gt;The public health measures used to slow the spread of COVID-19 likely helped suppress these viruses over 2020, and they bounced back as communities in the US started to lift some of those restrictions. It’s still not clear exactly how the flu and various cold-causing viruses respond to different strategies used against COVID-19, so the trends in these viruses might be unpredictable over the next year as efforts to fight the pandemic continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSBpUg"&gt;“Clinicians should be aware that respiratory viruses might not exhibit typical seasonal circulation patterns and that a resumption of circulation of certain respiratory viruses is occurring,” the CDC report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IF7M23"&gt;The uptick in viruses that cause the common cold might also make it harder for people and their doctors to differentiate between COVID-19 symptoms and symptoms of other illnesses. During 2020, any cold- or flu-like symptoms were likely to be COVID-19 — it was one of the only viruses around. Now that other viruses are on their way back, the picture could be murkier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiobc5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzbdOo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Playdate hands-on: a Game Boy from a different dimension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Playdate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1qXWsYoBJElN0iT8lzJjsrzoyY=/0x95:4000x2762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69618057/Playdate_model_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few days with Panic’s crank-powered handheld&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i14rpl"&gt;If things go as expected, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578902/video-game-handhelds-steam-deck-switch-playdate-analogue-pocket"&gt;four new dedicated video game handhelds will launch this year&lt;/a&gt;. And each is primed to offer something different. The next Switch has a brighter, more vibrant OLED screen; Valve’s Steam Deck is a gaming PC in your hands; and Analogue’s Pocket handheld recreates the original Game Boy hardware while adding modern upgrades like a better LCD display and the option to connect to an HDTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14HmIj"&gt;And then there’s the Playdate from Panic. Whereas the aforementioned handhelds are almost uniformly technological upgrades, the Playdate offers something much weirder. It looks kind of like a Game Boy that comes from an alien world. There are familiar elements, like a D-pad and face buttons, but many of its games are controlled by a crank that slots into the side. And those games are only available in black and white, and they’ll eventually be released as part of weekly mystery drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9gY9h"&gt;It sounds strange and fascinating, and I had the chance to head into the PlayDate’s parallel universe over the last few days with a near-final version of the device. It definitely &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; weird — but that’s also what makes it exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqfqrc"&gt;The most striking thing about the Playdate is its electric yellow color scheme. It stands out in a world of smartphones that are mostly black slabs. It’s also a square, measuring at 76 x 74mm, as opposed to the more common rectangle, and it’s only 9mm thick. Basically, it’s tiny. About half the front is taken up by a glossy 400 × 240 display, with a shiny D-pad and A and B buttons below, much like on an original Game Boy. There’s also a home / menu button on the top right corner, a lock button on the right shoulder, and a headphone jack and USB-C port on the bottom. A tiny, yet surprisingly loud, speaker runs down the right side of the display. So far, nothing too strange, until you see the silver crank jutting out the side. The PlayDate’s crank is about an inch long, and when not in use its handle slots nicely into the side of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBrwOmvXZ1ULdkGA6m4euMx6haU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731082/Saturday_Edition.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Edition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hdHNA"&gt;The company says that the version I played with is the final hardware (the software is still being tweaked) and it’s a great device to hold. The body of the Playdate has a nice matte texture that’s both comfortable and doesn’t smudge, while the buttons — and particularly the D-pad — are satisfyingly clicky. If you have big hands it might be a little cramped, as the pad and buttons are very close together, but I found it comfortable enough for long sessions. Most importantly, it’s fun and playful. This is clearly a device meant for playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlZnzQ"&gt;The display is similarly, uh, distinct. It’s crisp, yet is entirely black and white and has no backlight. It’s kind of like playing games on a high-end Kindle. It’s not reflective, as opposed to, say, a Switch. I had no problems playing games outside in the sun, even with games where the graphics were dark. In a nice touch, when the handheld goes to sleep, its display turns to a simple analog clock. No backlight is a bummer, but it at least means the Playdate has great battery life; Panic promises eight hours of continuous gameplay, and that proved about right during my short time with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PNPFdr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The games were all drastically different from each other&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2wDHG"&gt;My preview unit had four games included, and they were all drastically different from each other. Probably the most notable is &lt;em&gt;Crankin Presents: Time Travel Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Katamari&lt;/em&gt; creator Keita Takahashi. It’s essentially a platform game about a guy who is constantly late for a date. In order to get there on time, he has to avoid floating butterflies, literal hurdles, and charging pigs. The twist is that you don’t control the titular Crankin directly. Instead, you move him back and forth through time. The game is controlled entirely with the crank, which you can use to either fast forward or rewind his actions, which are independent of the obstacles. So if a butterfly floats by, for instance, you’ll want to fast-forward Crankin to a point where he’s bent over smelling a flower, so the bug passes by safely. It took me a little while to figure out what to do, but once I grasped the concept the game became a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4uOWU"&gt;Elsewhere is &lt;em&gt;Lost Your Marbles&lt;/em&gt;, a mashup of a visual novel and a puzzle game. In it you follow a young girl named Prota who works at some kind of scientific facility that’s researching memory. I won’t pretend to understand it, but for some reason Prota is able to access certain memories by playing a classic ball-in-maze puzzle. It’s weird, but the crank is well-suited for it, as you rotate it to move the maze around the ball in search of a memory. &lt;em&gt;Lost Your Marbles&lt;/em&gt; also looks great, with big, bold character portraits that make the most out of the hardware’s limited capabilities, buoyed by some really silly and hilarious writing. It’s a fun, quirky remix of genres that feels right at home on the Playdate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmS82gNmuHgotyH3tWlRoTIn8i0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731085/Lost_Your_Marbles.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost Your Marbles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdBpSm"&gt;The most surprising game I played was &lt;em&gt;Saturday Edition&lt;/em&gt;. It was surprising because of how straightforward it is. It’s a classic point-and-click style adventure and it doesn’t utilize the crank at all (at least from what I played); instead, you use the D-pad and buttons to wander around a city, collecting clues and solving puzzles. It’s been stripped down just enough so that it feels comfortable to play with only two buttons, and the grainy visuals make it feel like a long-lost PC game. If nothing else, &lt;em&gt;Saturday Edition &lt;/em&gt;is a good indication that the Playdate will be home to more than just silly crank-controlled games. It works well enough for more traditional titles as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQIzCm"&gt;Rounding out the quartet is &lt;em&gt;Whitewater Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;, an arcade-style surfing game that I can’t say much about because I could not figure out the controls. From what I can tell, you’re supposed to use the crank to spin the board and ride a wave, but no matter how much I tried I couldn’t stay afloat for more than a few seconds at a time. It’s entirely possible this is a “me” problem, but it does show that the unique nature of the crank controls could lead to some steeper than usual learning curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJANC2"&gt;The one thing I wasn’t able to experience with my Playdate is actually one of the most important aspects of the device: surprise. When the handheld finally launches, new games will be released in “seasons.” Essentially, over the course of each season a new mystery game will appear on your Playdate once a week. The release will be the same for everyone, making for a kind of unique appointment viewing-style experience. The full breadth of what the Playdate has to offer will rely a lot on what these games are like, as well as the communal discovery process. But a few days with the handheld has made me excited for what mysteries are in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ekQhNz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22351234"&gt;Preorders for the Playdate open on July 29th&lt;/a&gt;, with the first batch of units expected to start shipping “towards the end of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now use Edge’s password manager to log in to mobile apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2-QbkbHLtEFf4kORiKbqOrvSuc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617967/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c0zO8a"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/07/22/our-top-new-features-to-help-you-save-time-and-money-and-stay-safer-online-as-you-get-ready-for-back-to-school/"&gt;updating Edge on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to allow the browser’s password manager to log you in to your mobile apps. The new release, technically Edge 92, also includes new password safety features through a password health dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG3usG"&gt;The Edge mobile app should be able to use the browser’s password manager in a way that sounds similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;to other services like BitWarden or 1Password&lt;/a&gt;. Using your login credentials you’ve accumulated in Edge, you can easily log in to apps like Pinterest or Instagram, presumably with the autofill-type experience you’re used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="309G1p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Edge has a lot more password features now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fljMV3"&gt;Microsoft already offered a universal password management feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"&gt;in Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed you to set it as a default autofill option in iOS or Android. It’s not clear if Edge will work in the same way, but we’ve reached out to Microsoft to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YT-AM7tVLpIL-Tmm2cNxdQb8abk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733471/WIN_Edge_Password_Strength_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edge’s new password health dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3fUmK2"&gt;According to Microsoft, Edge can now also tell you if a password has been used on multiple sites and whether a new password is “strong” through a password health dashboard. Both features feel like table stakes things that should have been used across Edge already, but it’s great that they’re here now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lJ7JsLLr4yz6WLfDIg0VRZVT9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733476/WIN_Edge_Outlook_Extension_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edge’s Outlook extension packs all the email and calendar you could want in a tiny drop down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAZ4yf"&gt;For Outlook users, Microsoft now also offers &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/microsoft-outlook/kkpalkknhlklpbflpcpkepmmbnmfailf?hl=en-US&amp;amp;form=MO12IJ&amp;amp;OCID=MO12IJhttps%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoftedge.microsoft.com%2Faddons%2Fdetail%2Foutlook-as-edgechrome-ex%2Fkkpalkknhlklpbflpcpkepmmbnmfailf%3Fhl%3Den-US&amp;amp;form=MO12IJ&amp;amp;OCID=MO12IJ"&gt;an Outlook extension for Edge&lt;/a&gt; that lets you check your calendar and contacts and send email, all without opening a new tab or the Outlook app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMjjdT"&gt;You can download the new version of Edge now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnCLle"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGDxGK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Banks, brokerages, PSN, the Steam Store, and more are down in massive internet outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Development of the police software VeRA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrC9o22AmhvhBOKzaNjc9Q595FU=/0x0:5334x3556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617873/1233144145.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5cq91"&gt;Many websites — including banking pages, brokerages, and gaming services — have been affected by what looks to be a major internet outage. As website owners and companies that run services that provide the backbone of the web scramble to solve the issue, consumers have been left unable to access services like Ally Bank, Fidelity, Sony’s PlayStation Network, Airbnb, and more. Several airline sites are also having issues: Delta, British Airways, and Southwest’s sites are all having major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHK7wX"&gt;At the moment, it’s unclear what’s causing the outage, but Akamai, a content delivery network that hosts much of the internet, has confirmed to The Verge that it’s experiencing an outage and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Akamai/status/1418251400660889603"&gt;says that a fix is already rolling out&lt;/a&gt;. Both the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MTA/status/1418248990823534592"&gt;New York Metro Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1418249256519929856"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have tweeted that their service outages are due to Akamai. Cloudflare’s CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1418242657134944258"&gt;has chimed in&lt;/a&gt; to say that its service isn’t to blame. We’ve reached out to Oracle as well; its Oracle Cloud has also been mentioned as &lt;a href="https://ocistatus.oraclecloud.com"&gt;potentially having an issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Xx2P80"&gt;Gaming services have also been hit hard. &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/"&gt;DownDetector reports&lt;/a&gt; a spike of over 40,000 users who are having issues with the PlayStation Network, and the Steam store is also not currently functioning. DownDetector also reports issues with games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://status.playstation.com/"&gt;Sony’s PSN status page&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged an issue shortly before we published this post: “PlayStation Network services are up and running, but there are external, internet-wide issues that might affect your experience,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://livemap.pingdom.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pingdom’s live map&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; shows that the issue is global.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8V9JD0"&gt;As far as more essential services, a number of banks’ websites appear to be nonfunctional, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABC13News/status/1418218123535142925"&gt;there are reports&lt;/a&gt; of 911 systems being down across multiple states. It is, however, unclear if the emergency services outage is related to the other web outages — the Sheriff’s Department of Grayson County, Virginia, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/GraysonCountySheriffsOffice/posts/"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; its 911 outage stems from a fiber cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsrUTO"&gt;Outages like this show that, while the web is decentralized in theory, many major sites’ functionality is dependent on a handful of companies. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525820/fastly-outage-bug-customer"&gt;a single customer&lt;/a&gt; hit a bug that brought down Fastly’s CDN service — and Reddit, Twitch, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523953/twitch-reddit-down-fastly-outage-issues"&gt;went down with it.&lt;/a&gt; Problem’s with Amazon’s Web Services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;have also caused major outages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mE6RJ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic files new complaint in its antitrust suit against Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9zeJIDhl1hyW7gimA-xoGMJGPbE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617851/acastro_210429_1777_epic_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iEit1g"&gt;Epic has renewed its fight against mobile platforms’ app store restrictions, filing an update to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;antitrust case against Google&lt;/a&gt;. The filing adds mostly redacted details about Google’s alleged monopolistic behavior on Android, including banning Epic’s game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the Google Play Store last year. The amended complaint comes soon after a judge officially linked the case with a recent multi-state lawsuit, which took aim at Google’s Play Store policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ngV8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.156.0.pdf"&gt;Epic’s complaint&lt;/a&gt; builds on information gleaned from government antitrust probes and documents produced since the original suit. One addition, for instance, includes details revealed last year about “the close relationship that Google maintains with Apple,” including an agreement to pay &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/22/926290942/google-paid-apple-billions-to-dominate-search-on-iphones-justice-department-says"&gt;between $8 and $12 billion&lt;/a&gt; to be Apple’s default search provider. It also includes new information about Google’s supposed anti-competitive conduct, including its deals with phone makers and alternate app stores. Most of this information, however, has been sealed — leaving only hints about the claims that the case could hinge on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rD3oNZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The filing includes new details, but most are redacted&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fv7mC"&gt;Among the new redacted information, Epic apparently describes its plans to launch Epic on the Samsung Galaxy Store. “Google was determined not to let this happen,” the complaint says, so it offered Epic a “special deal” to launch on Google Play. When Epic rejected the deal, Google allegedly took other anti-competitive action, but the details of that action aren’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ddV8f"&gt;Google’s relationship with Samsung came under the microscope earlier this month when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;36 states and the District of Columbia sued Google&lt;/a&gt; for breaking antitrust law. The Epic complaint cites some allegations that were raised in that complaint, like a deal to turn the Samsung Galaxy Store into effectively a rebranded Play Store — something the new filing reveals was called “Project Agave.” Epic’s filing suggests that if the lawsuit proceeds, it will hinge partly on how Google responded to the prospect of an Epic-Samsung deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqn29F"&gt;Outside these and other redacted claims, the complaint makes the same basic argument as Epic’s &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.1.0.pdf"&gt;original lawsuit in August&lt;/a&gt;. It says Google’s “open” Android ecosystem is still functionally monopolistic, preventing other app stores or sideloaded apps from competing on a level playing field with Google’s official Play Store platform. It’s seeking the ability to place &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in the Google Play Store with an independent payment processing system and an end to other allegedly noncompetitive actions — which, in its complaint, include the relatively long and onerous process for launching a sideloaded app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eBA2Ga"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still awaiting a verdict in Epic v. Apple&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbUmyO"&gt;Epic and Google were initially supposed to appear in a hearing about the future of the case today. But the parties agreed to push back the timeline while Epic filed an amended complaint. Judge James Donato &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.155.0.pdf"&gt;also agreed&lt;/a&gt; to consolidate early parts of the case with the state Play Store lawsuit. A &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364325/gov.uscourts.cand.364325.154.0.pdf"&gt;proposed schedule&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this month gives Google until August 20th to file a motion to dismiss, then sets a hearing on the case for October 14th. Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;previously disputed&lt;/a&gt; the legal complaints against the Play Store, saying Google’s platform “provides more openness and choice than others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQ66tU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Google&lt;/em&gt; has moved more slowly than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;Epic’s lawsuit against Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which went to trial in May and awaits a verdict. &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; revolved around slightly different questions since, unlike Apple, Google does allow third-party apps or stores. So unlike on iOS, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t locked out of Android while the case proceeds; you can still download it directly from  Epic’s site. But both suits claim the platforms’ rules for developers are unfair and anti-competitive — and in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Google&lt;/em&gt;, Epic has found common cause with government antitrust watchdogs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google opens up Android Auto’s beta testing program  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_nt_a7bpveVPQIWTsTs815dKwE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617563/akrales_190725_3567_0090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E2eXTW"&gt;Google is launching a new &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/10961485"&gt;beta tester program for Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;, giving users the chance to get early access to features if they’re prepared to put up with the potential instability of unfinished software. Android Auto has had a testing program, but attempting to sign up for it has shown a message warning that the program had reached its “maximum number of testers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kYgUT"&gt;“As a beta tester, you can help us build a better version of Android Auto. You can test how well new features work with your specific phone and vehicle in your part of the world,” Google says. “When you share your feedback, we’ll use it to help plan improvements for future releases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZLNvhJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can help us build a better version of Android Auto”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O4UluO"&gt;The announcement of the new beta program comes as Android Auto has just gone through one of its biggest expansions in years when it launched in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150166/android-auto-expands-countries-europe-africa-asia"&gt;dozens of new countries&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020. Its wireless connectivity feature also recently got a big boost with news that any Android 11 phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377399/google-android-auto-android-11-wireless-phone-support"&gt;would be able to connect wirelessly&lt;/a&gt; to compatible vehicles.   Considering these enhancements, it’s not surprising that Google needs more beta testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lkrP8"&gt;To sign up, Google says you can head over to the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.projection.gearhead/"&gt;opt-in page&lt;/a&gt;, where there’ll be an option to “Become a tester.” Once signed up, the beta version of Android Auto can be downloaded from the Play Store. If the bugginess gets too much, Google says the link to opt out is &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.projection.gearhead/join"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. Just remember to uninstall the beta app and re-download the stable version from the Play Store to leave the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Wear OS 3 plans mean Android users should wait to buy a smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IdLQw53urY4_0NY58lzPjBBf_Bs=/127x0:1450x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617560/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByVX0L"&gt;Google has finally given its new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;unified smartwatch platform&lt;/a&gt; a name — and it’s an obvious one: Wear OS 3. That little detail was part of what may be a more contentious set of information about which current Wear OS smartwatches will be updated, when those updates will come, and what those updates will entail. On all three of those fronts, it’s not very good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpESVb"&gt;Google says that Wear OS 3 updates will start rolling out to a limited set of smartwatches in the “second half of 2022.” That’s quite a long way away, especially since we’re expecting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;first Wear OS 3 watches to be announced&lt;/a&gt; next month at Samsung’s Unpacked event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew1vVq"&gt;Currently, the list of watches that could get the update “include Mobvoi’s TicWatch Pro 3 GPS, TicWatch Pro 3 Cellular/LTE, TicWatch E3 and follow on TicWatch devices, as well as Fossil Group’s new generation of devices launching later this year,” according to Google’s post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHqFY1"&gt;That leaves a lot of Wear OS watches out, including everything from Fossil and its associated brands. And that list also leaves all of Samsung’s Tizen-based watches out. They’re currently the best option for most Android users, but they now appear to officially have an expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpM8gN"&gt;There’s no other way to put this: for Android users, it’s not a good idea to buy a smartwatch right now. Everything that’s available today either won’t be updated or won’t receive an update until late 2022. It’s the clearest and most direct example of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect"&gt;Osborne effect&lt;/a&gt; in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yu7qvl"&gt;And to be even blunter, it may not be a good idea to buy watches that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on that list, as there are further complications with that update. Google says that “in some limited cases, the user experience may be impacted” but declined to elaborate further right now. That could mean a lot of things, but a common experience with any computer is new operating systems feeling slow on older hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSeJl8"&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson promised that Google would “provide more details in advance of the update so users can make an informed decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gj0eTA"&gt;Additionally, upgrading to Wear OS 3 will require a full factory reset, wiping any settings and data you might have on the watch. Most of that should be backed up to your phone regardless as Wear OS apps usually aren’t fully self-contained on the watch, but it’s still likely to be a hassle. And you likely won’t be able to just hit a restore button after the update to bring back your old watch settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2brmOO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Installing the update will require resetting the watch to factory state&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIa2fZ"&gt;Google at least recognizes that many watch owners will not want to go through all that hassle, so it is offering a way to decline the update but still receive security patches. The company promises to continue to support the current version of Wear OS with updates and will offer security updates for “two years from device launch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x84qui"&gt;The blog post is likely meant to get the bad news out of the way early so that the decks are cleared for Samsung’s Galaxy smartwatch announcements — not to mention rumors of a Google Pixel watch that may also be in the wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGdh1z"&gt;After so many years of languishing, the next version of Wear OS will have a lot to prove. Although it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;announced this past May at Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, we still don’t have a full picture of how it will actually work in real use. We know that it takes some elements from Samsung’s Tizen platform — like watchfaces — but that generally it’s more Wear OS than Tizen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pMZGz"&gt;What we have seen of Wear OS 3 so far is promising. Google says it will be faster than current smartwatches while also offering longer battery life. It should also offer a standalone Google Maps app, offline Spotify music, and integrated Fitbit activity tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jw5snE"&gt;All of which means that if you’re an Android user who wants a smartwatch, the best option you have right now is to simply wait until new Wear OS 3 watches are launched and reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Faraday Future just became a publicly traded company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqXlWWHC1ThRp38XLAA2Smp3FS8=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69617501/E66OtTIWYAAXyHC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nasdaq&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="23OMrb"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Faraday future is a publicly traded company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIyIrj"&gt;It’s okay, I’ll give you a moment. I’ve been reporting on Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18088438/faraday-future-electric-cars-ev-news-layoffs-bankruptcy"&gt;for four years&lt;/a&gt; and it has even stunned me a few times in recent weeks. But it’s true: today, the startup’s shares began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and a fresh $1 billion was dumped into its battered war chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvPK66"&gt;Electric vehicle companies are going public left and right thanks to the rise in popularity of special purpose acquisition companies (which you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;a great explanation of here&lt;/a&gt;). So are companies that supply some of the new technologies that make EVs possible, like lithium-ion battery manufacturers, as well as others in related industries, like autonomous vehicle startups and makers of lidar sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuCRge"&gt;But none of those companies flirted with oblivion as much Faraday Future. Guided by the whims of exuberant billionaire founder Jia Yueting, a man who self-exiled from China to escape a colossal amount of debt, Faraday Future walked right up to the brink over the last few years and somehow lived to tell the tale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="WcVoyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q23NpP"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;happened along the way. After it was founded in 2014, Faraday Future was mistaken as a secret front operation for Apple’s self-driving car project. It debuted a static concept car at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10713718/faraday-future-vpa-iphone-comparison"&gt;announcing its intentions to be as disruptive as the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; (after Jia compared Apple to Hitler — no, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/27/8298999/apple-hitler-china-letv-jia-yueting"&gt;really&lt;/a&gt;). It returned to the trade show the following year and debuted a &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;electric vehicle only to have &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/25921-faraday-future-ff91-robot-valet"&gt;all sorts&lt;/a&gt; of things &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA18oyyG-xg"&gt;go wrong&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/faraday-future-hit-with-1-8-million-lawsuit-over-ces-d-1791529037"&gt;stiffed the company that helped put on the event&lt;/a&gt;. It announced a $1 billion factory in the Nevada desert that never got built (after passing up existing options, including the factory in Illinois that Rivian now occupies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQKLck"&gt;Then the real trouble started. Jia’s profligate spending — he poured $900 million of his own money, much of it drawn from loans he never repaid in China, into Faraday Future by 2017 — had helped the startup amass a nearly 1,500-person workforce and design a ludicrously expensive technological marvel of an electric SUV. But he had trouble bringing on other investors. He balked at the idea of giving up any control over the company, and that scared off anyone with deep enough pockets to pony up the kind of capital required to build a factory and make a car at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uWzkdi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Inside Faraday Future's financial house of cards&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="osaj11"&gt;So in late 2017, Faraday Future was running ragged. It had just a few million dollars in its bank accounts. Fed up with Jia, executives that were hired away from Tesla and Apple and other big companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16633542/faraday-future-stefan-krause-resignation-bmw-trouble"&gt;started to flee&lt;/a&gt;. The chief financial officer who was brought in to save the company left late that year after Jia refused his proposal to restructure Faraday Future in bankruptcy. (That executive, along with a few others who left Faraday Future, went on to found the company that is now Canoo.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vScFHu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;financial house of cards&lt;/a&gt; that Jia had built Faraday Future out of looked ready to collapse. Then, at the end of 2017, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16801846/faraday-future-funding-investment-payroll-jia-yueting-ceo"&gt;company got a mysterious lifeline&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17242406/faraday-future-china-investment"&gt;reported in April 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the money came from Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande through a series of offshore shell companies. Evergrande pledged $2 billion in total — with $800 million up front and the rest to come in installments. Faraday Future was saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHVqIi"&gt;Until it wasn’t. Jia spent through that money faster than Evergrande expected. Evergrande agreed to give Faraday Future an advance on the remaining investment but only &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;Jia gave up some control. Jia technically did this, but he merely transferred his controlling shares to the daughter of his right-hand woman, Faraday Future VP Chaoying Deng (who I covered in this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;2017 investigation&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVnqMz"&gt;Evergrande was displeased with this. The two sides spent months fighting in a Hong Kong court over the disagreement. Meanwhile, Faraday Future was basically out of money again. It furloughed hundreds of employees, then laid many of them off. Most of the top executives who had held on finally left, including Jia’s last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18040936/faraday-future-founder-resigns-employee-furlough-shutdown"&gt;remaining co-founder&lt;/a&gt;. Faraday Future eventually settled with Evergrande at the end of 2018 and spent much of 2019 in a sort of hibernation, though it took a few more drastic measures to generate cash to keep the lights on, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18269081/faraday-future-sold-headquarters-la-leasing-ev-electric-car"&gt;selling its own headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5kq19"&gt;In early 2019, Faraday Future made a few decisions that are arguably the reason it survived long enough to take advantage of the SPAC boom and become a public company. First, it started working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18524108/faraday-future-bankruptcy-expert-birch-lake-loan"&gt;a restructuring firm run by a bankruptcy guru&lt;/a&gt;. Working with this firm, Faraday Future convinced the many suppliers that were owed money to exchange their claims for pieces of a trust that would pay out if and when the startup raised money. It also helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22380333/faraday-future-spac-psac-ipo-public-investigation-ffie"&gt;refinance some of the startup’s debt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wI1bme"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faraday Future’s still haunted by the past of its billionaire founder","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zoGqXX"&gt;Then, it hired another former BMW executive, Carsten Breitfeld, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;used to run the BMW i8 program&lt;/a&gt;. Breitfeld became CEO (as well as a sort of adult in the room) and has been the face of the startup’s fundraising efforts ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZKIm"&gt;Lastly, Jia filed for personal bankruptcy to settle $3.6 billion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21268043/court-jia-yueting-faraday-future-bankruptcy-plan"&gt;his personal debt in China&lt;/a&gt;. The way this was done was crucial to Faraday Future’s current fortunes. Jia placed nearly all of his controlling stake in the startup in a trust that his own creditors now own pieces of — much like the way Faraday Future settled its debts with suppliers. That means he no longer has the same kind of dictatorial control over the company that he once enjoyed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5lacD"&gt;Faraday Future survived 2020 thanks in part to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228241/faraday-future-loan-ev-startup-sba-ppp-workhorse-lucid-motors-rivian"&gt;$9 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program&lt;/a&gt; and finished the year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22380333/faraday-future-spac-psac-ipo-public-investigation-ffie"&gt;just $1 million in the bank&lt;/a&gt;. But by that time it had already been in talks with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp., a SPAC that had originally set out to merge with a company in the real estate sector. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;announced the merger in January 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC7BuT"&gt;Now that Faraday Future is listed on the Nasdaq, the startup says it will take a year to get its electric SUV into production. The company has grand plans beyond that — it’s still trying to be that major disruptor that it claimed to be at CES 2016 — but it won’t be able to take a crack at them until it gets its first car out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVwl5z"&gt;Or, perhaps, it will. Faraday Future has survived so many brushes with death to date, and the financial markets are currently so receptive to young electric vehicle startups with no revenue, that it’s actually kind of hard to imagine how things could go really wrong in the near-term. But if there’s one lesson to be learned from Faraday Future’s first seven years, it’s that you should always expect the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be adding voice effects to Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ksH0UZ"&gt;Twitter may be adding voice effects to its audio chat platform Spaces, a post from Twitter sleuth &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1418012132621254659?s=20"&gt;Jane Manchum Wong suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Wong tweeted that her research found Twitter is working on something called Voice Transformer, that will allow users to change their voice pitch or add echo effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ppJ1Ry"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on Voice Transformer for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterSpaces&lt;/a&gt; which changes your voice pitch or adds echo to your audio &lt;a href="https://t.co/EgSvherbnL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EgSvherbnL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1418012132621254659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OPOvmH"&gt;Twitter began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;rolling out Spaces&lt;/a&gt; in its iOS app to a limited group of people in June 2020. It added an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309629/twitter-launches-spaces-android-ios-audio-clubhouse"&gt;Android app in March&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22363221/twitter-spaces-desktop-web-browsers-clubhouse"&gt;desktop version&lt;/a&gt; in April (which Wong also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1377751312457027585?s=20"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEPE2h"&gt;Sound effects may sound like a minor feature, but it could make the app more accessible. The pitch control in particular could prove hugely useful to people who are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/glkk8x/too_selfconscious_to_do_voice_chat_in_games/"&gt;self-conscious&lt;/a&gt; about how their voices sound in online forums, and for women subjected to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-018-9962-0"&gt;voice-related harassment&lt;/a&gt; or who deal with the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/07/23/425608745/from-upspeak-to-vocal-fry-are-we-policing-young-womens-voices"&gt;over-policing of their vocal styles&lt;/a&gt;. And for people who prefer to remain anonymous on Twitter, this could be a way to disguise their voices but still participate in Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph97EM"&gt;Twitter didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Thursday, but Wong’s research is typically solid. For instance, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;Tip Jar&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;, its subscription service, ahead of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;official launches&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
