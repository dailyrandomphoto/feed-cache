    <title>2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="macbook pro 2012" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fylJ4YurnOJCx0mBtJCSSD6stI=/94x0:547x302/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014785/macbook-pro-2012.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kOeI7V"&gt;Apple just announced new versions of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; explicitly designed around their new Arm-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. Both models are configurable with either CPU and can be equipped with up to 8TB of storage. Models that use the M1 Pro can have up to 32GB of unified memory, while models that have the M1 Max can be configured to have up to 64GB. They also feature more powerful speakers and a greater selection of ports, making them more versatile than the MacBooks that only offered USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4. (You no longer need a dongle for HDMI or SD cards.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GkmecT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 biggest announcements from Apple’s Unleashed event ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5Ddl9e"&gt;The last generation of MacBook Pro still has plenty of power, and for a while was the best option in terms of connectivity for Apple laptops. However, the advent of the M1 CPU in last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;changed what we expect from our MacBooks&lt;/a&gt;, a new bar that currently can’t be met by the older Intel and AMD-based MacBooks in most ways. If you’re a long-time Apple user, it’s hard to go wrong by upgrading to anything that uses the Apple Silicon architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmSAUp"&gt;While all of the MacBooks currently available on the Apple store use some form of the M1 CPU, they’re all just a little bit different, so to help you weigh your options, we’ve put together charts comparing every current MacBook you can buy on the Apple Store, as well as another chart comparing current models to their predecessors if you’re someone that’s been waiting to upgrade. We even threw in the last MacBook Pro that included an HDMI port to show just how far we’ve come since 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ADr6g8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10814420"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTFcSm"&gt;The new Pros have made some excellent strides in terms of their displays, with 120Hz refresh rates in all the available models, as well as improving the resolution and significantly raising the max brightness. The webcam has also received an upgrade to 1080p. While it’s no surprise that the new versions of the MacBook Pro trump their predecessors in just about every category in terms of performance, the race gets a little more competitive when stacking up the models that you can currently get on the Apple Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7YvwrL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10814467"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPFrjb"&gt;The M1 Air is the most sensible option for users that want a budget-friendly laptop. Unless you need a brighter display, better audio, or battery life, there's little reason to go with the 13-inch version of the MacBook Pro. However, this new breed of MacBook Pro definitely makes a more convincing argument for spending the extra cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7Rmezh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Want a fully specced-out MacBook Pro? You’ll have to pay more than $6,000 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733173/macbook-pro-specced-out-high-end-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2YSsqB"&gt;At the lower end of the spectrum, the starting configuration for the 14-inch MacBook Pro costs twice as much as the MacBook Air, but has a larger screen with better resolution and far more ports. You also get twice the amount of memory and storage right out of the gate. The main drawback of opting for the 14-inch Pro is that it's slightly heavier and won’t last quite as long between charges when compared to its smaller siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x2CEmy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="72notT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cBrcIE"&gt;For an additional $500, the starting price of the 16-inch MacBook Pro will net you many of the same benefits, with the same amount of memory and storage to start, just with a slightly better processor. While the battery of the 16-inch Pro has more staying power, this model is easily the heaviest out of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aEFgd5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Bwec7n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXkbvP"&gt;There are plenty of reasons to spring for a new MacBook Pro, especially if you’ve been biding your time with an older model. The M1 CPU is certainly worth the investment, but unless you can’t live without a dedicated HDMI port, or need a particularly powerful laptop, the MacBook Air is probably the way to go. However, if you’re a power-user or creator that needs bleeding-edge performance, the new 16-inch MacBook Pro seems like the clear winner — we’ll find out for sure in our upcoming reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine showdown at the radio station conglomerate</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Politicon 2018 - Day 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Agi1DRCfJZPtGfzKT4KmV7a9ER0=/58x0:4054x2664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014731/1052717298.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ev6iOG"&gt;Happy Tuesday, y’all. Welcome to the week. As I mentioned in my Thursday &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod Insider&lt;/em&gt;, I saw &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; on Friday — loved it. I didn’t know this movie was only part one of two, though! Unfair! Anyway, the podcast news is trickling out this week, and by trickle, I truly mean a drop or two for us to savor, so today’s a fairly short one. Insiders will get more on Thursday and Friday. Reminder that if you want to keep up with all the audio news fit for a newsletter, you can subscribe &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure your boss will be happy to expense it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZ32w2"&gt;On we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfwpWB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public radio + print newspapers = love ??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODJDjK"&gt;Our Insiders got an early peek at this on Friday, but for the rest of you, Aria Bracci, my fellow &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; writer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22496652"&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; how public radio stations are throwing print newspapers a lifeline. Newspapers have something public media wants: time-worn reporters with a knack for sniffing out local stories, particularly in the true crime vein. While public media has something newspapers want: a way to raise money — memberships — and nonprofit status. The synergy between the two is most recently playing out with my hometown public media company Chicago Public Media, owner of WBEZ, and the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; (I grew up in a &lt;em&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt; household, for what it’s worth). The two media entities are currently in talks to merge, and to quote the story, here are the stakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoDTJL"&gt;“Since 2004, US newspapers have&lt;a href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/loss-newspapers-readers/"&gt; shut down at a rate of 100 per year&lt;/a&gt;, a pace that’s&lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/locally/2021/the-coronavirus-has-closed-more-than-60-local-newsrooms-across-america-and-counting/"&gt; only accelerated&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the pandemic. To stay afloat, some smaller newsrooms have given up independence, being bought by&lt;a href="https://www.cnhi.com/"&gt; news conglomerates&lt;/a&gt; or becoming joint entities with other local outlets — and public radio and TV stations have increasingly offered themselves up&lt;a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/public-media-mergers-playbook-2/"&gt; as partners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/wnyc-other-public-radio-stations-acquire-gothamist-and-sister-sites/"&gt; New York Public Radio acquiring the website Gothamist&lt;/a&gt; was one of nine similar deals in recent years, triggering researchers to document the trend by creating the&lt;a href="https://publicmediamergers.org/about/"&gt; Public Media Mergers Project&lt;/a&gt;. Public radio has been a particularly strong force, holding its ground amid digitization and the podcasting craze (partially because it’s participated in it), and it might be strong enough to help print do the same thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zq50qE"&gt;Podcasting to the rescue! Check out the full piece on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22496652"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Okay, speaking of public media — let’s get into our next story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TOOPs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulus radio star Dan Bongino challenges company’s vaccine mandate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNRLRs"&gt;Radio station conglomerate Cumulus, like many companies, instated a vaccine mandate in August for employees looking to return to the office. Also like many companies, employees complied, and life went on, or they didn’t, and they were fired or quit. Again, life went on. Except Cumulus now has one key problem: Dan Bongino. Bongino, for the uninitiated, is Cumulus’ Rush Limbaugh replacement and a mega-podcaster on his own. He’s a right-wing pundit type and a former cop. Cumulus, for its part, owns hundreds of radio stations and operates the Westwood One podcast network, home to Ben Shapiro and Mark Levin, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHxZhi"&gt;Bongino issued an ultimatum to Cumulus this week, per &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/dan-bongino-dares-cumulus-media-to-cancel-his-radio-show-over-stupid-vax-mandate"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.insideradio.com/free/more-cumulus-employees-let-go-after-refusing-to-abide-with-vaccine-mandate/article_010d9afc-2dcb-11ec-a211-e7c70819bbf2.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Radio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “You can have me or you can have the [vaccine] mandate. But you can’t have both of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoXx2G"&gt;Seems like a bind! But here’s the strange thing: Bongino is vaccinated because he’s a cancer survivor. So this is just a political statement in defense of all the people who chose not to get vaccinated. My guy, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTsRET"&gt;I’d love to chat with some Cumulus or Westwood employees about this, so if you’re one of them, please do get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg3aIn"&gt;Alright on to more radio news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSjHqp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NPR launches an ad campaign for podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmt67b"&gt;On the heels of Spotify &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/spotify-wants-you-for-its-ad-marketplace/"&gt;launching an ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; to attract podcast advertisers, NPR has also jumped into the marketing fray with a new video ad. The ad opens with a question — “What’s happening on NPR Podcasts?” — and then goes on to name a few subjects the network’s podcasts cover: “tacos, flourishing hippos, celeb chihuahuas.” A spokesperson tells me the ads will run on Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, various digital billboards, and elsewhere. Basically, they’re everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmocCf"&gt;Unlike Spotify’s recent campaign, this one is more designed to target potential listeners and, in particular, people of color. Chief marketing officer Michael Smith says in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2021/10/14/1044042036/more-voices-all-ears"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, “Over 75 percent of people of color are unaware of the NPR brand.” This is a shocking statistic, but I suppose good on NPR for recognizing this almost complete lack of brand awareness. Will YouTube ads help? Perhaps. I do wonder what kind of targeting is taking place here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TrW0T"&gt;I bring this ad up not just because of the demographics issue but also to point out the increasing investment across media companies in marketing their own podcasts. I stood on the subway platform the other day for 10 minutes or so and saw not only an ad for Spotify podcasts but also New York City’s own podcast that I didn’t even know the city operated. (I have separate questions about this.) Obviously, if you want to increase advertiser investment in a space, you have to make sure enough people are listening to the programming, so if this ad is successful, it not only means more ears but also more money. It’s only a matter of time until we see Facebook advertising its podcast work, too, and Amazon Music, and everyone else, so get ready to see a lot more podcast-marketing ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJuo7J"&gt;Okay, enough of that and onto a few Apple tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c955xb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNlQYO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple demystifies the automatic download&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPRbjW"&gt;Many people in podcasting have lots of feelings around automatic episode downloads, and I won’t litigate them here. Last week, though, Apple &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/1662-automatic-downloads-on-apple-podcasts"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a page meant to clarify how its automatic downloads work. I suspect many of you reading this have a good sense of this system already, but a couple things stuck out to me that are at least worth a reminder. For one: If a listener hasn’t played a show they follow for more than 15 days or hasn’t played the last five episodes, whichever occurs first, Apple pauses those automatic downloads. As soon as the listener starts tuning in again, those downloads resume with the caveat that listeners can always adjust that setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9J36Oq"&gt;The second bit that stood out to me is how Apple Podcasts calls downloads out as a poor indicator of audience interest and designed for the listeners: “They are not designed to measure listener engagement and may provide an incomplete view of this behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyF1H0"&gt;So, where can a podcaster go to obtain truly accurate data? Apple Podcasts itself, duh. Following that quote, Apple promotes its &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/871-featured-explore-new-analytics-features"&gt;own analytics backend&lt;/a&gt; along with supporting backlinks on how to use the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AK5vCP"&gt;The company is essentially positioning its backend as the place to get the most reliable analytics because if a podcaster checked their hosting provider’s analytics, it would account for all the Apple Podcasts automatic downloads, not just the folks who actually tapped play. This is funny to me because downloads are broadly a mess of Apple’s own making — it could stop supporting them tomorrow if it wanted — but it also simultaneously gives the company a leg up on the competition. Alright!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HOiST"&gt;Now, let’s quickly enter Apple events world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvT2ky"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple launches a voice-only Apple Music tier and new AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56foz1"&gt;None of Apple’s announcements from yesterday’s event directly pertain to podcasts, but as readers of this newsletter know by now, we’re interested in all things audio — and I imagine some of these updates speak to industry trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHQFzu"&gt;First, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-the-next-generation-of-airpods/"&gt;announced third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; with the headline feature of supporting Dolby Atmos. (This feature legit terrified me when I was watching &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; on a plane recently — why does the sword sound like it’s coming from behind me?? No thank you!) This support means people can listen to Dolby Atmos-mixed music on Apple Music, as well as audio and video programming from other apps that support the feature, like HBO Max and Netflix. Notably, Apple Podcasts doesn’t support Dolby Atmos, despite Dolby now &lt;a href="https://professional.dolby.com/podcast"&gt;directly marketing itself&lt;/a&gt; to podcasters and some companies, like QCODE, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273072/podcast-audio-3d-dolby-atmos-iheart-qcode"&gt;using the tech&lt;/a&gt; for its shows. Which makes me ask: Dolby Atmos Apple Podcasts collab when??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU8vZf"&gt;Apple also announced its new Apple Music Voice Plan, which costs $4.99/month. The low price comes with a tradeoff: you can only interact with the platform through Siri. Yes, that’s right, Siri. I know everyone loves to drag Siri for good reason, namely because it’s a weak smart assistant and barely comprehends things, but at the same time, I find this development potentially important. There might be a whole tier of people interacting with music solely through spoken word, which I anticipate translating over to podcasts eventually. I wrote about this possibility in my piece last week about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722468/spotify-amazon-facebook-audio-podcast-polls-interact"&gt;interactive podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. Once you’re used to interacting with a smart assistant in this way, you’ll want to keep interacting. (For what it’s worth, Amazon Music also sells an Echo-only subscription for $3.99.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h15SP1"&gt;A couple more small things for us to note, and I’ll let you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C449kD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netflix faces employee revolt over Dave Chappelle comedy special&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flvCAF"&gt;For those of you who haven’t been following along, here are the key beats for this story: Dave Chappelle released a new Netflix comedy special that makes jokes about transgender people. Employees are furious, saying the jokes are transphobic, and data about the show’s performance &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;leaked to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while employees are planning a walkout this week and have issued demands. Netflix, for its part, is doubling down on the special and refuses to take it down in any way. It’s a mess, to put it simply. Now, why do I mention this here? Well, we’ve heard similar discourse around one very prominent, tech company-sanctioned podcaster: Joe Rogan. The model for how employees respond to this type of content is being cast now, and employees at Spotify might take note. What happens the next time Rogan makes a controversial comment about transgender people? Spotify might be sweating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seceWZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bill to watch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhB8Y9"&gt;A group of senators is planning to introduce a bill called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;the American Innovation and Choice Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would make it illegal for tech companies to “self-preference” or promote their own products over a competitor’s. A reader (hello and thank you!) wrote in to point out the possible repercussions this might have on Spotify, Amazon, Facebook, and anyone else who might be incentivized to promote their own podcasts over anyone else’s. I now wonder this, too! It’s early in the process to predict how this bill could play out, and from what I can tell, searching “tech podcast” in Spotify doesn’t automatically bring &lt;em&gt;Reply All&lt;/em&gt; up over any other show, so we might be in the clear for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYjvn4"&gt;Spotify seems to support the legislation, too. Per a boilerplate comment from Horacio Gutierrez, head of global affairs and chief legal officer: “Gatekeeper platforms use their power to distort markets by manufacturing self-serving advantages at the expense of American consumers and competitors ... At Spotify, we welcome the bipartisan introduction of the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and thank Senators Klobuchar and Grassley for their steadfast leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IchoVa"&gt;Definitely something to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPY8Za"&gt;That’s it! I’ll catch you Thursday for another edition of Hot Pod Insider. Until then, as always, you can reach me at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.carman@theverge.com"&gt;ashley.carman@theverge.com&lt;/a&gt;, by replying to this email, or on Twitter. I’m widely available. See ya!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music can now play spatial audio on your favorite headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3b0IpxH45v6yc7HhhSPHEWzwb4=/111x0:948x558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014716/7P9wUy2fNzusM4MUjuKhBh.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdLohy"&gt;Amazon has announced that, beginning today, Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers will be able to listen to spatial audio music tracks with their favorite headphones with the Amazon Music app for Android and iOS. The company is supporting two formats of spatial audio: Dolby Atmos (which is also offered by Apple Music) and Sony’s 360 Reality Audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO8Rp4"&gt;The Atmos mixes are provided by record labels, so the “immersive, multidimensional audio experience” should be largely similar between Amazon and Apple’s services — with the exception of head tracking, which Amazon doesn’t support. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;new third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max all have the option for dynamic head tracking, which provides a unique sound experience as you move your head in various directions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtoeTr"&gt;Amazon has offered spatial audio since 2019, but it was limited to a short list of devices including the Echo Studio and Sony’s SRS-RA5000. Now it’ll work with whatever pair of headphones you’ve got. You’ll see an Atmos or 360 badge in the Amazon Music app when playing spatial audio tracks. Like Apple, Tidal, and others that have gone in on the experience, Amazon claims spatial audio delivers a “multidimensional audio experience, adding space, clarity, and depth that is not achievable with traditional stereo music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7jciv"&gt;But as I found when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;sampling Apple Music’s initial batch of spatial audio tracks&lt;/a&gt;, quality can vary wildly and producers / artists need to put some work into Atmos mixes for them to sound their best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NUr2gf"&gt;Also starting today, Amazon Music subscribers will get access to lossless HD and hi-res Ultra HD audio tracks without having to upgrade their account to do so. Amazon dropped the extra premium it had been charging for lossless on the same day that Apple began streaming the high-quality files, but you still technically had to add the feature to your account. Now it’ll just be a regular part of the service for all Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers. Amazon says it has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G8X4YJYLED87FSH2"&gt;over 75 million songs&lt;/a&gt; available in the CD-quality HD tier and “millions” in Ultra HD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ebPTk"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited is priced at $9.99 per month (or $7.99 for Prime subscribers). The cheaper &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKLDPRYNF2VUAKMM"&gt;single device plan&lt;/a&gt; does not allow for HD, Ultra HD, or spatial audio playback. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 140W charger can fast charge a lot more than just your MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2mgx7QZTzDUej-vXITdzXMtgqEE=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014599/MLYU3_AV1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new 140W charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eXiYsp"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYU3AM/A/140w-usb-c-power-adapter?fnode=734a3f2e2d2e806ace8f7808dbb8ba4fd9782dff052da988f418e42ddc3d1a858ec62035f6c5248f220833045d3ac0aab4b093470d39f30395579a4d66521e498d4f45ce651cc927ed283f18e9ec2f2910ffce4b0b4892e5732214994c235270"&gt;140W charging brick&lt;/a&gt;, which works with a new MagSafe charging cable to power the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, uses the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702453/usb-c-pd-240-watt-charging-usb4-data-transfer-logo-branding-standard"&gt;USB-C Power Delivery 3.1 standard&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. As well as being included with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, the brick is available separately for $99 (not including the USB-C-to-MagSafe cable, which costs &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYV3AM/A/usb-c-to-magsafe-3-cable-2-m"&gt;an extra $49&lt;/a&gt;). Meanwhile, the new 14-inch MacBook Pros come with 67W and 96W chargers, depending on the exact model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLZfCM"&gt;Using the USB-C PD 3.1 standard means Apple’s new charging brick will be cross compatible with other devices that use the same power delivery standard, which was announced earlier this year alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr"&gt;USB Type-C Release 2.1 specification&lt;/a&gt;. It also means that MacBook owners have the flexibility of using compatible third-party charging bricks with the new MacBooks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8iaKOdN_yKeIIFl_jD6OuOE_oHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938315/MLYU3_AV2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 140W charger has a single USB-C port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pFmzYu"&gt;That hasn’t been the case with some USB-C laptop fast chargers in the past, which have had to go off-spec to offer charging speeds over 100W (the previous cap on the USB-C Power Delivery spec). My colleague Sean Hollister, for example, has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr#:~:text=Previously%2C%20the%20USB,Leaving%20100W%20behind"&gt;Dell dock that outputs 130W&lt;/a&gt;, but it won’t work with other laptops because there previously wasn’t an open standard to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw0ChM"&gt;As well as its use of the USB-C PD 3.1 standard, Apple also confirmed that the brick is its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051974/gallium-nitride-anker-material-silicon-semiconductor-energy"&gt;gallium nitride (GaN)&lt;/a&gt; charger, which means it’s using the material that allows companies to build higher-powered chargers that are smaller in size than their traditional counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BChu3D"&gt;As well as the specs of the charging brick, Apple also confirmed that any of the new MacBooks’ Thunderbolt 4 ports can be used to charge the laptops. On the 14-inch MacBook Pro, these ports can be used for fast charging; but fast charging the 16-inch MacBook Pro requires using MagSafe 3 and the 140W adapter because the Thunderbolt 4 predates the USB-C PD 3.1 standard and tops out at 100W. Lower wattage chargers will be able to provide power to the MacBooks, but Apple says charging may be slower or could even result in power drain if the laptop is using more power than it’s being provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGg6qx"&gt;Additionally, Apple says that the magnets used in the MagSafe 3 connector are stronger than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taqmIz"&gt;All in all, it’s great news for anyone planning on buying one of Apple’s new MacBooks; they’ll get a capable fast charger that can power other devices and also aren’t restricted to using Apple’s own brick to charge their laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s Halloween event turns Ariana Grande into ‘the galaxy’s greatest monster hunter’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dezU-tWko-tm50sRL6NlIey-LRA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014560/Fortnitemares_2021___The_Convergence.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="50Mkfp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s big Halloween event, Fortnitemares, is making its return. But this year’s edition comes with a fun twist: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;one-time &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; performer Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt; is now officially part of the game’s lore, with a questline that turns her into “the galaxy’s greatest monster hunter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meU9nn"&gt;The event runs from today until November 2nd, and — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;in keeping with this season’s theme&lt;/a&gt; — it’s centered on the ever-present cubes that now dominate &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s island. The story event is called “The Wrath of the Cube Queen,” and developer Epic describes it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6fCOA9"&gt;Since Fortnitemares began (and even before), the cubes have been mobilizing. Their migration towards the island’s center wasn’t just to spread corruption — they’re now at the center forming the Convergence. What is the purpose of this mysterious structure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAm1c1"&gt;You’ve come across the cubes and fought back the cube monsters, but a new force has joined their ranks: Caretakers are the Cube Queen’s strongest warriors yet. Tall, foreboding, shadowy apparitions, their spectral tendrils pull you directly into the sideways for a showdown on their home turf. Survive a Caretaker’s assault and you’ll walk away all the richer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpziAi"&gt;Things don’t end there. The Cube Queen’s wrath has given rise to a new sideways weapon — the sinister sideways scythe — as well as returning items like witch brooms and the pumpkin rocket launcher. Use the scythe and these wicked supplies to hold your own in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="xNoMN7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n2pGPT3jAI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KrV2Dm"&gt;The event will also include the return of the Horde Rush mode, as well as new quests from several characters. This is where Grande comes in: a new version of her, called “Spacefarer Ariana Grande,” will be introducing a questline about hunting monsters. As per usual, completing quests will unlock some free goodies like gliders and pickaxes. Check them out in the gallery below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="okwgH6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10814251"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YYqTmf"&gt;While the main event itself is starting now, Epic has been getting into the Halloween spirit for the last week or so, with new additions to the game ranging from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;’s Rick Grimes to Frankenstein’s monster to a skeleton designed by street artist Kaws. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710510/fortnite-fortnitemares-halloween-event-spooky-short-film-festival-epic-games"&gt;There’s even a short film festival coming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s latest live-action Cowboy Bebop teaser makes bounty hunting look easy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcZZ0a2Wb_03LjO1YBHp_07O1Qc=/534x0:3087x1702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014554/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_8.08.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5KbShh"&gt;It’s still not a full trailer, but Netflix showed off the best look yet at its upcoming live-action &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; adaptation in a new teaser to celebrate the one-month countdown to the show’s debut on November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqH5Js"&gt;Like the previous teasers for the show (which so far have included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"&gt;stills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691323/cowboy-bebop-netflix-opening-title-sequence-watch"&gt;the opening credits&lt;/a&gt;), the latest video, titled “Cowboy Bebop: The Lost Session,” isn’t actually made up of footage from the show but does show off the key trio of Spike Spiegel (John Cho), Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir), and Faye Valentine (Daniella Pineda) in action as they hunt down a bounty, get some noodles, and fight through an army of thugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AgRa9W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop is out on November 19th, check out the first photos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"},{"title":"Watch the opening title sequence for Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22691323/cowboy-bebop-netflix-opening-title-sequence-watch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gKuKrR"&gt;That said, it's a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;fun teaser, shot with kinetic, color-coded shifting frames that bounce between Spike, Jet, and Faye as they bicker and brawl back and forth. Translating anime to live-action is always a trickier proposition, but hopefully, the actual show can manage a similar energy when it comes to Netflix next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzvD6g"&gt;It is still somewhat concerning that Netflix still hasn’t shown off any actual footage of Cowboy Bebop yet, but the official Cowboy Bebop twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bebopnetflix/status/1450431536826929160"&gt;has promised that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; trailer will be out next week&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, the classic anime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723502/netflix-original-cowboy-bebop-anime-watch-before-live-action-adaptation"&gt;starts streaming on Netflix on October 21st&lt;/a&gt;, so you’ll be able to catch up in time for the remake next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAG2u0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 19th, 8:15am: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;additional information on the main trailer release. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How public radio is trying to save print</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FVSUQHREagtAGPk8VQVYpocbsVU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014495/newspaperRadio.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Why Chicago Public Media and the Chicago Sun-Times are exploring a merger&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="o1eiS8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; needs help. After being bought and sold several times over the last decade, the 73-year-old paper is looking for a more stable home to continue its award-winning reporting — and it may have finally found it in an unexpected place: a radio station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwrNBb"&gt;Chicago Public Media, which owns the radio station WBEZ, is currently in talks with the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; to merge. A final deal would combine their newsrooms and audiences in hopes of creating a financially stable enterprise for both teams. Similar mergers and acquisitions have become a common way to bolster the struggling print industry, but if radio were to take on a major newspaper, that would be a first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8jDnH"&gt;“Audio is a growth business,” says Jim Friedlich, chief executive of &lt;a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/"&gt;The Lenfest Institute for Journalism&lt;/a&gt;, who advised CPM on the potential merger. “Now Chicago Public Media and other media with audio roots have both the wherewithal and the self-confidence to take a bold step like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJUIc5"&gt;Since 2004, US newspapers have &lt;a href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/loss-newspapers-readers/"&gt;shut down at a rate of 100 per year&lt;/a&gt;, a pace that’s &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/locally/2021/the-coronavirus-has-closed-more-than-60-local-newsrooms-across-america-and-counting/"&gt;only accelerated&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the pandemic. To stay afloat, some smaller newsrooms have given up independence, being bought by &lt;a href="https://www.cnhi.com/"&gt;news conglomerates&lt;/a&gt; or becoming joint entities with other local outlets — and public radio and TV stations have increasingly offered themselves up &lt;a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/public-media-mergers-playbook-2/"&gt;as partners&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/wnyc-other-public-radio-stations-acquire-gothamist-and-sister-sites/"&gt;New York Public Radio acquiring the website &lt;em&gt;Gothamist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was one of nine similar deals in recent years, triggering researchers to document the trend by creating the &lt;a href="https://publicmediamergers.org/about/"&gt;Public Media Mergers Project&lt;/a&gt;. Public radio has been a particularly strong force, holding its ground amid digitization and the podcasting craze (partially because it’s &lt;em&gt;participated in it&lt;/em&gt;), and it might be strong enough to help print do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="4HQo0d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD8cgK"&gt;WBEZ may be particularly well suited to supporting the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;. The station is a big name, pulling in 550,000 weekly broadcast listeners, according to CEO Matt Moog, while also being the audio house that brought us &lt;em&gt;Wait Wait... Don’t Tell Me!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Moog tells me the organization has been “breakeven or better for the past seven years, even through the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRzUU7"&gt;Part of the financial health of public media stations in general involves the &lt;a href="https://www.501c3.org/frequently-asked-questions/what-benefit-does-being-501c3-offer-my-nonprofit-and-its-contributors/"&gt;financial perks of being a nonprofit&lt;/a&gt;. Listeners and viewers are incentivized to donate since contributions are tax-deductible, and the organizations are exempt from corporate income taxes (as well as sales and property taxes, in some cases). They can apply for grants reserved for nonprofits while reserving the right to pull at heartstrings — and wallets — by saying their programming is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBDHfAevWxg"&gt;funded by “viewers like you.”&lt;/a&gt; In addition to more than a dozen or so public-media mergers in the past decade, there have also been cases of newspapers &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/04/historic-shift-salt-lake/?utm_source=Hot+Pod&amp;amp;utm_campaign=0d5b5da4cc-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_9_23_2021_9_51_COPY_01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_f85dcd1354-0d5b5da4cc-92382929"&gt;converting to&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/news/h-f-lenfest-launches-institute-journalism-new-media-donates-philadelphia-inquirer-daily-news-philly-com-makes-20-million-gift-new-endowment-ensure-future/"&gt;becoming affiliated with&lt;/a&gt; a nonprofit without the support of NPR or PBS affiliates in order to access these exact benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLWK8J"&gt;Newspaper closures, on the other hand, have been &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/local-journalism-in-crisis-why-america-must-revive-its-local-newsrooms/"&gt;attributed&lt;/a&gt; to fewer paid subscriptions, as consumers flock to free sites and social media, and the resulting disinterest of advertisers. Between 2008 and 2018, it’s estimated that advertising revenue for newspapers &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/local-journalism-in-crisis-why-america-must-revive-its-local-newsrooms/#footnote-2"&gt;dropped by 68%&lt;/a&gt;, even as digital advertising revenue increased for those same publications. What’s more, certain types of local reporting — public-service and investigative journalism in particular — are often the most expensive, says Friedlich. Many local public-service stories involve “long lead times” and “deep investigations,” he says, as well as steps that are relevant to a story’s locale, like doing environmental testing or submitting freedom of information requests to local government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zyORN7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WBEZ reaches 550,000 weekly broadcast listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k4bns5"&gt;When donations are incentivized by nonprofit status, they can help cover those costs. In 2016, The Lenfest Institute, a nonprofit, &lt;a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/news/h-f-lenfest-launches-institute-journalism-new-media-donates-philadelphia-inquirer-daily-news-philly-com-makes-20-million-gift-new-endowment-ensure-future/"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/em&gt; newspaper, making contributions tax-deductible if they’re made to the institute to support the &lt;em&gt;Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;. Under this arrangement, Friedlich says, the resulting&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;donor support has comprised “a critical 5 percent” of the paper’s annual revenue, being used for “meaningful initiatives in digital transformation, investigative news, and diversity, equity and inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzAQu2"&gt;Public radio has taken the already powerful funding strategy of nonprofits and made it its own. Stations across the US have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2013/10/22/236245578/not-another-pledge-drive"&gt;established a reputation&lt;/a&gt; that they will ask for — and receive — donations from listeners, and it’s also commonplace to hear that a “generous donor” agreed to match fundraiser contributions or that a certain program was “sponsored” by a local business. Strong public radio stations “have built out sophisticated developments and business-side teams,” says Elizabeth Hansen-Shapiro, lead researcher for the Public Media Mergers Project and CEO of the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaltrustforlocalnews.org/"&gt;National Trust for Local News&lt;/a&gt;. “They have a really strong basis of financial support, in terms of major gifts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; membership &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sponsorship. The business model itself is pretty robust and diversified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kaN6G"&gt;This may be how CPM and the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; could stand to succeed. Though exact plans are still in flux as CPM and the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; iron out the formal deal, they’re said to take several cues from what public radio already does well. For one, Moog says, he intends to apply public radio’s financial infrastructure to the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; existing efforts: the news site would no longer have a paywall, he says, but instead a membership program with a free tier, “the same way it happens with public media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mKgo8M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Sun-Times could end up focusing on memberships over subscribers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ucIle"&gt;Taking cues from public radio will also mean, quite simply, producing audio. It’s a strength of both teams, according to Moog, who says that future plans could include podcasts, “interactive audio chats,” or &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; staff reporting on air. The teams have had success collaborating on audio before, with the &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/9/20/20854262/motive-podcast-episode-1-download-listen"&gt;true-crime podcast &lt;em&gt;Motive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WBEZ’s vice president of communications tells me the show has been downloaded several million times; that number includes downloads for subsequent seasons that were produced without the&lt;em&gt; Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;, but Moog describes the initial season as one of the most successful podcast products WBEZ has produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fhR5u"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/motive/id1479220905"&gt;Apple ratings&lt;/a&gt; can serve as a crude metric, &lt;em&gt;Motive&lt;/em&gt; might have outperformed &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/pages/podcasts"&gt;other &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; podcasts&lt;/a&gt; as well, gaining a few thousand ratings as opposed to &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-best-movies-with-richard-roeper-and-roe-conn/id1488397079"&gt;a few dozen&lt;/a&gt;. The task of getting the podcast in front of so many listeners was supported by CPM’s ability to broadcast promotional material to its millions of monthly listeners, and the show likely gained traction because of podcast listeners’ existing fascination with true crime, which was bolstered by the &lt;em&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;’ investigative reporting chops. In the audioverse, it was a match made in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhDdAp"&gt;There are still risks for radio, of course, as well as for the outlets they take on. In the time that’s passed since New York Public Radio bought and revived &lt;em&gt;Gothamist &lt;/em&gt;in 2018, it’s struggled financially. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://current.org/2021/04/new-york-public-radio-lays-off-14-staffers-including-newsroom-leaders/"&gt;14 people were laid off&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;Gothamist&lt;/em&gt;’s editor in chief, as one of several measures to reduce a multi-million-dollar deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCHRHZ"&gt;Both Moog and Hansen-Shapiro expressed that the example of NYPR shouldn’t be cause for concern about the state of public media, which Moog describes as “generally quite healthy.” Public radio benefits from many of the same feel-good, “intimate” elements that have given podcasts their foothold, and that’s on top of its ability to broadcast, particularly to people Moog describes as “engaged” and “loyal” listeners. “From a podcasting point of view, our ability to connect with that audience and promote some of the audio work that we’re doing is really significant,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="a5KQ20"&gt;Hansen-Shapiro agrees. In an industry where needs abound, but funding can be tight, “the advantage that public media stations have is that they’ve been at this game a lot longer.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates iMovie to adjust focus in iPhone cinematic mode footage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gr5SwDSEwT7Dzjn67dnacsKoKF4=/73x0:2197x1416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014408/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_12.17.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTR5rg"&gt;Apple has updated the iMovie app for Macs to let users edit and adjust the focus in videos recorded using the iPhone 13’s new “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673545/iphone-13-pro-camera-cinematic-mode-video-features-macro"&gt;cinematic mode&lt;/a&gt;” — though you’ll need to wait until you can update to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22725047/macos-monterey-release-date-compatibility-features-m1-pro-max-chip"&gt;the latest macOS Monterey on October 25th&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZSRt"&gt;Introduced in September with the latest clutch of iPhones, cinematic mode uses machine learning to automatically pull focus to the key part of a frame (usually whatever face is biggest and turned towards the camera). It also lets people tap their phone screen to adjust the focal point while recording, and during playback after the video has been shot. Now, iMovie users who have the latest macOS Monterey will be able to make those same adjustments on their computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGthhm"&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id408981434"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for iMovie 10.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="V3aGZj"&gt;Cinematic Mode&lt;br&gt;• Edit videos recorded on iPhone 13 in Cinematic mode (requires macOS Monterey)&lt;br&gt;• Use the Cinematic control in the inspector to modify the intensity of the depth effect&lt;br&gt;• Choose to focus on faces or other objects by selecting them in the viewer&lt;br&gt;• View and delete focus points in the video timeline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnvs9Z"&gt;Optimized for Apple silicon&lt;br&gt;• Improved performance and efficiency with optimizations for M1 Pro and M1 Max on the new MacBook Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wZMOhD"&gt;Also of note: iMovie has been optimized for the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;M1 Pro and M1 Max chips&lt;/a&gt;, just like &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/10/final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-updated-on-the-new-macbook-pro-with-m1-pro-m1-max/"&gt;Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The new chips are Apple’s most powerful yet (just like every year), with the M1 Pro delivering 70 percent better CPU performance and twice the graphics performance of the original M1. Check out all the details on the new chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22726444/apple-m1-pro-max-chip-processor-arm-macbook-fastest"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fisher-Price’s iconic Chatter Telephone now makes actual phone calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGZ3ULeWFrvvzLc5MrNwS0ovFFA=/0x486:2000x1819/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014351/6470479cv12d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWK9ZU"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 4 is often held up as a pinnacle of phone design, but what about the Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone? With its friendly features (a big smiley face painted on the front) and mobile design (thanks to its four wheels), the Chatter Telephone has long been the gadget of choice among the aesthetically discerning &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the under-4s. This week, to celebrate the device’s 60th anniversary, Fisher-Price has blown our minds once more with its courage and innovation: the Chatter Telephone now makes and receives phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoS4DB"&gt;The new Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone Bluetooth edition is, admittedly, an accessory rather than fully-fledged mobile device. It connects to your Android or iOS phone over Bluetooth, and, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fisher-prices-iconic-toy-telephone-now-actually-makes-p-1847846984"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can actually dial numbers using the plastic rotary dial and answer and hang up calls by lifting and replacing the handset on the cradle. There’s even a loudspeaker function, for when you’re taking that super important conference to try and nail down &lt;em&gt;who took your nose&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mMbwYd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10815220"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xBxZue"&gt;It’s not all good news though. Rather disappointingly, the $60 gadget charges via the extremely outdated microUSB, but I guess that is an appropriately retrograde choice. The phone is available to preorder &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ffisher-price-chatter-telephone-with-bluetooth%2F6470479.p%3FskuId%3D6470479&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exclusively at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not clear when it will be shipping. You can, at least, rest assured that supplies won’t be affected by the chip shortage, and we expect that more than a few households will be adorning their home offices with one of these beauties come Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has tried everything but building the best phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gusZPuJr34vU1-mHF75a1mAI2qM=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70014329/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2SokbT"&gt;At 1PM ET, Google will try its best to convince millions of people to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;a Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; instead of Apple’s iPhone 13 or a Samsung Galaxy. Will it work? That depends on whether Google does something it’s never managed to do with a phone launch: fire on every cylinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aufYAF"&gt;The Google Pixel has never been the it phone, the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink phone, the phone early adopters crave. Samsung originally cornered the Android side of that market with the Galaxy Note, and it was 2017 when Apple crossed the $1,000 mark with the iPhone X and followed it up with the pricey Pro and Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMdADX"&gt;Google has arguably never had a truly flagship phone to call its own: while the search giant’s incredible camera software has made the Pixel punch above its weight for years, the company’s otherwise been competing in the budget flagship tier. The Pixel, Pixel 2, Pixel 3, and Pixel 5 were all priced to take on an entry-level iPhone, instead of shooting for the moon — which makes some sense, considering how little in the way of marketing, carrier partnerships and raw hardware prowess Google could muster for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqADM8"&gt;While Google has arguably had a hand in every flagship Android phone release going back to the T-Mobile G1 / HTC Dream in 2008 and the Nexus program from 2010 to 2015, it was never in charge of its destiny to the degree an Apple or even Samsung is today. Until 2019’s Pixel 3a, every Google phone relied on a revolving door of third-party smartphone manufacturers for its hardware stack, including Motorola, HTC, LG, and Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rl4L0"&gt;The budget Pixel 3A was the first device to find a sales niche by bringing Google’s excellent camera to a $399 phone (briefly winning &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/idc-google-outsells-oneplus-with-7-2-million-pixel-smartphones-in-2019/"&gt;an estimated 0.4 percent marketshare&lt;/a&gt;). It was also the first phone that was fully developed by a Google team including former HTC designers and engineers. (The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16949366/google-htc-smartphone-pixel-design-team-deal-closed"&gt;acqui-hired them for $1.1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.) After the failure of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt;, that Pixel 3A’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496547/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-play-it-safe"&gt;balance of simplistic design, capable camera and mid-range features&lt;/a&gt; has informed every subsequent Google phone launch — until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Vyjuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6 is a turning point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60X28x"&gt;Google has been signaling for months that the Pixel 6 is a turning point. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;The Google phone is premium again&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t seen Google-branded hardware this comparatively ambitious since the priciest Nexus phones, and we likely haven’t seen a marketing budget this big &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/22/13013766/google-pixel-phone-event-ads-challenge-apple"&gt;since the very first Pixel&lt;/a&gt;, if ever. Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;told us in August&lt;/a&gt; that the company is “ready to invest a lot in marketing” in order to grow the brand, and the budget was apparently significant enough for CFO Ruth Porat to namedrop it on an earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJpOLyDpTxiF9Hkk1BkNW8lfQXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938223/screen.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tgvK7Q"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro also have a design like no other phones, placing their multiple cameras into a huge camera bar reminiscent of a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; droid, with a distinctive pop of color up top. The reported presence of a new 50-megapixel camera that pulls in 150 percent more light shows that Google’s finally moving forward, alongside a wide-angle sensor and a 4x periscope zoom on the Pro — while up front, large curved screens with high refresh rates, hole-punch cameras, and minimal bezels cement the premium look of both phones. They’ve reportedly got gigantic batteries, too, up to 5,000mAh, addressing the biggest issue that sunk the Pixel 4, and an under-display fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nT4q8p"&gt;And for the very first time, a Pixel will have Google’s own chip at its heart: a new SoC called Tensor designed by Google itself with “totally differentiated” AI performance (it may contain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;an unusual combination&lt;/a&gt; of off-the-shelf CPU and GPU cores). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfnvS6"&gt;The idea seems to be that Google will pull an Apple — by controlling the whole hardware and software stack, it could theoretically offer features and optimized performance like we’ve never seen from the company’s previous Qualcomm-based phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZZZYk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22722823/google-pixel-6-pro-event-android-12-magic-eraser-rumors"&gt;According to leaked product pages&lt;/a&gt;, the new Pixels will introduce four perks in particular that likely owe something to the new chip: a Magic Eraser feature that can automatically remove an unwanted object from a photo, a Face Unblur feature that can stabilize a blurry photo, a Live Translate feature for real-time language translation without an internet connection — and a guaranteed five years of security updates. Nevertheless, I have to wonder if any of it will be enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lU9fT"&gt;Apple’s iPhones have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;never been stronger&lt;/a&gt;, with the iPhone 13 lineup improving on the already-capable iPhone 12 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676532/apple-event-iphone-13-incremental-refinement-upgrade-specs"&gt;in practically every way&lt;/a&gt;, and this year it’s the Pixel’s cameras that are playing catch-up. Carriers have been pushing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;unheard of iPhone trade-in deals&lt;/a&gt; that effectively offer even a $1,000 model for “free” over 24 months even if you’re trading in a three-year-old iPhone, making those offers even sweeter. Given the relative value of an old Pixel phone, it’s very hard to imagine AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon offering Google’s customers the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XndZWa"&gt;Leaked prices are giving me pause, too. Multiple sources are reporting Target is internally listing the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro at $599 and $898 respectively. That would mean they start &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; than the Pixel 5, which seems weird — while I’ll happily take a lower price if I can get it, it suggests that Google’s either subsidizing these phones itself (perhaps because it’s not getting that boost from carriers) or it’s cutting some corners. While I would hope Google has figured out its quality control, many of the company’s phones have had some ugly issues in the past, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/31/16957332/lg-bootloop-lawsuit-settlement-g4-v10-v20-nexus-5x-g5"&gt;manufacturing defects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306552/google-huawei-nexus-6p-class-action-lawsuit-settlement-agreement-compensate"&gt;battery issues&lt;/a&gt; that led to bootloops with the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/15/16889854/pixel-2-xl-lg-display-oled-blue-shift"&gt;screen quality control issues with the Pixel 2 XL&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/reports-of-pixel-3s-bricking-with-edl-message-are-growing/"&gt;growing number of mysteriously bricked Pixel 3s&lt;/a&gt;. Some Pixel 5 phones also had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549778/google-pixel-5-display-gap-issue-normal-design"&gt;a weird display gap&lt;/a&gt;. I know people who won’t even consider a Google phone anymore, burned by one too many bootloops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNW7NH"&gt;At the very least, the prices suggest to me that Google probably doesn’t have other premium hardware features up its sleeves — Google might meet the iPhone, but it probably won’t beat it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOWTLS"&gt;Luckily for Google, its definition of success is relative. &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Google-aims-to-double-smartphone-output-with-new-Pixel-6"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google is merely trying to produce 7 million of its new Pixel 6 phones, reportedly only double the company’s smartphone shipments last year. (Apple and Samsung have been known to ship 80 million phones &lt;em&gt;per quarter.&lt;/em&gt;) The company doesn’t need to break the Apple-Samsung duopoly by convincing us to forgo an iPhone or Galaxy this year; it just needs a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mP2Yup"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Easy, right?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbm3YH"&gt;Google just needs a phone that stands out from the pack, a massive marketing and awareness campaign, carrier partnerships across the globe, a class-leading camera, great battery life, speedy performance, an attractive design, good reviews, and no red flags. If it all works out — if Google can hit on all cylinders — perhaps it can use that success as a springboard to go even harder next year.&lt;/p&gt;
