    <title>Apple hasn’t decided whether to appeal the Epic v. Apple ruling</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyYrSd"&gt;Apple is still weighing whether to appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;last week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;antitrust ruling&lt;/a&gt;, the company said today. In a call with reporters, a representative said Apple was still evaluating its legal options and had not made a decision about its next steps. The position contrasts sharply with Epic, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it intends to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpwrPk"&gt;Apple reiterated a position it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;took last week&lt;/a&gt;, casting the ruling as a near-total victory. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers dismissed nine of Epic’s 10 claims, including ones that would have required iOS to allow third-party app stores and payment processors. She ordered Epic to pay damages for breaching its developer contract. Apple also doesn’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;return Epic’s hit game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the iOS App Store, and it can choose to terminate other Epic-affiliated developer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3O8ah"&gt;Apple hasn’t taken a position on whether it will ban any Epic-related apps beyond &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Asked for comment, a representative said Apple is still looking at its options regarding Epic’s future on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qm8ccl"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372480/apple-epic-threat-developer-tools-agreement-unreal-engine-fortnite"&gt;Epic said Apple&lt;/a&gt; might cut off support for the widely used Unreal Engine on iOS — a nuclear option in the conflict between them. That seems theoretically possible now, but Apple has publicly taken a measured tone so far, saying it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667069/fortnite-ios-return-apple-epic-ruling"&gt;“welcome” &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; back into the App Store&lt;/a&gt; if it removed its non-Apple in-app purchase option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XsB9s"&gt;While Apple won most claims, it was found to be violating California’s Unfair Competition Law with its anti-steering rules. A court order will require it to let developers link to alternate payment options outside their apps, although they still need to use Apple’s in-app purchase system within them. That order will take effect in December if Apple doesn’t appeal and win a delay of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtwMqZ"&gt;For now Apple says it’s studying how it could change its rules to comply with the order, which it characterized as line-editing Apple’s terms of service. But unsurprisingly, it doesn’t have any answers to share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What comes next for the App Store?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i46PCnuYdn54rk3JYSgtw-kZ6-0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69852010/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vxzkF"&gt;On September 10th, a verdict finally arrived in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, and it has left the App Store model in a precarious state. Epic wanted to do away with the system entirely, breaking Apple’s control over software distribution on iOS — but the ruling stopped well short of that. Instead, we got an ambiguously worded injunction that seems to open the door to developers skirting Apple’s commission system — or at least making it easier to use non-Apple payment methods outside their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2bJ1Y"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the ruling, Apple pushed to cast it as a victory — and Epic seemed sure it had lost. It’s understandable: until we see how Apple reacts and how the court looks on Epic’s recent appeal, it’s hard to know for sure what the injunction will actually mean. The ruling could be a significant leak in Apple’s carefully controlled ecosystem. But for that to happen, Epic and its allies will need a lot to break in their favor, both inside the courtroom and out. There are still lots of places for Apple to fight, and lots of ways to pare back developers’ small glimmer of a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLtFXm"&gt;Here are the four most important questions from those fights, the questions we’ll be watching particularly closely in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LUEC9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much freedom does this ruling actually give developers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jos2mP"&gt;For all the complexities of the case, the actual order issued by the court is simple. It zeroes in on a single sentence in Apple’s App Store guidelines, which Apple is now forbidden from enforcing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzfyla"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIjpkc"&gt;The one thing that’s clear is that developers have to be allowed some way to forward users to outside payment systems. But as my boss Nilay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;points out here&lt;/a&gt;, the “buttons” clause is ambiguous and could let developers make those systems look a lot like Apple’s official option, even if they open Safari or another app for the actual payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ePca6"&gt;Enforcing that interpretation will take a lot of legal work from developers and a lot of developer-friendly rulings in court. From the other side, there will be lots of opportunities for Apple to chip away at the injunction’s force. It’s hard to say how interested courts will be in defending it. But if they aren’t, the App Store could still be a very risky place for developers using alternate payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMkF8u"&gt;In particular, there’s a real threat that Apple will still be able to impose the so-called Apple tax on whatever new payment system is allowed. In theory, the App Store’s commissions are levied to support the entire store, not just the payment system, and in her ruling, the judge considers the idea of Apple allowing alternate payment methods but requiring the same 30 percent cut via audits or other systems. (My colleague Adi explores this in the seventh section of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;her deep dive on the ruling&lt;/a&gt;, under the heading “Apple could collect an ‘Apple Tax’ even without in-app payment charges.”) If that’s borne out in an actual legal order, the door would slam shut on alternate payment systems pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EDQ92r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will Apple change its App Store rules in response to this ruling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wlIOuT"&gt;The other half of the equation is Apple itself, which is almost certainly going to change its App Store rules if the order stands, if only to change the anti-steering clause. The specific rule about referring to outside payment systems is out, but Apple still has broad legal authority to write its own rules for the App Store. So what new rule will the company write to replace the old one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GU0qdE"&gt;In particular, there are lots of ways Apple could discourage outside payments without banning them entirely. There’s the commission rate idea we’ve already discussed, but Apple could also place restrictions on how outside payment links are presented. The company could require specific price differentials between Apple’s IAP system and any competitors, and it could require the systems to be presented side by side — whatever the company thinks will pass muster with the court and keep developers using the Apple system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1HcdZh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will external payments look like on the App Store?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vEXiBf"&gt;When the dust has settled on both those questions, developers will be left with some alternatives to Apple’s built-in payment system. It could be a simple button or a maze of links and forms — and a lot will be riding on where external payments land on that spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flmTxP"&gt;The specific numbers on this are important, since developers will be balancing the cost of friction against the extra money they get from sidestepping Apple. On the face of it, a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style app will get an extra 30 cents for every dollar of in-app purchases that don’t go through Apple’s system (minus whatever fees the cost of providing the alternative service eats up). But it also seems likely that leaving Apple’s walled garden will add friction to the process, which means there will be fewer overall dollars being spent through the alternate path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McEMuJ"&gt;But how many fewer? If you lose four out of every ten customers by kicking to an outside payment system, then there’s no point putting it in place — but if it’s only two, you’ll still come out ahead. The specific UX details will make an enormous difference in determining that attrition rate: How large is the button? How many extra taps? Can Safari force you to enter in your credit card number each time you make a new purchase? Each extra step will nudge developers back toward IAP, and make Apple’s App Store profits that much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UoerZF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of the App Store will move to external payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WrL9vF"&gt;Tim Sweeney’s dream in launching this lawsuit was to break Apple’s control over software on iOS. That didn’t happen, and as long as the ruling holds up on appeal, Apple’s control over iOS looks more solid than ever. Under the rules of the injunction, the only way Sweeney can hurt Apple is if developers vote with their feet and leave, taking their commissions with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsbZED"&gt;Apple is particularly dependent on big developers like Epic, which have enough profits to pay 30 percent commission rates and generate the bulk of the App Store’s revenue. Crucially, the court’s injunction isn’t limited to games or in-app payments, so there’s no telling how much of the developer base will leave Apple’s payment system. If that happens, Apple could be forced to switch to give up the commission system for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4h2Rx"&gt;So far, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667047/apple-epic-ruling-games-app-store-fortnite-revenue-purchases-business"&gt;doesn’t look like that’s happening&lt;/a&gt;. The response from most developers has been noncommittal, and some already seem to think it won’t make sense for them to pursue payments outside the Apple system. But with the actual changes still months away (and already under appeal), it makes sense for developers to wait and see whether the new system is worth pursuing. But after the many possibilities opened up on Friday, it seems hard to believe none of them will be interested in exploring their options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secret Facebook program reportedly let celebrities avoid moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fCPqgibTLw3o47GXbf8ly_uAUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851983/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dp95A1"&gt;Facebook maintains a secret program to exempt athletes, politicians, and other high-profile users from its typical moderation process, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program is reportedly meant to stop “PR fires,” or bad press caused by pulling down photos, posts, and other content from high-profile users that should have been allowed to stay up. In reality, the program just lets these users break the rules in ways that would have gotten most people into trouble, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33YOfl"&gt;The program is known as XCheck, or “cross check,” and it’s ostensibly meant to provide additional quality control around moderation when it comes to high-profile users, according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Posts from users flagged for XCheck are supposed to be routed to a set of better-trained moderators to ensure Facebook’s rules are properly enforced. But the program reportedly protected 5.8 million people as of 2020, and just 10 percent of posts that hit XCheck actually get reviewed, according to a document seen by the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HfCMrK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook says it’s “working to address” issues with XCheck&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0JcZ81"&gt;High-profile users protected by the program include former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Candace Owens, according to the report. Users are usually unaware that they’re being given special treatment, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8hjkc"&gt;Facebook told the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;that criticism of XCheck was warranted and the company is working to fix the program. The system is meant to “accurately enforce policies on content that could require more understanding,” a spokesperson said. They added that “Facebook itself identified the issues with cross check and has been working to address them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsDHBF"&gt;While it’s a bad look for Facebook, which has promised even enforcement of its rules, there’s a level on which none of this is particularly surprising. Facebook has a long and detailed set of moderation policies. But it’s always been clear that those policies are enforced at Facebook’s discretion, with leeway often granted to major names or questionable content when removal might lead to problems for the company. With the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report, it’s evident that in some cases, Facebook’s own system, by design or not, is helping keep some of those posts online.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom is adding live translation services and coming to Facebook VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnFVqxSG_OeE5xC2t68V2GPiKJQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851858/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNNwFC"&gt;Zoom plans to expand its support for automatic live transcriptions with the addition of live translation, and turn its whiteboard feature into a more of a fully-featured app, among several other changes the company announced at its Zoomtopia conference on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW8g54"&gt;Automatic live transcriptions / closed captions in English were announced to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;coming to free Zoom accounts in February 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Now Zoom says it “plans to provide real-time transcription for (as many as 30 additional languages) by the end of next year.” As part of that push, Zoom will also offer translation services for paid accounts, with the plan “to support real-time translation across as many as 12 languages by the end of next year.” Zoom wasn’t able to share details about which languages will be supported and when, but did say these improvements are a direct result of the machine learning know-how it gained by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556500/zoom-kites-acquisition-machine-translation-real-time-captions"&gt;acquiring German translation company Kites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yA1u4sf2OYWetoJ8kBl-BmM4fT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841259/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_3.04.04_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom Whiteboard, as accessed through the Zoom app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WEys5R"&gt;The other major change is coming to Zoom’s whiteboard feature. Zoom currently lets you &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard"&gt;create and share whiteboards during meetings&lt;/a&gt; to doodle together while you talk, but a planned expansion launching in beta later this year will make Zoom Whiteboard available outside of meetings in Zoom apps and the web. The basic drawing tools don’t appear to be different from what Zoom currently offers, the main change is how Zoom is treating Whiteboard as a product alongside video calls, rather than a feature that lives inside of them. You’ll be able to add sticky notes, drawings, and comments on your boards and view them whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ukWRl5SX0A6tI1NnHl6D-4AWZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22841323/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_3.29.23_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A meeting in Horizon Workrooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eh51lo"&gt;Early next year, Zoom is coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Facebook’s Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt;. The shared VR meeting space will be able to host video meetings and connect to Zoom Whiteboard, according to Zoom. In VR, you can pin a Zoom Whiteboard to your virtual desk or to the wall for everyone to see, and draw along with colleagues attending a meeting through a traditional computer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Litecoin price jumps 20 percent after hoax links the cryptocurrency and Walmart </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this Photo illustration a Litecoin logo " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZxsYbU3ciXhRx13tKeVtDscYco=/0x4:5000x3337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851585/1234956057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Litecoin spiked Monday after a false press release claimed Walmart would accept the cryptocurrency | Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rn8435"&gt;The Litecoin cryptocurrency saw its price spike by as much as 20 percent on Monday after a fake press release claimed Walmart would begin accepting Litecoin as payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJyULD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/13/2295879/0/en/Walmart-Announces-Major-Partnership-With-Litecoin-LTC.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; posted to GlobeNewswire linked to a non-functioning website, and there was no evidence of any Securities and Exchange Commission filing, which would have been expected since Walmart is publicly traded. Walmart’s official newsroom never included the release, and the company typically uses &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005697/en/Walmart-Launches-Walmart-GoLocal-a-New-Delivery-as-a-Service-Business"&gt;Business Wire&lt;/a&gt; to distribute releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FST50B"&gt;Several news outlets published reports based on the hoax press release, and a short time later &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LTC-USD?p=LTC-USD&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"&gt;Litecoin’s price jumped&lt;/a&gt;, along with those of other cryptocurrencies, before quickly falling back to the previous levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nbuq5b"&gt;It’s not yet clear who may have been behind the hoax press release, but a Walmart spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/13/walmart-to-accept-payments-with-cryptocurrencies-using-litecoin.html"&gt;confirmed to CNBC&lt;/a&gt; that the news announcement was fake. GlobeNewswire and Walmart didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjwmH5"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing new ‘Favorites’ to bring order to your chaotic feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKNcTBubP5QtM-Fi0UGPO_qALP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69842022/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yFl5h3"&gt;You’re on Instagram looking for your best friend’s daily dog update, but you have to scroll endlessly through a sea of posts you care little about, and probably forget what you’re looking for in the first place. After a few extra annoyed scrolls, you close the app in frustration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJ2Yd"&gt;It seems Instagram is well aware of your plight, because it is quietly testing out a solution for your messy feed called “Favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph25cH"&gt;According to Alessandro Paluzzi, a mobile developer who first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;posted about the new feature on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Favorites lets you categorize your most important Instagram accounts (friends and creators) as your priorities, so that their posts will land “higher” in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhrAp6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on "Favorites"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ℹ️ Posts from your favorites are shown higher in feed. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NfBd8v4IHR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NfBd8v4IHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1435919581277609989?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZMmGi"&gt;If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because Instagram was testing a different &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15856858/instagram-favorites-private-sharing-friends-list"&gt;Favorites feature back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which you let you limit the exact audience for each post. For example, you could share your wedding photo with just your designated favorites, rather than with your entire following. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="74JCiE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new feature gives you more control over who you see first in your feed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yc6osZ"&gt;The 2021 iteration of Favorites, however, is about giving you more control over your feed — by telling Instagram which accounts are most important to you. After all, you may follow a bunch of different brands and creators on your account, but you don’t necessarily prioritize their content on the same level as your closest friends and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkjEUC"&gt;Currently, Instagram ranks the order of your feed by the most recent and shared posts from the people you follow, plus other “signals” like how likely you’ll engage with a post, according to the company’s June 2021 &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about its algorithm. While you may “like” many posts you see, those may not be the content you’re actually looking for, but might be sending Instagram all the wrong signals on what you actually want to see in your feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="treq2k"&gt;It’s not clear whether this Favorites feature will become an official feature at all or if it will change before it’s rolled out more broadly. For now, Instagram says it “is an internal prototype that’s still in development, and not testing externally.” Perhaps in the future, you just might see this feature in your account menu, just below &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;“Close Friends”&lt;/a&gt; — a feature that lets you control who you share your Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cvg7r8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 13th, 10:42AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with comment from Instagram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s excellent iPad Pro keyboards are $50 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GisnuiIf0xksBe0mmAhpgxxji2g=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851430/DSC00765.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gaWNh"&gt;You can do more with your iPad Pro by connecting it to a wireless keyboard, especially one that features a trackpad to help you navigate more like a traditional laptop. Brydge’s Pro Plus wireless keyboards with a trackpad for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzEnLHJyqg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are $50 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $170, the model built for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $120. Naturally, the smaller Brydge Pro Plus for the 11-inch iPad Pro costs a bit less. It’s normally $150, but you’ll pay $100 for it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuGfkL"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus is one of a few options available that has a backlit keyboard and a trackpad built in. It connects to your tablet via Bluetooth and recharges via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="53gQmx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbC6iS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Buds Live review: cool beans|76973" data-volume-uuid="2f0898dea" data-volume-id="76973" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-572" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eaNVny"&gt;Also seeing a steep discount today are Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live, the company’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B6Y618?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;At Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can score a set for the lowest price yet. Originally $170, they’re just $105 new today in the color of your choosing. In our review, Chris Welch notes that these stand out with a powerful, yet balanced sound and lengthy battery life. Though, the noise cancellation can’t block out a ton of noise, and they might not be a perfect fit if you have very small ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or watch it above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7Ndwz"&gt;Blue is the only color not available through Amazon, but Best Buy has it &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzETWiLtNU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $120&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Wx2m1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4c510I"&gt;SteelSeries is hosting a member-only 20th anniversary sale on gaming mice, keyboards, headsets, and accessories. If you have an account with the site (making one is free), you can save a considerable amount of money on an upgrade for your PC or console setup. I suggest that you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-sales&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the full list of discounted products here&lt;/a&gt;, but for some hand-picked recommendations, its Aerox 3 Wireless mouse with a lightweight design, waterproofing, and USB-C charging is $70 (usually $100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GyrAnq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdO5Tl"&gt;As for headsets, its Arctis Pro Wireless unfortunately isn’t looped into the anniversary sale, but the wired version is, which is the next best thing. Normally $250, you can get the Arctis Pro plus a GameDAC system included for $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QhwtZ3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNQWSY"&gt;Through Thursday, September 16th at 11AM, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/nioh-the-complete-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nioh: The Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt; is free of charge&lt;/a&gt; on the Epic Games Store. This third-person action game was developed by Team Ninja, known for its excellent and difficult &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;em&gt;Nioh &lt;/em&gt;is no different in terms of difficulty, though it usually gets compared to games like &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; in terms of game mechanics and controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cdIg3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6kBP4B"&gt;Lastly, like SteelSeries, Garmin is also hosting an anniversary sale at its site, discounting several of its wrist-based trackers, as well as other accessories. Of note, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F643260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Venu&lt;/a&gt; is $270 (normally $350), while its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F702902&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high-end Fenix 6 watch&lt;/a&gt; is $450 (normally $550). Check out the rest of the products here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hawkeye’s first trailer introduces the other Hawkeye and some Christmas hijinks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07xpl7Yh_UQDelW43C5Y3glIDMY=/437x0:1943x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851305/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_9.17.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0UuwC"&gt;The first trailer for Disney Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; has arrived, giving a first look at the surprisingly whimsical Christmastime adventures of Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) — and his new successor, Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), who also is running around New York City as a preternaturally skilled, purple-clad archer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS5PM8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; picks up with the titular character after the events of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, which saw Renner’s character flip out into a gothic edgelord style as the murderous vigilante Ronin after his family was wiped from existence in Thanos’ snap. But with things back to normal (and his family restored), Clint just wants to enjoy Christmas with his family: visit New York City, see the new Captain America musical, and enjoy fine dining. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rX9feBatSwn5Lh1mgSZ844MY1Og=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846462/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_9.21.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucky the Pizza Dog!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IiEhYU"&gt;All that seems to get thrown into a loop, though, when word of a vigilante wielding a bow and wearing what looks a lot like Barton’s old Ronin suit starts running around New York. It turns out to be Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop, who proudly tells Hawkeye that &lt;em&gt;she’s&lt;/em&gt; the “world’s greatest archer.” From there, it seems a whole bunch of Christmastime mayhem ensues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1C1ak"&gt;The trailer is particularly notable for its surprisingly light tone: Hawkeye has never been one of the &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;’ more comedic characters, and his previous outing in particular (which again, saw him get a full sleeve tattoo, a tragic haircut, and an international revenge tour) was grim. The new series is expected to draw on the acclaimed Matt Fraction and David Aja comics run (the Tracksuit Mafia and Lucky the Pizza Dog both appear to be in the trailer), which is known for its lighter tone, more grounded stakes, and habit of routinely taking Clint Barton down a peg or two. Although with the Christmas spirit in the air, it also looks like &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; will be taking some pointers from classics like &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLKZ1w"&gt;Hawkeye is set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1139008/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; for a six-episode season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22558074/hawkeye-disney-plus-marvel-november-24th-release-date-announcement"&gt;starting on November 24th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Microsoft’s Surface event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jY_qUbvTjPQay4UnoA-x3sqgtY=/8x0:2392x1589/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851281/twarren_surfacecomparison_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UFfxxR"&gt;Microsoft is holding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651859/microsoft-surface-event-date"&gt;Surface event on September 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, where “the company will talk about devices and Windows 11.” With Windows 11 set to debut on October 5th, we’re expecting to see four new Surface devices showcasing all the latest software features in the new OS. It won’t be all Windows 11, though. Microsoft will also launch a second version of its Surface Duo Android-powered foldable device next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOL469"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface hardware announcements starting at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on September 22nd, and here’s what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QssjzH62OYRWTUFKaGD0FaYJJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329299/twarren_210223_4439_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re expecting a new Surface Pro for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4Nsjmv"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TbRXPE"&gt;The Surface Pro is the main flagship Surface device, and one that has existed since the launch of Windows 8 in 2012. Microsoft is now planning to launch a new Surface Pro 8 ready for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6eDWp"&gt;We’re not expecting any huge design changes on the Surface Pro 8, simply because Microsoft has already made it clear to businesses that it will maintain the Surface port connectivity and overall hardware design to keep it compatible with docks and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIWEu8"&gt;That said, a source familiar with Microsoft’s plans tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is planning to ship a larger display on the Surface Pro 8 with smaller bezels. We also understand Microsoft will move to support Thunderbolt on at least one Surface Pro 8 model. This is the first time Microsoft has supported Thunderbolt on any Surface device, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239517/microsoft-surface-laptops-tablets-thunderbolt-support-security-concerns-comment"&gt;concerns around security&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also planning to drop USB-A ports on at least one Surface Pro 8 model, combined with this Thunderbolt support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oC8Dfk"&gt;Microsoft will also ship its Surface Pro 8 with Intel’s latest 11th Gen chips and support for removable SSDs just like the Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZFVya7"&gt;Surface Book 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6nDRYR"&gt;Microsoft will also debut its big Surface Book design next week. It’s a significant design change that will involve ditching the detachable display in favor of a display that pulls forward to convert between tablet and laptop form factors much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196266/hp-spectre-folio-leather-laptop-convertible-2-in-1-review-specs-price-features"&gt;like the HP Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-book-4"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; these details last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbBWdB"&gt;This new design also allows Microsoft to upgrade the display on the Surface Book 4. We understand Microsoft will opt for a high refresh rate display on the Surface Book 4, possibly up to as high as 120Hz to support a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555295/microsoft-windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-laptops"&gt;new Windows 11 Dynamic Refresh Rate feature&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow the Surface Book 4 to include smooth scrolling, and then switch down to standard 60Hz modes to save battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ERXqk"&gt;This dynamic refresh rate will also help improve inking on the Surface Book 4, as inking will switch to high refresh rates. Microsoft is also improving the Surface Pen that works with the Surface Book 4 to include haptic feedback. It will also snap to the side of the Book 4 and support charging when it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft will have a new Surface Pro X ready for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ripPRi"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EUAG1U"&gt;Microsoft is also expected to launch a new Surface Pro X model next week. While there won’t be any major design changes, we’re expecting a chip upgrade inside and possibly even a high refresh rate display. We’ve heard Microsoft has been testing high refresh rate displays on the Surface Pro or Surface Pro X line, and we’ll find out next week if Microsoft has managed to upgrade its displays on the Surface Pro lineups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JxET4i"&gt;Surface Go 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp3ry8"&gt;The final Windows-powered Surface device we’re expecting next week is the Surface Go 3. This smaller Surface will maintain the same smaller footprint design but with a big upgrade inside. We’re told at least one model will ship with Intel’s Core i3 processor, offering better performance for this smaller Surface than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;existing Pentium Gold processor models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtHemv"&gt;We’re also hoping to see Microsoft move away from models with 4GB of RAM and the slower eMMC storage on base models. The Surface Go 3 looks like a modest upgrade in time for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1LoMx"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ps7dME"&gt;Microsoft also looks set to debut its next Surface phone. The successor to the Surface Duo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;already leaked online&lt;/a&gt;, offering an early glimpse at what to expect. The biggest hardware upgrade will be a triple-camera system that includes ultrawide, telephoto, and standard camera lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R3GVd"&gt;The triple-camera system will add a camera bump to the rear of the device, as seen in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;leaked photos earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The Surface Duo 2 should also ship with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 processor, with 5G support and an NFC reader, both of which were missing from the first generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QklcUP"&gt;Microsoft is also making some other minor changes to the hardware on the Surface Duo 2, including moving its fingerprint reader into the power button on the Duo 2 and centering the USB-C port on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKaBs0"&gt;The real questions around the Surface Duo 2 will be its software changes. The original Surface Duo has struggled with its software support for dual displays, and the successor is expected to ship with Android 11. This should help with some dual-screen support, but Microsoft will also have to offer far better software support to make the Surface Duo 2 successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ql4YB1"&gt;
&lt;p id="m1yMwf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface hardware announcements on September 22nd. The event kicks off at 11AM ET / 8AM PT, so stay tuned for all the latest Surface news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BuddyPhones Cosmos Plus are full-featured travel headphones for kids</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Bluetooth, noise cancellation, volume limiting — these kids’ headphones have it all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pzaVj1"&gt;In my home, headphones for my kids tend to be a hand-me-down affair. When I’ve upgraded to something newer or better, I pass down my old cans to my kids to use with their tablets or Chromebooks. But this is less than ideal for a variety of reasons: the older headphones might be lacking features like Bluetooth or noise cancellation; what fits my oversized head likely won’t sit comfortably on their kid-sized domes; and standard headphones don’t have a way to limit their maximum volume, which can lead to hearing loss in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvJLhv"&gt;That’s where the BuddyPhones Cosmos Plus come in. The $99.99 Cosmos Plus check off every feature you might want in a pair of kids’ headphones. Bluetooth? Yup. Noise cancellation? You got it. Volume limiting? Three different levels, as a matter of fact. Kid-friendly aesthetics and size? Yes and yes. They come in six different colors with cartoon graphics on the ear cups and have a color-matched hard case, USB-C charging cable, 3.5mm cable, and boom mic all in the box. Though some parents may balk at spending $100 on headphones for their kids, you can’t deny that there’s a lot of value packed in the Cosmos Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Sxoden"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10748998"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwqA5UvHjUwvWao_UIjC3gWbp5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844890/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus come with a color-matched hard case, charging cable, audio cable, and boom mic in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBpoOO"&gt;The Cosmos Plus have a colorful, all-plastic design, with a padded headband and plush ear cups. Their 227-gram weight makes it easy for smaller heads to wear them without getting tired, and they have a wide range of size adjustment, from small enough to fit on a five-year-old’s head to big enough to stretch over my larger-than-average adult-sized cranium. Though these won’t compare to higher-end wireless headphones in terms of materials and build quality, they are sturdy and flexible and don’t feel like they will break immediately. The included hard case helps ensure they won’t break when tossed in a bag or not being used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqtmLZ"&gt;The outside of the ear cups have cartoon graphics — a fairy princess and rainbow unicorn on the models I tested, with a lion, cartoon DJ, scientist, and pirate on the other color options — and you can get them in pink, white, yellow, gray, blue, or dark blue depending on your child’s preference. There’s no mistaking the fact that these were designed with kids in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4HJeKCYWn3IohffuspSK1HRj-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844899/BuddyPhones_Cosmos__combined_all_colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Onanoff&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus come in six different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YlI2ZF"&gt;I was able to test the Cosmos Plus for a few weeks with my own six-year-old and nine-year-old. We used them at home during their allotted screentime and during two long road trips. For the most part, my kids liked the headphones — there were no complaints of discomfort or inability to hear their videos or games, and they both liked the cartoon designs on the ear cups. My spouse and I appreciated the silence in the car as we crossed hundreds of miles without any bickering or arguing between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JAF4h"&gt;As for the audio specs, the Cosmos Plus have 40mm neodymium drivers, similar to many other over-ear Bluetooth headphones. The sound quality isn’t going to remotely compete with the best from Apple or Sony — there is bass, but it’s not especially pronounced, and instruments can get lost in the mix easily — but it’s average for this price point and just fine for the music or content kids might use them with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDHwWN"&gt;More importantly, the Cosmos Plus have three levels of volume limiting: 75dbA, 85dbA, and 94dbA. The default mode is the 85dbA setting, which BuddyPhones identifies as the “kids mode.” The lowest setting is meant for the extra-sensitive ears of toddlers (BuddyPhones recommends the Cosmos Plus for ages three and up), while the highest setting is dubbed “travel mode” and is designed to overcome the noise of an airplane engine. Sounds above 85dbA are &lt;a href="https://www.mottchildren.org/health-library/tf4173"&gt;considered harmful and should be limited as much as possible&lt;/a&gt;, according to hearing experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJy7X5"&gt;All three levels of volume limiting are available when the headphones are used in Bluetooth mode, while the wired mode is set to the 85dbA limit. Changing the mode requires holding volume up and volume down buttons together for two seconds, which will cycle the headphones through the various modes. It’s relatively simple for parents to change but not obvious for kids to do on their own. Though I don’t have the gear to validate BuddyPhones’ specific decibel claims for each level, there is a noticeable difference with how loud each setting allows the headphones to be and the middle setting is certainly lower than the max volume my own headphones reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WZTAVIV477JlWtnKOKdiZu-wnOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844892/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The right ear cup has the power / pairing button and volume up and down, plus the USB-C charging port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeYPU0rkNei3itjCASpPlc_J0y8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844891/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left ear cup is a switch to turn on Study Mode, as well as a button to enable the active noise cancellation, which works in both wired and wireless modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KlB87z"&gt;Further aiding the volume limiting feature is the Cosmos Plus active noise cancellation, which can be used in either wired or wireless modes. A button on the left ear cup turns the ANC on or off, with a green light indicating it’s on. The noise cancellation won’t silence the world in the way the best noise canceling headphones on the market can, but it is effective enough to help reduce low frequency sounds like a constant fan, road noise, or the drone of an airplane cabin. Having noise cancellation is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/are-your-kids-headphones-permanently-damaging-their-hearing#How-can-parents-help-protect-young-ears?"&gt;generally recommended for kids&lt;/a&gt;, since it allows them to hear their music or video easier without having to turn up the volume more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTwGy2"&gt;The Cosmos Plus also have a “Study Mode,” which is activated by a switch on the left ear cup. The company says this boosts the midrange and “lowers down part of the audio spectrum which is not on the voice human spectrum and can impact audibility of a voice.” It’s also designed to make it easier to hear voices when on video calls. The Cosmos Plus have microphones on the ear cup and the detachable boom mic that can be used instead. But neither are particularly great — I tested the Cosmos Plus on a day of Zoom calls for work and had mixed results. My colleagues said the boom mic caused my voice to clip, producing a crackling sound, while the ear cup mic had a noticeable echo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Caub5TEqr-KWD1R1W7KqN9cJDeg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844893/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included boom mic plugs into the USB-C port, but it still doesn’t provide the best voice quality for calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4UaoI1"&gt;Lastly, the Cosmos Plus have the ability to share their audio with another set of wired headphones, simply by plugging them into the 3.5mm headphone jack on the left ear cup. This is a convenient feature when two kids are watching the same movie on a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rCqlz"&gt;But despite the long list of features, there is room for improvement, particularly in how the Cosmos Plus are powered on and off. Instead of a switch to go from off to on to pairing mode, the Cosmos Plus rely on long-pressing a single button located between the volume buttons. A one-second press will turn the headphones on and flash a blue light; do the same when they are on and the light will flash red and turn the headphones off. But if you hold that button down for a second or two too long and miss the first light flash, the Cosmos Plus will go into their pairing mode and you have to release the button and hold it down again for five seconds before they fully shut off and you can start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUK6AFG0mnfTtAdLi-Meg6Spw50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844895/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus are light enough and small enough for kids to wear for hours at a time without discomfort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1RnCTR_nqlfB58w-3U3tFGIajk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844897/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even older kids can appreciate the Cosmos Plus’ set of features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WV91Lv"&gt;This made it difficult for the kids to turn the headphones on and off themselves — nearly every time they wanted to use them my spouse or I would have to handle turning them on and making sure they connected to their tablets correctly. If they didn’t turn the headphones off properly when they were done, they risked running the battery down unnecessarily in the case. Though I appreciate the button controls over the touch swiping that a lot of modern Bluetooth headphones use, the power button should really be a switch instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEvGPS"&gt;Additionally, while it’s nice to have the noise cancellation separate from the Bluetooth controls, allowing it to work both wired and wirelessly, it also meant that sometimes the kids would remember to turn it on and sometimes they wouldn’t. They would also forget to turn off the ANC when they put the headphones away, since the button is separate from the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBfS2"&gt;As for battery life, BuddyPhones claims up to 24 hours between charges. I don’t think they lasted quite that long in our testing, but they do last long enough that we only have to charge them once a week or so at home. They also lasted through an 11-hour car ride with plenty of juice to spare, though they were not being used the entire time. Charging is done through the USB-C port and takes a couple of hours to top them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYO1yt"&gt;In all, there’s little to complain about with the Cosmos Plus. They have a wide set of features, including the important things like volume limiting and noise cancellation; come in a bunch of colors kids like; and have all the necessary accessories in the box. Though the power button situation can certainly be improved and the microphones aren’t as good as more expensive headphones, the Cosmos Plus are an ideal travel headphone for kids and certainly better than my old hand-me-downs.&lt;/p&gt;
