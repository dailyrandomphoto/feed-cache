  &lt;p id="iaMPZI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 26th, 2021 12:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303165/sony-playstation-5-ps5-digital-edition-best-buy-restock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; currently has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733405666949444883" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733405679402492025" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 digital editions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in stock. You can find more information on the retailer's restock &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303165/sony-playstation-5-ps5-digital-edition-best-buy-restock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPqddq"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is available now. Due to the pandemic and high demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550842/sony-playstation-5-ps5-launch-day-in-store-purchases"&gt;retailers such as Best Buy and Target will only sell the console online&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. So, if you were planning to camp outside your local Target hoping to buy the console today, there will be no walk-in purchases available this year. But, you can order one online and request an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7M35PW"&gt;If you are torn between which PS5 console to buy, no need to worry. The biggest difference to note is that the PS5 Digital Edition is smaller than the PS5 standard, costs $399, and it does not include a Blu-ray disc drive. The PS5 standard is $100 more, is a bit bulkier than the digital edition, and includes a disc drive, allowing you to play game discs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 is back in stock at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcv6_nbCnmXLGMpyuKUVJu9atxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880681/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjxoNx"&gt;Sony’s latest gaming console, the PS5, is one of many gaming gadgets that are pretty hard to find in stock right now due to mostly online-only sales. If you are trying to get your hands on one, Best Buy has restocked the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733405666949444883" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733405679402492025" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 digital edition&lt;/a&gt; right now, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eanvXa"&gt;Similar to today’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22303116/xbox-series-x-s-restock"&gt;Xbox Series X / Series S restocks&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer is releasing small waves of PS5 stock right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;After you secure your PS5, you should consider picking up a few items that will help you get the most out of your next-gen console. I strongly suggest buying &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; and purchasing &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;. A one-year membership to PS Plus also gives you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital compilation featuring popular games released on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6eSnW"&gt;If you want to expand your SSD storage, sadly there is no way to do that just yet. But Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As WandaVision nears its end, episode 8 looks through the past</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6M3KazKZjjc7ZxYhinJUlwWUFf8=/271x0:1714x962/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880625/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_10.59.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xX5r56"&gt;The path to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267989/wandavision-5th-episode-recap-sitcom-horror-disney-plus-streaming-crossover-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;hasn’t been an easy one for Kevin Feige and the Marvel Studios team. Well, at least the path to Wanda Maximoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXPGFI"&gt;Wanda Maximoff, one of the most powerful characters both in the MCU and the comics, found herself the child of divorced parents. There was &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt; on one side that wanted to use the character in its Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and 20th Century Fox on the other that technically owned her rights. Marvel’s team found a way to make the character work, but something always felt off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUIwQI"&gt;Following Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;acquisition of 21st Century Fox&lt;/a&gt;, and everything becoming one giant family, things have changed — and so much of how this can benefit the MCU became clear in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s penultimate episode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL3Tbq"&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;We’re seven weeks and eight episodes into this, friends. You know what’s about to happen. Don’t want to be spoiled? Stop reading here.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f0CHJx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A portrait of grief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lOjCFn"&gt;It almost feels stupid to talk about theories of what’s to come. This episode was the most poignant, beautiful breakdown of the unbelievable grief Wanda Maximoff has experienced throughout her life. Agatha, who was introduced at the end of last week’s episode as the witch masquerading as Wanda’s neighbor Agnes, brings Wanda on a journey through the past using a series of portals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSCND2"&gt;We see as Wanda watched her parents die by the hands of a Stark Industries missile in Sokovia, while trapped under the bed with her twin brother Pietro, the only family she had left. It then moves to the Hydra facility where Wanda and Pietro volunteered for the organization. Her powers, seemingly present from when she was a young child, allow her to touch the mind stone trapped within the scepter seen with Loki in &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt; without immediately dying. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNhrWgLKLUjb6wmcX-rDXYVBOfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330956/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.15.22_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rUWR8k"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;post-&lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron &lt;/em&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, Wanda is once again dealing with more grief after Pietro was gunned down in Sokovia after trying to help the Avengers. In one heartbreaking scene, where Vision is trying to help Wanda through the grieving process, we’re treated to an intimate conversation between the two, wherein Vision tells Wanda, “What is grief if not love persevering?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3DoKl"&gt;The final bit of Wanda’s memory focuses on Wanda trying to get Vision’s body back after &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, she walks in on Director Hayward and his S.W.O.R.D. team dismantling Vision’s body, after he’s declared the “most dangerous sentient weapon ever made.” It’s all too much for Wanda, who drives to the empty lot where Vision purchased a deed for their home “to grow old in.” Wanda’s grief finally reaches a breaking point, causing her magic to explode, taking over the town of WestView and introducing the fictional reality she’s in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbU0jx"&gt;So much of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;thus far has focused on Wanda’s grief presenting itself in small ways. Her grief is spoken about — by Darcy, Monica, Pietro, and even Vision — but Wanda rarely showed it. The penultimate episode finally allowed it to take center stage. It’s vital for the finale for audiences to truly understand how desperate and full of grief Wanda is, to properly set up whatever is going to happen next, and this episode finally allowed us to do so. It’s a beautiful episode of television and, if they can stick the landing, it may make &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; one of my favorite pieces of the MCU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C5m79B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome, Scarlet Witch &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p5w7m3"&gt;That said, there are some things to explore a little further, starting with a beautiful retcon of a retcon... kind of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilP0gM"&gt;When Marvel Studios first introduced Wanda and Pietro, there were a couple of rules. They couldn’t use the word mutant (that’s why both were referred to as enhanced beings), and since they couldn’t exist as Magneto’s children (that’s Fox territory), they were retconned, including in the comics &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/26/22302817/wandavision-scarlet-witch-powers-chaos-magic"&gt;leading up to &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;’s release&lt;/a&gt;. It was always a sore point for Marvel fans, but the community understood the licensing battles were complicated. Post-Fox acquisition, everything changed, and the end of this &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;episode finally introduced Wanda as the Scarlet Witch. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TBFotij2AB1Lvm1a3jk_GJNJvms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330964/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.16.44_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2jRJ7h"&gt;Wanda and Pietro’s powers were retconned within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as something that was enhanced by Hydra. Neither realized they had any special abilities, but genetic testing conducted in part using the scepter unlocked extraordinary abilities in both of them. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;takes it one step further, allowing Agatha to point out to Wanda that she apparently had abilities inside her since birth that she was using even as a child. For example, when Wanda and Pietro’s home exploded after a Stark missile went off, and they were stuck under the bed, Agatha remarked that Wanda was likely using a probability hex to ensure they remained safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGpodg"&gt;In the comics, Wanda’s powers allow her to control probability via her hexes — the same word for her powers is also the shape of the fictional city she’s made for herself, yes. As long as whatever she was trying to control was in her line of sight, Wanda could control the probability of what would happen. In the episode, when Wanda is staring at the non-detonated Stark missile that landed in her living room, it’s simply a case of “good luck” created by Wanda that stopped it from ever going off. At least, that’s what happened according to Agatha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="677ZAd"&gt;Wanda’s powers are increasingly important for one theory that’s floated around for a while — &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;isn’t setting up Mephisto, the Marvel devil that has become the most popular theory for the big bad reveal in the finale, but Dormammu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="49R4Ow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dormam-who?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7c5WFb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange &lt;/em&gt;fans will recognize the name Dormammu as the metaphysical villain that Strange had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13447594/doctor-strange-review-marvel-benedict-cumberbatch"&gt;defeat in his film back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meDuOQ"&gt;Well, Dormammu also has a pretty special connection to Wanda Maximoff. She, alongside a number of Avengers and Defenders, came together to try to stop Dormammu from putting together the pieces of an ancient artifact known as the Evil Eye, which would allow Earth to be brought into a dark dimension. Who does Dormammu enlist to help achieve this goal? Everyone’s favorite god of mischief, Loki, whose story is about to continue in his own series this June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30QnUP"&gt;The theory found new ground thanks to the color of Agatha’s magic. It’s not red or orange like Wanda’s and Doctor Strange’s: it’s purple. That’s the same color as Dormammu. It’s not exactly like magic is color-coded in the MCU (although it might be going forward), but if Agatha and Dormammu are representations of evil — despite Agatha being a mentor to Wanda in the comics — using a certain color of magic to display their evilness could be one method.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tmg420e-NmYa5xIKLtdDVGawV70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330966/dormammu.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s636IS"&gt;Now, look — Dormammu seems like a bit of a stretch. The last time we saw the nefarious being, they had signed a pact with Strange to never return to Earth and we really haven’t heard anything since. At the same time, we do know that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;leads into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21059975/doctor-strange-scott-derrickson-multiverse-madness-disney-plus-marvel-loki-wandavision"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and messing around with evil villains from different worlds certainly seems to be where Phase 4 of the MCU is headed between &lt;em&gt;Multiverse of Madness &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Eternals&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47ijop"&gt;Dormammu is also, quite literally, at one point the Lord of Chaos. Agatha revealed to Wanda this week that she wields chaos magic. It’s an incredibly rare form of magic and makes her more powerful than anyone realized. This is also why people believe she’ll be revealed as a Nexus being, an anchor within the multiverse whose existence is key to Doctor Strange. She’s crucial in maintaining the stability of all mankind on Earth. As my &lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;colleague Susana Polo wrote about the history of Wanda’s chaos magic in the comics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pcWMG3"&gt;Eventually, other writers gave Wanda’s brand of magic a specific source: The God-of-Chaos-turned-ancient-demon-turned-Lovecraft-style -creepy-force-of-darkness-locked-away-in-an-alternate-dimension Chthon. Chthon’s place of power was Mount Wundagore, a fictional place in Eastern Europe where Wanda just happened to have been born. That’s probably not going to make it into &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, but it does put Wanda among the Marvel Universe’s foremost wielders of Chaos Magic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kStShy"&gt;Just as unlikely as Chthon being introduced into the MCU via &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is Dormammu, quite honestly. There are too many questions about other characters and plotlines set up, including Billy and Tommy, Wanda’s kids. They have a closer connection to Agatha and Mephisto, and how much is &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;supposed to set up for an entire phase? It feels like a lot to cram into one final episode! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF9Sri"&gt;So, let’s focus on the one character we know will play out next episode and examine just how heartbreaking it’s likely going to be — White Vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lj1bTn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is White Vision? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="12mPCx"&gt;Everyone knows who Vision is, but in the comics, there’s a version of the character that actually was used as a sentient weapon — and he lost everything that made him the lovable synthezoid in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KuzHylVmnBYI-3ITQpYhXUryTrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330969/Screen_Shot_2021_02_26_at_11.18.21_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3aj9xq"&gt;White Vision entered the comics in 1989 as part of John Byrne’s &lt;em&gt;Vision Quest&lt;/em&gt; series from a West Coast Avengers run. The run found Vision’s body being dismantled by a government group. Once his body was dismantled, he lost the color in his skin. Although Hank Pym figured out a way to revive Vision, he remained a ghost white version of himself. More importantly, reviving Vision meant that the synthezoid also lost connection to Wanda and their sons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrXwqF"&gt;In the MCU, Vision’s colorless body is also a reference to his death post-Thanos. There’s already a logical explanation for why Vision would look white, but the post-credits scene acknowledges that White Vision is created using the same energy that Wanda is using to keep her fictional town going. He’s only resurrected through her chaos magic, and it’s likely only her chaos magic that can destroy him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g5pF8RpDH0uA2yxbF6wDVPvNkGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330979/whitevision1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of White Vision.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tBezrLIEduX9OiLvzLTQKitA9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22330982/whitevision2.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pUHCRf"&gt;The post-credits scene in this week’s &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;sets up a finale where Wanda might have to fight White Vision. It’s a little poetic, and absolutely heartbreaking. In order to protect her family, she has to acknowledge that Vision is actually dead and defeat him in the process. I assume she’ll have a little help from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;Monica Rambeau’s Spectrum (perhaps!)&lt;/a&gt; along the way, perhaps, but that brings up another important question: what happened to Monica? We didn’t see her at all in this episode, but we know she was found by Pietro after trying to help Wanda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA6vpC"&gt;Everything will finally be answered next week as &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;comes to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy has stock available for the Xbox Series X and S right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SQNYsH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 26th, 2021 12:05PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy still has both consoles in stock, but the retailer is releasing small waves of inventory every few minutes, so if you’re unable to buy one immediately, it’s worth trying again in a few minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF9r2H"&gt;Best Buy has restocked both of Microsoft’s next-gen consoles the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733401816553757879" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733401816553757879" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt;. Like some other gaming gadgets released late last year, these consoles are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt; to buy, but if you move quickly, you have another chance to buy one right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpQOHY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cfRAwj"&gt;Whether you buy the digital-only Series S or the more powerful Xbox Series X which includes a disc drive, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4Zgyt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gpa4v9"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SE84Lx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Watch 2020’s hurricane season unfold in a mesmerizing four-minute timelapse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-PK7trOXmYal2C8cQz5OHUINGc=/0x0:996x664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880581/Feb_26_2021_11_37_59.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfdGiS"&gt;This week, NASA released a grim four-minute timelapse of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, a mesmerizing display of last year’s record-breaking string of tropical commotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B5CY5"&gt;2020’s season “smashed records with an unprecedented 30 named storms, marking the fifth year in a row with above-average hurricane activity,” NASA said in a blog accompanying the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rTj5z"&gt;The agency’s &lt;a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4884#30824"&gt;Scientific Visualization Studio&lt;/a&gt; used a complex &lt;a href="https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/document_files/IMERG_ATBD_V5.2_0.pdf"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to process and merge hordes of data from an array of weather satellites in orbit, combining it with estimates and observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center and National Hurricane Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9PsRc"&gt;The product is a fascinating four-minute and 26-second look at last year’s hurricane activity, unfolding in a colorful display of wispy cyclone formations tumbling across the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eL0XGE"&gt;“The bar has been raised,” Brian McNoldy, a senior researcher at the University of Miami’s Marine and Atmospheric Science school, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BMcNoldy/status/1362500180797501450?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; last week. “When we mention the average number of named storms, hurricanes, &amp;amp; major hurricanes, we’re typically referring to a recent 30-year ‘climate normal’. We’ve been using 1981-2010, but now we have 1991-2020, and the counts have increased by 12-19%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H90zxR"&gt;The total cost of 2020’s climate events was $95 billion, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events/US/2020"&gt;data from NOAA&lt;/a&gt;, killing 262 people. There were 13 severe storms, seven tropical cyclones, one drought, and one wildfire event, according to NOAA. Last year’s Atlantic hurricane season was the fifth costliest on record, causing roughly $60 billion in economic damage, according to &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/record-breaking-2020-hurricane-season-caused-60-billion-to-65-billion-in-economic-damage/858788"&gt;a report from AccuWeather&lt;/a&gt;. The most expensive season on record was in 2017, hitting $306.2 billion in costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9o544E"&gt;“Climate normals are updated each decade to keep up with a changing climate,” McNoldy said. “What was normal 50 years ago isn’t normal now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TPQrR"&gt;The Atlantic hurricane season officially starts each year on June 1st and ends on November 30th, though storms can — and do — occur outside of the official season. June 1st, 2021, is less than 100 days away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Batman’s next comic series is a Fortnite crossover</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1SABrUWP49ozACTO26R3UoGeWow=/0x1320:3089x3379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880577/BMFNZP_Cv1_VAR_FINAL_VARIANT_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpYOJa"&gt;DC Comics and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games are joining forces on a new Batman and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite-&lt;/em&gt;themed crossover comic book. The six-issue miniseries, titled &lt;em&gt;Batman / Fortnite: Zero Point&lt;/em&gt;, will debut on April 20th. Two issues will then launch in both May and June before the series concludes with a final issue on July 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPduQo"&gt;Longtime &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans might have perked up at the mention of the Zero Point, a reality-warping ball of energy that is hovering over the middle of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island and is the catalyst for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;this season’s many brand crossovers&lt;/a&gt;. (Just yesterday, Ellen Ripley and the Xenomorph from the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; series &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1365089650126290950"&gt;were added to the game&lt;/a&gt;.) It seems the Zero Point will play a key role in this comic miniseries, &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/02/26/batman-enters-the-world-of-fortnite-in-a-new-miniseries-this-april"&gt;according to this plot summary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WH2S0Q"&gt;A crack splits the sky above Gotham City... a tear in reality itself. This rift pulls the Dark Knight into a bizarre and unfamiliar world, with no memory of who he is or where he came from...Batman has been drawn into Fortnite! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQMUeq"&gt;As he fights to recall his past and escape an endless loop of chaos and struggle, he’ll come face-to-face with the likes of Renegade Raider, Fishstick, Bandolier, and more. While the world’s greatest detective strives to make sense of this strange new world, he’ll uncover the shocking truth about the Island, what lies beyond the Loop, and how everything is connected to the mysterious Zero Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XGRnVN"&gt;Print issues will have codes for DC-themed in-game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; items inspired by the comic, and US subscribers to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238924/dc-universe-infinite-comics-app-subscription-relaunch"&gt;DC Universe Infinite app&lt;/a&gt; will get the full series and codes for the in-game items for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNrW1c"&gt;This won’t be Batman’s first crossover with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt; He and Catwoman were added as skins alongside a playable Gotham City area &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/batman-glides-to-fortnite-on-batman-day"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic has since added skins for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21125280/fortnite-harley-quinn-skin-birds-of-prey-crossover"&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stop-the-presses-the-last-laugh-bundle-brings-the-joker-poison-ivy-and-more-to-fortnite"&gt;the Joker, and Poison Ivy&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djktms"&gt;And it’s also not &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s first comic crossover — Epic has created many Marvel skins for the popular battle royale, and the game’s last season, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;which was Marvel-themed&lt;/a&gt;, kicked off with an in-game comic. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 26th, 2021 11:26AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has stock available for both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733401816553757879" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733401765209809605" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22303116/xbox-series-x-s-restock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08H75RTZ8%2Fref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26linkCode%3Dsl2%26tag%3Dverge-evergreen-20%26linkId%3De8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578%26language%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores.

    <title>Shadow and Bone’s first trailer teases Netflix’s next big hit </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1up0qydWVWRFJ3viRcJWO5ke-0=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880192/shadow_bone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rbjbXp"&gt;Netflix is constantly looking for its next big franchise hit — a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/stranger-things"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;And the trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.theyoungfolks.com/books/150906/netflix-shadow-and-bone-grishaverse-characters-explained/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;teases that the upcoming fantasy series could be next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rklqUJ"&gt;The first trailer for Netflix’s adaptation of the series showcases the series’ main protagonist, Alina, a map maker who discovers that she harbors a special power that can prevent the world from being swallowed up in darkness threatened by a terrifying sea-of-sorts called the Fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG7Ehg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone &lt;/em&gt;is Leigh Bardugo’s fantasy series that has swept readers by storm. The book, which introduces readers to the Grisha universe — a world inhabited by special people who practice a form of spell work known as small sciences — has become immensely popular on sites like Tumblr and TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWN3ch"&gt;Fantasy, especially series that focus on teenage and young adult characters, is a genre that every network and streamer is trying to dominate. Whether it’s a &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson &lt;/em&gt;series on Disney Plus or &lt;em&gt;His Dark Materials &lt;/em&gt;on HBO, figuring out what the next big fantasy obsession is in a post-&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;world has become a race. It makes sense; shows like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;are immensely popular, and fantasy worlds allow studios and networks to create full-fledged franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdIAFo"&gt;For example, the Grisha universe was originally made up of a trilogy — &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Siege and Storm&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ruin and Rising &lt;/em&gt;— but was followed up by the &lt;em&gt;Crooked Kingdom &lt;/em&gt;series, which included the popular &lt;em&gt;Six of Crows&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone &lt;/em&gt;takes off for Netflix, there are several more books for the streamer to mine for potential spinoffs of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iExjM"&gt;For now, fans will at least be able to tune into &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone &lt;/em&gt;to watch the adventures of Alina, Mal, and the Darkling. &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone &lt;/em&gt;will premiere on April 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch three minutes of New Pokémon Snap gameplay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yKnWjjihFouz25rXFO4APrG8nfA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880047/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_screen_01.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wGMKT5"&gt;During today’s Pokémon Presents presentation&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;the company unveiled new gameplay footage for &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294077/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-new-n64"&gt;long-awaited sequel&lt;/a&gt; to the N64 classic. The new footage showed off the lush and colorful settings that you will explore across the Lental region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkQmrM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;will have players assuming the role of a pokémon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;photographer who will collaborate with the region’s pokémon expert, Professor Mirror, and his assistant Rita to observe pokémon in their natural habitats. Gameplay remains similar to its predecessor but introduces some new mechanics, such as a photo-sharing feature that will allow you to share your photos online, plus a ranking system so you can compete with other players across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhMPM1"&gt;The new footage is just one of many announcements presented. The Pokémon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Company also announced it was working on a few projects focused on the fourth generation of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;titles, this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;remakes for the original DS titles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;: an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;open-world RPG set in the Sinnoh region&lt;/a&gt; that takes place long before the other &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omcZWq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230643/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;release on April 30th&lt;/a&gt; exclusively on Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What will changing Section 230 mean for the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fyxJEPR5QSlfGsiXkpeezHabhjk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68880015/VRG_ILLO_4450__002.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A virtual symposium on the internet’s most important law&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5vBku1"&gt;Section 230, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;turned 25 years old this month&lt;/a&gt;, has played a central role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;shaping the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past year, Congress has introduced several proposals to change the law — some of them drastic — but the bills have often focused on a handful of very large tech companies like Facebook and Google. In reality, Section 230 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview"&gt;created a lot of the web as we know it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="JsLnTB"&gt;On Monday, March 1st, we’re &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/thevergelive/thevergearticle"&gt;holding an event&lt;/a&gt; on Section 230 and the future of tech regulation. After a keynote from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), I’ll be sitting down with Wikimedia Foundation general counsel Amanda Keton, Vimeo general counsel Michael Cheah, and writer and strategist Sydette Harry to discuss how changing Section 230 could change the web. For a broader sense of its impact, however, I also spoke to a range of companies, nonprofits, legal experts, and others with a stake in preserving or reforming the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oVMtpq"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R4fYwk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laurent Crenshaw, head of policy at Patreon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ulUIBO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patreon is an online funding platform for artists, musicians, streamers, and other creatives. Founded in 2013, it supports over 200,000 creators with more than 6 million patrons. Its users include podcaster Joe Budden, musician Amanda Palmer, and news host Philip DeFranco.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5zUKTM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10347701"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MM6Pjc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Section 230 impact Patreon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npmI3i"&gt;Section 230 matters to Patreon every single day because we are a platform that has hundreds of thousands of creators, that has millions of patrons that are communicating with each other and the creators, and creators that are creating new works on a daily basis. If we had to proactively take steps to identify and monitor, validate, and verify that content prior to posting, it would be incredibly difficult for that platform to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQdC1V"&gt;Even little tweaks, like when they talk about removing language around “otherwise objectionable” content, which really is what gives platforms the ability to have their own moderation guidelines — it’s just incredibly concerning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpGhtp"&gt;Because otherwise, we’re talking about a scenario where platforms are encouraged to not have any type of content moderation, while at the same time still potentially facing liability, or to have much more litigation directed at them without the protection that Section 230 provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuFWlS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s say Section 230 gets repealed completely. What would the next year look like for Patreon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2pwoH"&gt;We would do everything within our power to continue to be a platform that funds creators. But at the same time, I think we would have to reassess how we go about deciding who we can fund through the platform, if suddenly we have to consider whether or not we’ll be liable for any content we’re directly funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8wDer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about more moderate options in bills like the PACT Act, which would do things like require publishing transparent moderation guidelines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yL4sGC"&gt;Transparency reports are not the most controversial thing in the world. It’s something that we’re looking at doing in the future as well. Some of the items that are being proposed, like call centers, I think sound better on paper than necessarily in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLZ4eD"&gt;But at the end of the day, I think that honestly, any lawmaker proposals that are being considered need to make sure that they aren’t basically solving problems that are targeted towards larger companies, and at the same time, that they don’t throw the baby out bathwater in regards to creating a whole new sort of regulatory model — an approach that is overly burdensome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jnmk9r"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aDHjZS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrie Goldberg, author and victims’ rights attorney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="X3MEwN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrie Goldberg represents victims of online harassment, stalking, blackmail, and other crimes. She is the author of &lt;/em&gt;Nobody’s Victim: Fighting Psychos, Stalkers, Pervs, and Trolls&lt;em&gt;, and she represented Grindr user Matthew Herrick in a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tylerkingkade/grindr-herrick-lawsuit-230-online-stalking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;high-profile lawsuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that was ultimately dismissed on Section 230 grounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3Xel8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the core effect that you see Section 230 having online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKGyvA"&gt;It emboldens platforms to give zero fucks about users. Since users can’t hold platforms liable for harms caused, platforms have no incentive to invest in design and operations to reduce or mitigate injuries. And I’m not talking about harms like being called a bitch on Twitter. I’m talking about child abuse victims’ rapes being on porn sites, 1,200 men arriving at your home for a gangbang because somebody is impersonating you on Grindr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7FDYey"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you harm your users, you should be sued, no matter how big or small.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ydsyB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be your proposed changes to the law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R80FI"&gt;First choice is to completely abolish Section 230. Our current civil legal system already has barriers to entry to prevent frivolous suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct6JqQ"&gt;Second choice is eliminate the immunity for platforms that are solely in the business of being malicious, instances where a platform is put on notice of a harming user, and all causes of action alleging unlawful activity on platforms — especially dissemination of child sexual abuse material, child sexual exploitation, revenge porn, deepfakes, stalking, known rapists and abusers using dating apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxyuuT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of some of the more common proposed changes to Section 230, like Facebook’s suggestion that sites should be required to release transparency reports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRpcXQ"&gt;Facebook’s suggestion that it be required to release transparency reports is not a change to Section 230. Obviously, any proposal set forth by a platform should be regarded with side-eye. I want to throw up any time somebody suggests transparency as a fix. Transparency means nothing if nobody has the right to do anything about all the atrocities these companies are being transparent about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3WO4F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the criticisms of Section 230 reforms is that sites like Facebook can afford to effectively litigate around them, while smaller forums without the same resources will be disproportionately affected. Is that a reasonable fear? If it is, do you see a way to mitigate it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ErMWk"&gt;If you harm your users, you should be sued, no matter how big or small. The solution for small platforms is to honor the people using your product and make it safe. In no other industry is liability for harms based on the size of the business. My law firm of 13 employees can be sued just as easily for harms we cause as a law firm with 2000 employees. My solution is to honor and cherish my clients and not harm them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5ZNrY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If lawmakers did something like entirely repeal Section 230, how do you practically think the internet would change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOaoVl"&gt;It would improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="paj7Us"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AWMAYU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katie Jordan, director of public policy and technology for the Internet Society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SS2c4Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet Society is a nonprofit founded in 1992 by internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. It supports efforts to increase internet access worldwide, construct community networks in unconnected areas, and maintain openness and security online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJRNel"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the Internet Society’s position on changing Section 230?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbpc0v"&gt;I think it’s a great goal to prevent misinformation and hate speech online, but I’m really not convinced that Section 230 is the right way to do that. The risks of change, or of unintended consequences, are significant. And I don’t know if we’re having a large enough conversation about what those risks are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY2U2T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sort of risks are you worried about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOZjKx"&gt;When the Internet Society approaches intermediary liability protection, we look at the whole stack. Section 230 is not just about platforms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It’s also about the underlying infrastructure and the intermediaries that move content and data from one place to another, whether it’s cloud providers, domain name registries, email servers, things like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJan4Q"&gt;If cloud providers get wrapped up in this conversation about pulling back intermediary liability protection, then by default, they’re going to have to reduce privacy and security practices because they’ll have to look at the content they’re storing for you, to know if they’re breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u3gHP1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Section 230 is not just about platforms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRvBSa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that translate to actual pieces of legislation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNs6QA"&gt;The more specific we can be about the goal, the better the legislation will be. So if we’re very clear that there is a problem on social media platforms with misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech, then our goal can be to fix those things. But a lot of the legislation we’ve seen is so broad that it would be very difficult to limit it to just those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DClFBs"&gt;I think it would be fairly easy to say, there is a public concern with a handful of platforms dealing with speech in a way that maybe is not in society’s best interest. Let’s start there and see what we can fix. Because my fear is that if we don’t look very closely at the target, the unintended consequences of this will be so far-reaching that it will do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KBxyOT"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QfTDxl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yiota Souras, senior vice president of general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xCImOp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NCMEC is a government-funded nonprofit organization fighting the abduction, abuse, and exploitation of children. Among other work with victims and law enforcement, it operates the CyberTipline, a system for reporting child exploitation on the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc53o9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Section 230 affect your work at NCMEC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66q5xi"&gt;Section 230 denies victims the ability to bring a lawsuit if they have been exploited in certain ways through or on a particular platform. And because social media companies have that immunity, it reduces the potential that companies will do the most they can to make sure child exploitation content is not posted, not distributed, and is taken down right away, because there is really no legal incentive or for them to take those extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LWRptZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no legal requirement for them to use any kind of detection or screening”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bg3XnF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies do have a lot of non-legal incentives, though, and many of them already put a lot of resources toward this problem. What kind of steps do you think adding legal liability would make them take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i2pR6"&gt;There are a lot of companies, especially some of the very large companies, that engage in really tremendous voluntary measures. But there are a lot of companies that don’t, and there is no legal requirement for them to use any kind of detection or screening. I think the fact that there are some companies that are trying as hard as they can and devoting immense resources and are prioritizing this is great. But they’re just a handful of the companies out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0V1Ij"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s been one carveout already, FOSTA-SESTA, which removed liability protections for trafficking and sex work-related material. What has been the impact of that for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1htcK7"&gt;There have been a lot of ramifications. Backpage.com was taken down before FOSTA-SESTA, and what we’ve seen is that there has been no other central marketplace that’s come up and said “we’re Backpage 2.0.” It’s not normalized in the same way anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5g91bI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you think the value has been as a deterrent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vhd9Cz"&gt;Right. And there have been some criminal and some civil cases that have moved forward representing victims against websites — some that involve a lot of claims, including FOSTA-SESTA. And they’re still working their way through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qM3fK4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yJoiEa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxine Doogan, president of the Erotic Service Providers Legal Education and Research Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n8af9r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPLERP is a legal advocacy group supporting decriminalization and legal protection for sex workers. It was one of several organizations to oppose FOSTA-SESTA on the grounds that it &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackinghustling.org/erased-the-impact-of-fosta-sesta-2020/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;penalized consensual sex work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4ABQ6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s been the impact of FOSTA-SESTA on sex workers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pG0rM"&gt;It’s been a disaster. We lost a whole bunch of our sites, a whole bunch of our advertising. Now we have sites that are charging us huge amounts of money in bitcoin. I think Congress is very conscious of the position that they’re forcing us into, which is that, you know, a bunch of people have lost their jobs. A bunch of people have been forced back onto the streets. A bunch of people have been forced to work together in order to maintain their indoor location because the rents are so high — you could afford it before FOSTA-SESTA, now you can’t because you have less access to advertising. So now you have to share space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJQJCp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A bunch of people have lost their jobs. A bunch of people have been forced back onto the streets.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnK0p7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of newer efforts to change Section 230?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PY0a2a"&gt;They’re missing the point, and they’re missing the bigger issues that society has refused to address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPY3Ic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kinds of issues should lawmakers be focusing on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="reRnQc"&gt;They need an anti-discrimination law for all erotic service providers — we are discriminated against regardless of our legal or illegal status in housing, child custody, and access to education. Financial institutions are being allowed to systematically discriminate against us in access to them. They need to be providing us with some actual rights with their legislation, instead of continuing to strip our rights away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zzqJ1Y"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="q7oDMk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al Smith, communications strategist for the Tor Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nG4kFf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tor Project is the nonprofit behind Tor, an open-source encryption tool for remaining anonymous online. Tor is used by journalists communicating with whistleblowers, human rights activists living under repressive governments, and millions of others worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb4ZVn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Section 230 mean for the Tor Project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYiPzm"&gt;Tor relies on Section 230. Without it, the organization would be vulnerable to lawsuits brought by anyone who believes that a Tor user harmed them. For instance, because of Section 230, if someone uses Tor to protect their identity in order to criticize or report about a governmental official (something journalists and activists often do), Tor cannot be sued for facilitating or aiding and abetting or otherwise. Tor is a small nonprofit, and even a suit that was not meritorious could easily sink it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yQBYoQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tremendous collateral damage to important parts of the internet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uaCa7u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of some of the most common proposals for changing Section 230?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWvnCr"&gt;Overall, these proposals seem to be based on anger at Facebook and Google and a few other tech giants. A huge variety of tools are protected by Section 230, and most of the proposals for changing it will cause tremendous collateral damage to important parts of the internet like Wikimedia, the Internet Archive, and Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzMfGB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a few specific proposals on the table, including rules that require services to remove illegal content. How would those affect you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1BSgH"&gt;Because Tor does not host content, and because of the nature of the tool, it is impossible to know every single person and organization that uses its free, open-source technology. Tor could not comply with any “removal” requirements put forth by some proposals that change Section 230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRqVTx"&gt;Any such law must differentiate between tools that store and host content and those that do not — Tor is the latter. Often these proposals are aimed at forcing tools like Tor to weaken or eliminate their use of encryption (e.g., EARN IT Act), and that would be extremely dangerous for all Tor (and all internet) users who need strong encryption to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PIehQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since Tor is a global service, how much does Section 230 matter for people using it outside the US?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8tl1c"&gt;Section 230 is hugely important for people using Tor outside the United States. Many of our users outside of the US rely on Tor because, in order to stay safe and fight for a better world, they require encryption and security — human rights defenders, political dissidents, journalists, whistleblowers, domestic violence survivors looking to escape, and more. Any effort to “reform” Section 230 that makes Tor less secure or provides an opportunity for litigation against it for what its users do could be catastrophic for users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9l7Kbk"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wqj2SN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Anne Franks, president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5WB8Fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary Anne Franks is a professor at the University of Miami School of Law as well as the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, an organization that combats civil rights abuses online. She also drafted the first model criminal statute banning nonconsensual pornography or “revenge porn” online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfoKMU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has Section 230’s impact been on the internet? What would the internet look like if it had never been passed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsnJ2w"&gt;The internet with Section 230 is like an auto industry with no safety regulations or a restaurant industry with no hygiene standards. Imagining an internet without Section 230 requires imagining what kinds of industry standards would have developed over the last 20 years if tech companies had not been assured that they could act as recklessly as they wanted without fear of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IReqfY"&gt;How might companies have designed their platforms and services differently if they knew they could be held responsible for failing to take reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable harms? How much less likely would it be that the internet would be controlled by a tiny number of multibillion-dollar corporations wielding power without responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TAt0rb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How might companies have designed their platforms and services differently if they knew they could be held responsible?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zDewMA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How deep should this responsibility go? Should infrastructure providers like Cloudflare, web hosts, and domain registrars be responsible for their customers’ content, or for the content their customers allow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpevqC"&gt;These kinds of questions are impossible to answer in advance because they are so contingent on the facts of particular situations, and Section 230 keeps them from getting to courts where they can be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a1Usi"&gt;In addition to very (some, like me, would say, overly) robust First Amendment protections, there are lots of challenges to holding a third party responsible for the conduct of someone else. If Section 230 were repealed tomorrow, it wouldn’t mean that Cloudflare or Facebook or any online intermediary would suddenly become liable for user behavior. It would simply mean that at least some of the time, online intermediaries would have to show up to court and explain why they aren’t liable, and sometimes they would lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1e7oxL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of content that people complain about, like misinformation, seems like a First Amendment question rather than a Section 230 question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3YW2G"&gt;The First Amendment is not a fixed rule, and what it protects in 2021 is very different from what it protected in 1996 or 1896 or 1789. It is not, despite many Americans’ passionate belief to the contrary, a clear, consistent, or principled doctrine. It has chiefly served to protect powerful groups’ right to speak freely, even and especially when that speech chills the speech of less powerful groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FimL2J"&gt;The Section 230 debate is so fraught in part because the public has been trained to believe that everything they do online is speech, and that none of this speech can be regulated. But people use the internet for a vast array of activities, from buying toilet paper to making hotel reservations to watching movies, and it has been used by intermediaries to avoid liability for many things that would not qualify as protected speech under the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2lyY2"&gt;That problem could be addressed by replacing the word “information” in Section c(1) with “speech,” making it clear that the law’s protections cannot extend beyond protected speech. That by itself won’t solve all the problems with Section 230, but it would be a way to rein in some of its worst excesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FgVphe"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1IXfdr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Tushnet, co-founder of the Organization for Transformative Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8XlU3M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebecca Tushnet is a professor at Harvard Law School. She is also a co-founder of the Organization for Transformative Works, a nonprofit that supports fanworks through projects like the Archive Of Our Own (AO3), a Hugo Award-winning archive hosting more than 7 million fanworks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DG6DVR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Section 230 important for the Archive Of Our Own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfEatj"&gt;Section 230 shapes what happens every day — it allows us to moderate with confidence that, if we make one mistake, the hundreds of times we remove content that violates our policies won’t be held against us. 230 is vital in allowing our volunteers who handle abuse complaints to make reasonable decisions without having a lawyer review every ticket they see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C2romj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The question that I have is, what do you want the world to look like?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKQKDK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some lawmakers want to require sites to remove illegal content within 24 hours. How would that affect AO3?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWLQGN"&gt;That seems both not very troubling and completely unresponsive to the things that everyone is complaining about. There is only one site of any note of which I am aware — Ripoff Report — that refuses on 230 grounds to remove content that a court has found illegal (and even it wiggles on that, I believe). Most sites respond to court orders voluntarily, enough so that there’s a real problem of forged court orders used to remove content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BbkGn"&gt;I think this is a big gap in understanding: even most awful, abusive messages on their own are not illegal. If one person sends a stream of abusive messages, maybe that’s harassment, but if 100 different people send one message, none of them are actually liable for criminal harassment unless we change the criminal law. And there are reasons we might do that, but we definitely haven’t yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcx9qS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there legal changes that could push Facebook or Google to moderate better, but wouldn’t catch smaller operations like AO3 in the crossfire?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cnuoyk"&gt;I think we’re increasingly seeing really interesting discussions around using antitrust law. So antitrust remedies don’t necessarily have to include breaking somebody up. They can include saying, “Okay, this is how you have to behave.” I have to say, though, I have some — not a great deal, but some — sympathy for Facebook. Because remember the scale they’re dealing with. So even if they’re right 99.9999 percent of the time, the one time that they screw up is going to be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Dq9I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a counterargument that if a site is designed to scale in a way that makes tragedies inevitable, you should just say it’s sort of “unsafe at any speed.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg4hpE"&gt;The question that I have is, what do you want the world to look like? Because let’s be realistic about this: a site that does not make billions of dollars a year in advertising will not have 100,000 people doing content moderation. If you want a full-time staff moderating all content, then you need to figure out how that will be paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GOWFpu"&gt;If what you’re saying is, we don’t want this volume of speech online — that is a thing to say, but I think it has real consequences for lots of good stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;
