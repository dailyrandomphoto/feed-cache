    <title>We gave this laptop a 7, then a Swedish metal band turned it up to 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lenovo commercial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4h3F9O21kejtOotldDDTaTRv8WE=/1x0:1494x995/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657174/10thgen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckCm0j"&gt;If you’re interested in learning about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt; gaming laptop, I now have &lt;em&gt;much more&lt;/em&gt; than a mere written review to share with you. A Swedish metal band was paid by an ad agency that’s representing Lenovo to scream a few choice lines from my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRNBUR"&gt;To be clear, this is an ad. The agency asked for my permission to use some quotes from our review, and I said yes. That was in early November, and I quite honestly forgot about what I had agreed to. Then today, at the height of our collective &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; grind at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it appeared in my inbox. It gave all of us some much-needed dumb delight, and maybe you’ll get a laugh out of it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo commercial" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMHuE2TYOt3VZKGCXKmeBC-dXEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230591/10thgen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QektrP"&gt;There’s nothing like hearing the lines “10th Gen Intel Core processors” and “attractive, yet plainly designed gaming laptop” screamed in a guttural tone, while the Legion 5i just idly sits there during the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2425p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T TV Now is now AT&amp;T TV — here’s what that means</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AT&amp;amp;amp;T stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BX0aDnxWYKYdS2IYkkOtm6hoIUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657130/att1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dF3KyV"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now is no more. New customers can no longer sign up for telecom’s skinny bundle TV service, similar to YouTube TV or Hulu with Live TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzMJnE"&gt;Instead, customers can only &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/att-tv-national-launch-directv-pricing-cord-cutting-1203520138/"&gt;sign up for AT&amp;amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put: AT&amp;amp;T now has one virtual TV service instead of two. Existing customers will be able to continue accessing the service and shouldn’t experience any disruptions, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pebvro"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has rolled in parts of AT&amp;amp;T TV Now into AT&amp;amp;T TV, including getting rid of the annual contract and not requiring people to own the AT&amp;amp;T TV hardware. Instead, people can use their own compatible devices (Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, etc.) to stream, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.atttvnow.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F12%2F22226881%2Fatt-tv-now-streaming-skinny-bundle-cord-cutting-youtube-hulu-fubo#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to AT&amp;amp;T’s website&lt;/a&gt;. There are three different pricing tiers that customers can choose from depending on what channels they want, including add-ons like additional sports and premium channels like HBO. Prices range from $70 to $95, more than double AT&amp;amp;T TV Now’s original starting price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z8WFP"&gt;“We’re bringing more value and simplicity by merging these two streaming services into a single AT&amp;amp;T TV experience,” Vince Torres, senior vice president of marketing at AT&amp;amp;T, told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pKnWp"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now has been a tumultuous bet, even if you look beyond the fact that AT&amp;amp;T took an already confusing naming scheme (DirecTV and DirecTV Now) and made it &lt;em&gt;even worse &lt;/em&gt;(they became AT&amp;amp;T TV and AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747190/directv-now-rebrand-att-tv-streaming-app"&gt;respectively, in 2019&lt;/a&gt;). Launched in 2016 at $35 a month for 65 channels, the idea was to hop on the cord-cutting trend. It worked for a minute, but as AT&amp;amp;T faced continuous rising costs, licensing woes, and increased competition from new players, numbers started dropping. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUyTViMSBgO7vK_Y6sovxYI3CEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230337/unnamed__16_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light blue box keeps shrinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CwVWIK"&gt;In September 2018, AT&amp;amp;T TV Now controlled 25 percent of internet TV subscriber market share; by September 2020, that dropped to just 8 percent, according to data from analytical firm Antenna. While Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, and Fubo are all seeing some growth, AT&amp;amp;T TV Now has radically shrunk. Throw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17525240/directv-now-price-att-40"&gt;rising prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2019/11/12/tv-station-blackouts-are-accelerating-heres-why/?sh=38f9e74b7f6c"&gt;channel blackouts&lt;/a&gt; caused over licensing disagreements, and it’s not difficult to see why AT&amp;amp;T TV Now failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MxKsE"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T TV Now went from a peak of 1.86 million customers in the third quarter of 2018 to less than 685,000 in September 2020. More often than not, trying to find the balance between the cost to run skinny bundle TV services and keeping monthly subscription prices low results in a path to a profitless future. Even if former AT&amp;amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson thought otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5Ri0h"&gt;“[We are absolutely convinced that this is going to be very, very attractive for a large group of customers who really aren’t even in the market today,” Stephenson said in 2016 ahead of DirecTV Now’s (then AT&amp;amp;T TV Now) launch, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/att-tv-now-shutting-down-1234883328/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhMHKK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ztb66O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvKvtQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: chronicling the past week in content moderation</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q9RyRc"&gt;The first &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 2021 focuses on the topic we’re thinking about the most at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this month (and probably the foreseeable future): &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;content moderation on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a3VJ4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Adi Robertson, and Casey Newton chronicle the past week of social media platforms taking action since the Capitol riot: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Trump getting banned &lt;/a&gt;from sites like Twitter and Facebook and social app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Parler being removed from app stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11F92t"&gt;The crew also dives into what this means for the future of content moderation for Big Tech, regulation surrounding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and the role of competition for social media platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Ffo3"&gt;You can listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer has created a concept N95 mask with RGB and voice projection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hE1lj1zR7MLVdGkpUEwXrbhH35o=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68657047/razer_mask_smaller.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bsAXqu"&gt;Razer claims to have made the world’s smartest mask: its new reusable N95 respirator called Project Hazel. It’s a concept design with a glossy outside shell made of waterproof and scratch-resistant recycled plastic, which is transparent to allow for lip-reading and seeing facial cues when you chat with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQfnyR"&gt;Currently, there isn’t a price or release date attached. Razer refers to Project Hazel as a surgical N95, but it hasn’t yet earned any of the necessary approvals and certifications from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Razer said it is working with a team of medical experts and scientists who are helping to develop the mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXYGro"&gt;The main features of this mask lie within its two circular zones that flank your mouth. They’re used for ventilation, giving the device an almost futuristic gas mask look. Razer claims Project Hazel will use active disc-type ventilators, filtering air that’s breathed in, as well as the CO2 that’s being exhaled. The company adds that it will be certified to filter 95 percent of airborne particles, including the COVID-19 virus and other common pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MsGRl"&gt;These ventilators are detachable and rechargeable, though Razer is still hammering out the details on two very important factors: how long they’ll be effective and how Razer will alert the user when it’s time for a new one. A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the ventilators’ longevity is still being tested, and when the filters need to be changed, Razer envisions users being notified via a mobile companion app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TFg4Vb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvWiCclESL8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahEE8V"&gt;Microphones and amplifiers embedded in the ventilators will project your voice through the mask, so you won’t have to worry about sounding muffled. We haven’t seen this in action yet or had the chance to try it out ourselves. Razer told us that it’s working with THX sound engineers to find a balance in terms of how loud the speakers should be for accessibility purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOYXaU"&gt;Razer asserts that Project Hazel is comfortable despite all of the tech inside. The mask makes a seal around your nose and chin with a silicon guard, and it uses adjustable ear loops so that most people should be able to find the right fit (though it is likely quite a bit heavier than your average mask).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmehwQ"&gt;Of course, this wouldn’t be a modern Razer product if it didn’t support Chroma RGB LEDs. Each of the respirator-meets-amplifier rings can glow in the color of your choosing. And when it gets dark, a set of LEDs activate automatically to shine light on your mouth so others can still see you talk. It’s tough to tell just how effective these LEDs will be in fully illuminating your mouth, but they may be helpful nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Hazel" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jnx4UmRFWu7CkemWUzDgnv5oDn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228437/hazelnight.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LEDs automatically switch on inside of the mask once it’s dark out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ48tB"&gt;Razer envisions that each Project Hazel mask will include a large charging case that sterilizes the mask with UV light when it’s not in use, although this is still in the concept stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilEhdE"&gt;Most of us already have countless masks, but there’s certainly a place for Project Hazel in the world — if it ever comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rollout OLED is a great idea, but it’s just an idea for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kFaRZM"&gt;Razer has one more announcement for CES 2021, and it’s purely conceptual. It’s called Project Brooklyn, and (since you can’t tell from the name) it’s a high-end gaming chair with built-in haptics and a rollout curved OLED screen. Theoretically, it supports inputs from all of your gaming sources, making it the ultimate game station. But without an in-person CES, it seems like Razer didn’t feel the need to churn out a physical mockup of Project Brooklyn. We’ll see if some aspects of this idea make it into future products; the rumbling haptics seem like the most practical components.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ ROG Claymore II mechanical keyboard has a handy detachable number pad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus Claymore II" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_4md1mgNZrOsScaq72xiGng5Uo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656969/asusrogclaymoreii.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0yIXOr"&gt;Asus announced a new mechanical keyboard at CES 2021 called the ROG Claymore II. It’s designed for gamers, with customizable macro keys and per-key RGB backlighting. It’s also the first device to feature Asus’ own ROG RX Blue or Red optical switches with a claimed 100 million keypress lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGtIO1"&gt;This model gives a nod to people who just can’t totally quit the numpad: you can detach it to make the Claymore II an 80 percent keyboard if you need to save space or magnetically attach it when you need to crunch some numbers. The numpad also offers more intuitive media controls, like a volume dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVYCJx"&gt;The ROG Claymore II connects either via a USB-C cable or wireless via 2.4GHz. If you use it wirelessly, its 4,000mAh battery is supposed to last for up to 40 hours. Asus says the USB-C port supports fast charging and USB passthrough for other devices. This model will be released in Q2 2021; Asus hasn’t yet shared a price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus Gladius III Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eYmkr9FyGcJ91Afo4vggFT0WvNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230700/asusgladiusIII.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MK12Tu"&gt;Asus has also announced its new ROG Gladius III Wireless gaming mouse. The mouse doesn’t have a final price or a specific release date (beyond its Q2 2021 target), but the design and specs are worth knowing about. The Gladius III Wireless looks similar to the Razer DeathAdder V2, which we cited as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;the best wired gaming mouse to buy&lt;/a&gt;. The new device’s sensor supports up to 19,000 DPI, and it can be connected with a wire or wirelessly via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth. Asus says a purely wired version of this mouse will release at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqbRC0"&gt;Notably, the ROG Gladius III allows for user-replaceable switches so you can find the right feel for your needs — even letting you swap between three-pin mechanical and five-pin Omron optical switches. Most people likely will never put their mice under such stress that they’ll reach the end of their switches’ lifespan, but having the option to swap them out is certainly a nice feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Univision enters the streaming race with PrendeTV, a free, ad-supported Spanish platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="View of the Univision Building in Los An" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knVITThfkJZoajpSmbmy2MjD5_Q=/0x0:3504x2336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656898/71309339.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QR7ySe"&gt;Created “exclusively for the U.S. Hispanic audience,” PrendeTV is Univision’s entry into the streaming wars, offering a collection of free Spanish programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Mzwm"&gt;PrendeTV, which gets its name for the Spanish phrase for “switch on,” will launch this quarter, &lt;a href="https://corporate.univision.com/blog/2021/01/12/univision-announces-prendetv-1st-premium-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-built-exclusively-for-u-s-hispanics/"&gt;according to Univision&lt;/a&gt;. The service will have “an unprecedented collection of high-quality, curated Spanish-language series [and] movies,” as well as some other entertainment. PrendeTV will also offer 30 live channels and more than 10,000 hours of on-demand content at launch, according to the company, with the goal to expand that offering once launched. It will be available on desktop and mobile, as well as a free app on connected TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlBlfD"&gt;Univision’s biggest competitor in the Spanish marketplace for US customers, Telemundo, does not have its own streaming service. Owned by NBCUniversal, Telemundo instead has a hub and several “channels” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix"&gt;on Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, NBCUniversal’s own ad-supported streaming platform. Univision CEO Wade Davis, who previously worked on ad-supported streaming strategy at ViacomCBS, told &lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;in 2020 that “it’s remarkable” there’s not really a “high-quality, differentiated OTT service for this audience that is at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiSm0H"&gt;“It’s a huge opportunity that is completely open from a competitive standpoint,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="752NaA"&gt;Although Univision is entering an already crowded market, with services like Disney Plus, HBO Max, Peacock, Apple TV Plus, and more launching all within the last 14 months, Univision is banking on PrendeTV being “the only premium, free ad-supported streaming service designed and curated exclusively for U.S. Hispanics.” The fact that it’s free, something that ViacomCBS is also reportedly seeing success with on its own ad-supported platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/22/6054639/the-genius-of-pluto-tv"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt;, should also help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxeiVd"&gt;Exact launch dates, new exclusive series, and what platforms it will be available on will be announced closer to launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAwA1f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus has a 32-inch 4K gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1 shipping later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Swift PG32UQ" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pkY_gvaUWofSeGTO_8wF_Qao5bs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656715/asusswifthero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Swift PG32UQ will be a G-Sync-compatible gaming monitor&lt;/em&gt; | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="53bQpD"&gt;Asus is gearing up to release its first gaming monitor to support HDMI 2.1, which boasts enough bandwidth to display up to 4K resolution at 120 frames per second when connected to a compatible Windows PC, Xbox Series X, or PS5. The ROG Swift PG32UQ is, according to Asus, the world’s first 32-inch HDMI 2.1 gaming monitor, and both of its HDMI ports support the latest standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0YZpl"&gt;Connecting via DisplayPort 1.4 allows this monitor to display 4K at a 144Hz refresh rate on PC if you have components capable enough to soar that high. For this feature, Asus credits a technology called Display Stream Compression (DSC) that compresses UHD streams without a perceptible drop in visual quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRcvFb"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;Acer Nitro XV28 announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, the ROG Swift PG32UQ won’t ship until sometime in Q2 2021. Asus hasn’t shared a price for this model, but don’t expect anything under $899 — that’s Acer’s price for the smaller 28-inch Nitro XV28. Both have a 4K 144Hz IPS panel with a 1ms response time, but the Asus device might end up being the preferred choice among PC gamers since it has a bigger screen with Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. (The XV28 has FreeSync Premium.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCDP2S"&gt;Asus says the Swift is currently undergoing the certification process, but at launch, it should be compatible with Nvidia’s variable refresh rate mode to eliminate screen tearing and artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Swift PG32UQ" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2cMEdh92V2Zt7-esxM6vhX6b8pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230184/asusswiftrear.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rear view of the PG32UQ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CfM6Qx"&gt;The ROG Swift PG32UQ supports HDR 600, allowing it to reach 600 cd/m2 peak brightness. That’s a bit brighter than the aforementioned Acer Nitro but still comparatively dim next to many other HDR-ready displays. The display is factory-calibrated for color accuracy, with full coverage of the sRGB gamut and 98 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG’s 2021 lineup includes its first convertible gaming laptop (ish)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ROG Flow X13 facing the camera, angled slightly to the right in front of a white background. The screen displays the ROG logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rspNsA9m39ZkYDVm7WFT15RlOw=/0x834:5000x4167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656695/07_GV301_V5_Lighting.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s right — this is for gaming.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6bnxR"&gt;Asus Republic of Gamers (ROG) has unveiled its varied, eclectic, and very cool-looking lineup of new gaming laptops for 2021. The highlight, and the product I’m both very excited and very confused about, is the ROG Flow X13. It’s the company’s first 2-in-1 convertible gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJNyZx"&gt;That’s right — a 2-in-1 gaming laptop. You don’t see that every day. What’s more, as you may have deduced from the name, the X13 is a &lt;em&gt;13-inch&lt;/em&gt; convertible gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSqbdK"&gt;As you can probably see from the above picture, the X13 doesn’t look like your typical gaming rig. It’s the type of thing I wouldn’t be surprised to see someone whip out in a class or a meeting. Portability is a theme here: Asus says you’ll get up to 10 hours of video playback on a charge and that the 100-watt USB-C charger delivers 50 percent in 30 minutes. You can choose between a 120Hz FHD touch display or a 3840 x 2400 touch display. Either way, you get a 16:10 aspect ratio with extra vertical space for multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2Vr9dJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zy0kqW7xVZ8?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=7&amp;amp;start=7" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cJCk6f"&gt;All of that sounds nice enough, but the insides are where things get confusing. The Flow X13 includes up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 5980HS, one of the flagships in its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;Ryzen 5000 mobile series&lt;/a&gt;. That makes sense for a gaming laptop. You’d think that should be paired with a pretty powerful GPU — but instead, Asus went with the entry-level GeForce GTX 1650, which just feels like a waste of the 5980HS’s power. Similar combinations have been tried before: take a look at &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;writer Cameron Faulkner’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21295596/lenovo-ideapad-gaming-3-review-laptop-budget-friendly-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-geforce-gtx"&gt;review of Lenovo’s IdeaPad Gaming 3&lt;/a&gt;, which also attempted to pair the GTX 1650 with an H-series processor to disappointing results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbSRs0"&gt;Now, for a regular work laptop that might occasionally be used to edit some photos, that combination makes a lot of sense. But if you’re purchasing the X13 expecting incredible frame rates, you may end up disappointed. (Of course, I’ll need to run games on the thing myself before making a recommendation either way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjdgFl"&gt;The way Asus is trying to get around this is it’s bundling the Flow X13 with an external GPU called the ROG XG Mobile. This can include up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 graphics, and Asus says it’ll deliver desktop gaming performance to the X13. It acts as a power adapter as well. Fair enough. But with the bundle of the X13 and the XG Mobile, you’re looking at a price of $2,999.99. Yeesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpQ3Bf"&gt;You can preorder the Flow X13 and XG Mobile now at the &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM120000009"&gt;Asus store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f6VmzOReRiST9REu3gZYLlQLcGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230738/06_GC31.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have to admit it looks very cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zB8zBT"&gt;Another headliner (which is perhaps a bit more practical) is the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 SE. This is a refresh to the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15, which has two screens — the regular one (a 15.6-inch, 4K, 120Hz panel or a 300Hz FHD panel) and the ScreenPad Plus (a 14.1-inch touch display that’s built into the top half of the keyboard deck — choose 3840 x 1100 or 1920 x 550 resolution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S4lKbr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNqv5LgODvI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s9OK8d"&gt;The form factor means that, in theory, you could run a game on the top screen with a Spotify playlist or Discord chat on the bottom screen, though my experience with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review"&gt;previous Zephyrus Duo 15&lt;/a&gt; is that your mileage on that varies by game. Perhaps more promising is that Asus says it’s working with game developers and companies like Adobe to customize content for the dual-screen setup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zephyrus Duo 15 SE angled to the left. The primary screen displays the ROG logo. The ScreenPad Plus displays Asus’s home screen. The RGB keyboard is illuminated. The touchpad displays an LED numpad." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nr-58heZgCEsCwNf09btnnrfC2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230743/GX551_C04_v10_ok.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at that beauty. The touchpad even becomes a numpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2S56wA"&gt;The main update is that the new Duo 15 comes with up to an eight-core AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. There’s a new “Arc Flow” fan design, which Asus says can help dissipate “up to 165W of combined processor power.” You’ll also get up to 2TB of storage and up to 32GB of combined onboard and SO-DIMM memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He373V"&gt;You can preorder the Zephyrus Duo 15 SE now at the &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM090000010"&gt;Asus store&lt;/a&gt; for $2,899.99. (Yes, it’s cheaper than the Flow X13 bundle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GdunWj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxL3PrcqQWw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xBkFRh"&gt;Finally, there are two big additions to the esports side: the Strix Scar 15 and Strix Scar 17. Both models have an optical-mechanical keyboard, the first one ever to appear on a Scar model. They’ve also gotten a higher screen-to-body ratio (up to 85 percent), a bigger battery, an updated cooling system, support for Type-C charging, and quad speakers with Dolby Atmos technology. The Scar 17 now offers a 360Hz panel option, the fastest display you can get on a laptop. And both models include the new Ryzen and Nvidia chips, up to a Ryzen 9 5900HX and a GeForce RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 seen from above with the RGB keybaord illuminated. The screen displays the ROG logo on a purple background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GI9IXLlNlolpr3NzsWZzTOgIfX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230746/01_Scar_17_L.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check that per-key RGB lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lVSE8h"&gt;The Strix Scar 15 and Strix Scar 17 are coming to North America in Q1 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmNhKu"&gt;Asus also announced the Strix G15 and Strix 17, lower-key Strix models for gamers who aren’t serious esports players. These can also come with a Ryzen 9 5900HX processor but max out at a GeForce RTX 3070 and a 300Hz screen. The G15 is coming to North America in Q1 2021; the G17 is up for preorder now for &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM090000007"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker unveils $129 Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro wireless earbuds with ANC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3siE4PBSh7bwlkj9Q5Ik8B9eaLk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656406/anker.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fdl75M"&gt;The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds are one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;best options in the budget category&lt;/a&gt;, and now the Anker brand has returned with a more advanced model. The Liberty Air 2 Pro buds are focused on sound quality and active noise cancellation (ANC), and like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/8/3/17645534/best-wireless-earbuds-airpods-jabra-samsung-sony-anker/comment/483871881"&gt;the larger Liberty 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; feature 11mm drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKqGU5"&gt;The new model has improved ANC with modes designed to fit various situations — the transport mode blocks out lower frequencies, for example, while the indoor mode is better at reducing mid-range sounds like voices in an office. There’s also a transparency mode with two levels of ambient sound enhancement, and Anker is touting “premium call quality” thanks to six-mic noise reduction tech. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UzhApFZfD8xHhzhvSNKi5IW1Rms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229805/A3951_Liberty_Air_2_Pro__Four_Up_Earbud_Colors.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cf3Ed8"&gt;Anker says the Liberty Air 2 Pro should get seven hours of battery life with ANC off, or six with it on. With the case fully charged, Anker is quoting 26 total hours of endurance with ANC off and 21 with it on, so you’re probably looking at getting three to four full recharges from the case depending on your usage. The case can be charged over USB-C or wirelessly with Qi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oPuer"&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro will be available in four colors (black, white, blue, and pink) and will go on sale today for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nB44IQ"&gt;The second season of the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League will begin play next month. Today, Activision Blizzard announced that the CDL regular season for 2021 will kick off with an opening event from February 11th–14th, though the actual schedule and matchups have yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvZTGU"&gt;The league debuted last year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21078871/call-of-duty-league-opening-weekend-esports-activision-blizzard"&gt;an ambitious plan to blend city-based teams with esports&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279107/overwatch-league-may-melee-tournament-structure-blizzard"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the pandemic, the CDL — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196237/esports-leagues-online-coronavirus-call-of-duty-overwatch-league-of-legends"&gt;along with most other competitive gaming leagues&lt;/a&gt; — was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177465/call-of-duty-league-cdl-overwatch-owl-online-games-esports-coronavirus"&gt;shift to an online format&lt;/a&gt;. The season culminated with a championship weekend in August where the Dallas Empire won &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;a literal throne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KDPC19"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Call of Duty League’s championship team will win this ridiculous throne","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"},{"title":"Nadeshot on getting back into Call of Duty with the Los Angeles Thieves","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552513/100-thieves-call-of-duty-league-cdl-la-nadeshot-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uyrlka"&gt;The 2021 season will introduce &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZ5tdr27aE"&gt;a few changes&lt;/a&gt;, including 4 vs. 4 gameplay and a shift to PC. There will also be a new team among the 12 CDL clubs: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;the Los Angeles Thieves&lt;/a&gt; will replace Optic Gaming Los Angeles. Like last year, all games will be broadcast exclusively on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzYP7s"&gt;While the season won’t start until next month, a preseason event will take place on January 23rd and 24th, where fans from the top three teams last year — Dallas, Atlanta, and Chicago — will be able to vote on who they play against.&lt;/p&gt;
