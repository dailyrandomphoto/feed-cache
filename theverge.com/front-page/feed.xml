    <title>Best Buy pulls TCL Google TVs amid complaints of slow, buggy software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/speHBcienQnWeFQXFBYRIf-kme4=/20x0:2168x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251693/327063D4_692F_4275_A45A_6A2026E0BFEF.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VaLJJm"&gt;Back in late summer, TCL announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;upgraded version of its high-end 6-Series TV&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from some technical improvements — the newer set fully supports HDMI 2.1 and 4K gaming at 120Hz — the biggest change had to do with software, with the latest 6-Series running Google TV instead of the Roku OS that has shipped on many of TCL’s most popular sets in the United States. The company has already released TVs powered by Android TV internationally and on a few budget models in North America, but the 2021 6-Series was meant to be a combined showcase for TCL hardware and Google software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkl6Du"&gt;So far, it’s not working out that way, and things aren’t going quite as well as TCL might’ve hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XqmHWT"&gt;Some early buyers of the 6-Series with Google TV (model R646) have complained about what they describe as a buggy, sluggish user interface. I myself have been reviewing a 65-inch model over the past couple weeks, and while the Google TV home screen seems to work relatively well, it didn’t take long for me to notice some general slowness when pulling up and going through the settings menu. There can also be a lag before the TV reacts to remote control commands. My roommates have observed crashing apps and a few instances where the TV itself froze and became unresponsive. Some online reviews cite more annoying problems that require unplugging the TV altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAcBz9"&gt;Similar early criticisms have also been leveled at the 5-Series with Google TV; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1RPvpz5H0U4"&gt;Caleb at &lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found his review unit to be on the slow side and ran into several bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZeQ5novFx3uBWAhquLlHq4PFo-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076791/E4A32016_080D_41C0_8688_6F461E5E3C4E.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tcltvs/comments/r9yiux/will_the_google_tv_os_get_faster_on_the_s546_new/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; about the 5-Series with Google TV is equally applicable to the 6-Series.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ulo5vT"&gt;TCL has already rolled out several software updates meant to improve performance and stability. “Our priority is to deliver an optimized user experience with Google TV and have a cadence of planned software updates for TCL devices,” TCL spokesperson Rachelle Parks told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in late November. Some of those updates do seem to have made a positive difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5nH2w"&gt;But as of this week, Best Buy — the exclusive US retailer of the TCL Google TVs — has abruptly removed both models from its store listings. &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/products/home-theater/6-series/55-class-6-series-4k-qled-hdr-smart-google-tv-55r646"&gt;TCL’s own website&lt;/a&gt; has a link to Best Buy that no longer works. Prior to the removal, the 65-inch 6-Series I’m testing &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Freviews%2Ftcl-65-class-6-series-mini-led-qled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv%2F6470277&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had an average review rating of 3.5 stars&lt;/a&gt;. Many reviews praise the panel and Mini LED picture quality but go on to list issues encountered with the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq3o3k"&gt;While TCL is familiar with Android TV, the Google TV software experience is new territory for the company, and clearly, it’s having a rough go at this early stage. I hope a lot of the performance issues can be ironed out with more updates; this really is a fantastic TV, with terrific peak brightness and excellent contrast thanks to that Mini LED backlighting. But it’s not where it needs to be right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX4StJ"&gt;In fact, I’ve already gone ahead and plugged an Apple TV 4K into one of the HDMI ports just to avoid the sluggishness and jank. Streaming devices are a great way to speed up budget TVs, but they shouldn’t be a necessary bandaid for a TV with an MSRP of over $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S60Fdn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to both TCL and Best Buy for more details. This could be a supply shortage situation, or perhaps TCL is taking a beat to assess next steps for its new Google TVs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DN-viq88iRgLXKnBD9TUqV9LjhM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251636/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyTsr3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the fact that there was no requirement for a time period, the agreement clearly stated "in a prominent and visible location on the People site".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f6ksV6"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, Apple also ignored changes to the settlement requested by the NLRB. Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788245/cher-scarlett-apple-nlrb-settlement-leaves-company-appletoo-pay-equity"&gt;left the company in November&lt;/a&gt;, after filing the complaint that accused the company of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” While at the company, she worked to let employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;discuss and gather data about pay equity&lt;/a&gt; and was part of #AppleToo, a campaign about the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;failure to deal with harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple has reportedly closed an Apple Store in Texas due to a COVID-19 outbreak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GlyHyyF7X96_IbKY3YI_o7wC6Yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251538/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me4IJw"&gt;Apple closed one of its Southlake, Texas retail stores Wednesday after many staff members contracted COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/apple-store-texas-closes-covid-outbreak-rcna8000"&gt;according to NBC News&lt;em&gt;’ &lt;/em&gt;Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. A manager told employees Wednesday that 22 staffers “have shared that they’re positive for COVID-19,” NBC News reported, and four of the store’s 151 employees reported positive cases right after Black Friday. The store will be closed through Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnEhom"&gt;NBC News’ report highlights a few worrying trends about the Southlake location. One employee said they had previously raised concerns about being unable to keep social distancing. He and another employee said the store was packed “shoulder to shoulder” on Black Friday. And a manager at the Southlake store apparently had asked employees to come even if they had called in sick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ftJJuM"&gt;NBC spoke with four current and former employees at the Southlake store who said they’ve received calls from their manager encouraging them to come to work, even when they called out sick. In two of these cases, the employee had taken the Covid-19 survey and the results said not to come in. The manager did not respond to requests for comment from NBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N5atlM"&gt;Apple’s official policy requires retail staffers to wear masks and to take a COVID-19 survey before they go to work. They &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;must also be tested for COVID-19 frequently&lt;/a&gt;: unvaccinated workers must be tested twice per week and vaccinated workers tested once per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrpsZe"&gt;The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Schiffer reported this month for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of Apple’s frontline workers find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;working conditions to be untenable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDHSeq"&gt;Most of Apple’s corporate employees will return to the offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;in a hybrid work pilot&lt;/a&gt; beginning February 1st. The company originally announced its hybrid work plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; with the intent to return in September, but that was delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;to January&lt;/a&gt; and then to February. Facebook parent company Meta has also recently updated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1469042247450513410"&gt;its return to work policies&lt;/a&gt;. Offices will fully reopen on January 31st, but staff will be able to defer coming back by three to five months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford stops taking reservations for the F-150 Lightning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Noo_2E1bgoyZ8BCx9P9PA2hrIvc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251187/akrales_20210526_4595_0085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIRLIa"&gt;Ford has &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;stopped taking reservations&lt;/a&gt; for the all-electric F-150 Lightning as it prepares to start making and shipping the new pickup truck in the first half of 2022. The company says it has collected 200,000 refundable $100 deposits for the Lightning since it debuted in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXPMPy"&gt;That means that anyone not already in line may have to wait a while to buy Ford’s first mass-market electric pickup truck off a dealer lot (or order one from the company’s website). Ford hasn’t said how many it plans to build in 2022, but &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that the automaker is looking to build as many as 80,000 in 2023. The company has publicly said it wants to build that many in 2024 after originally targeting just 40,000 annually and has been hiring new workers to handle the demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JKLJJT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Lightning starts at $40,000&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IpjInH"&gt;The F-150 Lightning starts at $40,000 but can more than double depending on which version people buy. That base model is supposed to offer around 230 miles of range and has a more bare-bones interior, including a 12-inch landscape touchscreen display that runs Sync 4. Higher trims will come with the same 15.5-inch vertical touchscreen from the Mustang Mach-E, and there’s an extended range battery option that can push the range to around 300 miles. Towing capacity ranges between 7,700 and 10,000 pounds, depending on the configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XdV8EN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford F-150 Lightning revealed: an electric truck for the masses","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sC14Jv"&gt;Reservation holders will be able to spec out their Lightnings starting in January, just a few months before the first trucks are supposed to ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez4Q90"&gt;As long as they start shipping on time, Ford will join Rivian and GMC as the only automakers with an electric pickup truck on the market. (Rivian started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;shipping its R1T pickup in October&lt;/a&gt;, while GMC’s electric Hummer pickup is supposed to start reaching customers by the end of this year.) Tesla’s long-promised Cybertruck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;has been pushed to next year&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Elon Musk has said his company won’t start making them in large volumes until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Life360 makes millions selling location data, and it’s about to buy Tile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An iPhone is in the center showing the Life360 app with locations of family members on a map. Surrounding the iPhone are images of trackable items by Tile and people and pets for Life360." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BiVIxwXkL3N4CE163DbmY7grN0E=/91x0:3241x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251172/One_Map_To_Rule_Them_All.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Life360’s marketing image of acquiring Tile is also a reminder of how much data it owns now | Image: Life360&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7UuBs"&gt;Life360, the company that bills its product as a “family safety service,” has been selling location data on its 31 million customers — including kids — since 2016, &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/12/06/the-popular-family-safety-app-life360-is-selling-precise-location-data-on-its-tens-of-millions-of-user"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebad8L"&gt;Former employees from data broker companies told &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;that Life360 is “one of the largest sources of data” for what has become a $12 billion phone location tracking industry. In November, the company announced it’s reached a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22797559/tile-bluetooth-tracker-location-gps-acquisition-life360"&gt;acquire&lt;/a&gt; the popular item tracking company Tile for $205 million and said it plans to pursue a dual public listing in the US (it’s currently listed on the Australian Securities Exchange) next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="LhNA7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;there are currently no plans to sell Tile’s data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5G3PH0"&gt;“Our philosophy has been first ... be open with our users with what we are doing,” Hulls said, “and give them control.” The Life360 app defaults to consenting to sell user data and would need users to opt out within the app settings to prevent sharing of their personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AprTLJ"&gt;While announcing the acquisition, which will maintain Tile as an independent entity led by current CEO CJ Prober, Hulls described plans for the companies to connect Tile accounts to the Life360 app. During our conversation, he said that the APIs could allow customers to combine all family members (including pets, via another recent acquisition, Jiobit) and their stuff in one interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="lgeq5C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today begins a new chapter in Life360’s history.  I’m excited to announce Life360 is acquiring &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTileApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@thetileapp&lt;/a&gt;. This marks an incredible moment in our vision of being the world’s leading platform for safety and location services. Welcome to the team Tile! &lt;a href="https://t.co/q3uDFJiiGS"&gt;https://t.co/q3uDFJiiGS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Hulls (@ChrisHulls) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisHulls/status/1462938228512624640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8Nlxa"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, Life360 generated almost $700,000 from selling location data in 2016. This would later become a more integral revenue stream for the company. In a conversation with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, CEO Chris Hulls confirmed it brought in about $16 million in 2020, even as the company reported an overall &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21109082-life360-2020-financial-records#document/p39/a2066528"&gt;loss of $16.3 million last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZH5vaQ"&gt;A Tile representative responded to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about how the deal potentially affects data from its Bluetooth (and, eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022"&gt;ultra wideband&lt;/a&gt;) trackers: “Tile does not sell/monetize personal data and we have Life360’s full support and commitment to continue that.” Hulls told T&lt;em&gt;he Markup&lt;/em&gt; there are currently no plans to sell Tile’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0jQFq"&gt;Companies in the location data industry like Cuebiq, X-Mode, SafeGraph, and Allstate’s Arity all pay for access to Life360’s customer tracking. A former Cuebiq employee quoted in the report “joked” that their former employer would not be able to operate its marketing campaign without Life360 data. A former X-Mode employee said Life360 had the “most valuable offerings due to the sheer volume and precision” compared to other sources of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ioyE8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; asked Hulls about the claim that his company is the largest hub for the phone location tracking industry; he responded, “We have no means to confirm or deny the accuracy.” Hulls also told &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; that Life360 does not share information with government entities — but once the data is purchased, “We cannot comment on the practices of another company or what that company does with data it receives from other sources.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTpnHw"&gt;Hulls continued in the email response to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; saying Life360 prohibits tracing back information to individual customers in its contracts with data purchasers. Hulls says he is also not aware of any instance where a customer was re-identified, stating Life360 follows privacy practices that are “industry best.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KVVQCZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Data brokers] depend on people not understanding where things are coming from, where they’re going, where they’re actually getting their data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ZKMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; also spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/bennett-cyphers"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff technologist Bennett Cyphers&lt;/a&gt;, who pointed out that very few apps disclose what companies they’re actually sharing data with because they’re not legally required to do so. It’s not only that the apps aren’t telling users where their data is going, and the companies that pass the data on refuse to tell their customers how it was obtained. As he put it, “Especially the ones [data brokers] that deal in location data, they consider the apps that they collect data from to be trade secrets, and they won’t reveal that to anyone, in response to anything.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1zlvq"&gt;Based on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests on situations where the government has obtained location data from a broker, in every case the EFF has seen, the government has no idea where the data is coming from. “Secrecy is these companies bread and butter, they cannot exist out in the sunlight. They depend on people not understanding where things are coming from, where they’re going, where they’re actually getting their data,” says Cypher about the information brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Z1JxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google bans tracking tool that sold users’ location data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621685/google-ban-safegraph-android-user-data-location-tracking"},{"title":"Secret Service bought access to cellphone location data ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371886/secret-service-usss-locate-x-babel-street-foia-contract-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DpBIeM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life360’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.life360.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043228154-Full-Privacy-Policy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;full privacy policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; states:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AwRXzh"&gt;We may share your personal information, including your precise location data, driving sensor data, unique identifiers or AD IDs and other data with our partners, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/privacypolicy"&gt;Cuebiq&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/trusted-partners/%20"&gt;Partners&lt;/a&gt;, for their marketing and business purposes, including without limitation, to inform and improve tailored advertising, attribution, analytics or research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MEIMKD"&gt;When I spoke to Hulls, he said there’s a list of companies that can purchase data from Life360 and that directly identifiable info — such as names and emails — is stripped out. This data is then put on a server that allows permissible companies to further process it and then distribute it to other parties. “No one can just buy someones’ random data,” Hulls said. Life360 also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Funderstanding-how-life360-uses-and-protects-your-data%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22820381%2Ftile-life360-location-tracking-data-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;keeps a blog&lt;/a&gt; on its site where it states about 90 percent of its customers are using the “free application experience” and explains how some services are kept free by subsidizing revenues from location and ad data sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yXB3uK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“if we found that the average user had a problem with it, we would re-evaluate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlZc09"&gt;Hulls feels that Life360 providing precise location data equates to the workings of targeted ads and how the industry as a whole, down to media sites like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is doing this. An example he gave was the &lt;em&gt;New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; using “aggregated phone exhaust data.” Hulls is confident that the services Life360 provides in exchange for data are valuable and compared his company to Credit Karma. From his perspective, “They take what’s pretty personal information, they’ve established trust that’s okay, they take your social, your billing, whatever, they give you credit card offers ... we want to do the same with insurance in a very transparent way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIQalv"&gt;In response to the anonymization of location data, Cyphers pointed out that anonymization is a “meaningless buzzword” in terms of location privacy, where simply slapping a device ID on information isn’t enough to separate it from a real person. The phone that stays where you sleep at night, then follows you to your workplace in the morning, and spends weekends at the places you hang out, is unlikely to belong to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc9mnm"&gt;In comparison to services like Credit Karma or insurers that have launched tracking apps or devices, Cyphers pointed out that people join Credit Karma frequently with the “sole intent” of finding a credit card or loan. Signing up for a family safety app, they may not be aware of how much money is changing hands, how much data is being collected, and how those goals could be misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyBuIL"&gt;We asked Hulls if he thinks Life360 has competitors that have not been similarly scrutinized: “I’m not here to call anyone out but am highlighting that the positioning of us as some giant shadow player is simply wrong,” he wrote in an email response. Hulls also says he believes customers are not worried, and that “if we found that the average user had a problem with it, we would re-evaluate, but we haven’t had users complain about it in any meaningful sense.” In a follow-up email asking if users have reported they were unaware of how their data is used and shared, he says, “Less than .1 percent of our inbound customer support emails mention data whatsoever, and most of the ones that come in ask technical questions about our opt-out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jjvhCs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brokered cell location data led to the outing and resignation of a Catholic official ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eia7bW"&gt;Hulls did say there is “theoretically” enough data available in what Life360 sells to identify individuals, but that to the company’s knowledge it has never happened. He cited the belief that companies would casually break their contract and break the law as possible, theoretically, but frustrating to him as an idea because he thinks “it’s a pretty big step that most reputable companies are not going to do.” We asked what would happen if contracted purchasers like X-Mode are confirmed to have sold data identifiable data to the government, and while Hulls would not confirm active investigations, he says it would sue partner companies that breach the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66EHyF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;’s report on the &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data"&gt;location data industry&lt;/a&gt; helps paint the picture of how the demand for user data is seen as an opportunity by companies like Life360. Hulls stated to &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; that selling location data is “an important part of our business model that allows us to keep the core Life360 services free” — citing that its features have “improved driver safety and saved numerous lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1639072537.156400"&gt;While Life360 is a safety company selling peace of mind and perhaps a better offer on your insurance, it’s also like many other companies (Google, Facebook, Roku, and Vizio come to mind) where mining the data generated by users could ultimately be more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJqILI"&gt;Though both the company and Tile delivered statements that there are no &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; plans to sell Tile tracker data, real-time location information is sensitive enough that simply trusting anyone to keep it out of the wrong hands is a hard sell. Even with the ability to opt out after registering, rushed decisions to get through the signup process fast could determine who actually owns your information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch The Game Awards 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N2YDsGO6dQOKfLZfVR-SDyO6n1M=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251164/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbQOlO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/"&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; are back. The awards ceremony / game conference / concert hosted by Geoff Keighley will deliver a couple hours’ worth of performances (notably, Sting will be playing), game reveals (one of which is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1464812686244401153?s=20"&gt;over two years in the making&lt;/a&gt;), and almost certainly, a few new memes. There have been very few teases as to what we’ll see onstage, but don’t take that as any indication that this could be a quiet show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1THRf"&gt;A few years ago, this is where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console"&gt;the debut of the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; was an unexpected surprise. I wouldn’t expect any game console announcements for this year’s show. What you can expect (even if you’d rather avoid it) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820270/the-game-awards-red-carpet-core-metaverse"&gt;are some metaverse happenings&lt;/a&gt; that aim to give you a more immersive way to experience the Game Awards. Speaking of topical issues, Geoff Keighley has stated that the Game Awards won’t feature NFTs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817651/activision-blizzard-the-game-awards-harassment"&gt;nor will Activision Blizzard play any role in the show&lt;/a&gt; beyond its nominated titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M75GxQ"&gt;When are The Game Awards 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VOlLAW"&gt;The Game Awards will air live on Thursday, December 9th at 8PM ET / 5PM PT / 1AM GMT. That’s late for our friends in Europe, but if you’re in Japan, you’ll get to watch it first thing in the morning at 9AM. There will be a pre-show beginning a half-hour earlier than the times above, if you want to tune in then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FHn8uM"&gt;How can I watch The Game Awards 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fh5YVs"&gt;Look no further than the top of this page, where we’re hosting a livestream of The Game Awards from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/thegameawards"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (the stream will automatically go live for the 7:30PM ET pre-show). However, there are some other sites hosting it, including &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameawards"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Looks like Louis Vuitton is planning to launch another smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Leaked images of the rumored new Louis Vuitton watch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vODRCJiiATtXfKHrdaS7AvVTlfw=/133x0:1471x892/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70251056/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_1.36.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like the name suggests, it lights up&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gadgets and Wearables, Louis Vuitton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gk1ivs"&gt;It appears that Louis Vuitton is launching yet another version of its Tambour Horizon Connected Watches. According to &lt;a href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2021/12/09/louis-vuitton-tambour-horizon-light-up/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gadgets and Wearables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this one lights up thanks to 24 LED lights. It’s not dissimilar to Louis Vuitton’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583644/louis-vuitton-horizon-light-up-speaker-design-price-release-date"&gt;bizarre $2,890 light-up speaker&lt;/a&gt; that looks like it belongs in a space opera. There’s a lot that could be written about this thing, from its ostentatious design to its simple feature set. But the big thing to note here is the watch may purportedly forgo Wear OS in favor of a proprietary operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUbmRz7k9C16-0H0BkJCas8_t58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076377/Screen_Shot_2021_12_09_at_1.20.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Victoria Song&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Several reports of the announcement have been taken down or redirect to other content, but remain in Google News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CCf1Bm"&gt;Several other outlets initially ran the announcement, including &lt;em&gt;HypeBeast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;HypeBae&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wareable&lt;/em&gt;, but have since been taken down or now redirect to other pages. Details on the actual hardware and software were vague, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Louis Vuitton and its parent company LVMH, which confirmed the watch existed but didn’t provide further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFxyV4"&gt;So far, there’s no name for this custom-built OS. All that’s been reported is that it’s got a touchscreen and a swipe-based UI. Swiping in various directions supposedly brings up notifications, metrics, settings, and, in an interesting twist, a “My Travel” screen that stores plans and boarding passes. Given that this would be an haute couture smartwatch, there would also be customizable watch face options and fairly basic health tracking. The other odd, but perhaps telling, tidbit is that the proprietary OS was “made for iPhone” but also described as Android and HarmonyOS compatible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzU63B"&gt;If true, this wouldn’t be the first time a traditionally Wear OS smartwatch line quietly pivoted away from the platform. The recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787071/wearos-moto-watch-100-smartwatches"&gt;Moto Watch 100&lt;/a&gt; also decided to run proprietary software called Moto OS — even though Motorola-branded smartwatches have historically run on Wear OS. Earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463529/huawei-watch-3-pro-harmonyos-smartwatch-features-specs"&gt;Huawei Watch 3&lt;/a&gt; and the OnePlus Watch also decided to gamble on their own RTOS-based software. It’s too early to say whether this trend will last, but it hints that Wear OS’s growing pains may just be beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfweRI"&gt;It was monumental news when Google announced it was partnering with Samsung to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;create a new unified platform&lt;/a&gt; that mashed together the best of Wear OS and Tizen OS. But while it was an opportunity to unify the fragmented Android wearable space, there were a lot of caveats, too. For starters, Wear OS 3 won’t arrive for eligible smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;until mid-2022 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;. Keyword: Eligible. Based on Google’s official guidance and announcements from partners like Fossil, it’s pretty clear that Android smartwatches powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 chips won’t make the cut. That’s a massive hardware dilemma, as only a handful use the current Snapdragon Wear 4100 platform. It’s also troubling, considering it wasn’t until this past summer that Qualcomm seemingly realized it’d dropped the ball and announced it was working on a new wearable chipset. Basically, Wear OS still has a hardware problem. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWD8X4BlkDAelNO5q4BciGdBrFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8831969/louis_vuitton_tambour_horizon_black_42_jewellery_and_timepieces__QAAA25_PM2_Front_view.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Louis Vuitton&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Louis Vuitton’s first smartwatch, the Tambour Horizon launched in 2017, ran Google’s operating system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xkv7wT"&gt;Case in point: Wear OS 3 worked well on Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; lineup. Those smartwatches run on Samsung’s in-house &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/exynos/newsroom/pressrelease/samsung-introduces-the-industrys-first-5nm-processor-powering-the-next-generation-of-wearables/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Exynos W920 chip&lt;/a&gt;, which runs circles around both Snapdragon Wear 3100 and 4100. So, if you’re a non-Apple smartwatch maker, you’ve got two options. You could take Fossil’s route and build a 4100-powered watch that will eventually run Wear OS 3, though not as well as Samsung’s watches. You’d also have to hope that Qualcomm manages to quickly release a wearables chipset that isn’t based on incredibly outdated technology. Or, you could just bypass the headache altogether with a proprietary OS, at the expense of more advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VtM3E"&gt;The reality is, right now, Android users are left in a lurch with few appealing options. Switching to Wear OS 3 was always going to be messy, but there’s a lot of potential from what we’ve seen of Wear OS 3 on Samsung’s watches. However, Samsung is like Apple. Its products work best if you’re knee-deep in its ecosystem. Barring a Pixel or Fitbit Wear OS watch run by a powerful Google chip (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814461/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-2022-rohan"&gt;may actually happen&lt;/a&gt;), non-Samsung users are likely going to have to wait a while for an equivalent smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UL0fa"&gt;In the interim, it looks increasingly likely we’ll see more Android-friendly smartwatches running proprietary software. That’s not necessarily bad. The Fitbit Sense, Amazfit GTR 3 Pro, and Huawei Watch 3 are all examples of serviceable smartwatches that chose this route. Then again, so did the OnePlus Watch, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;that was a bug-ridden nightmare at launch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfeSkl"&gt;Essentially, it’s all up in the air. We won’t be able to confirm whether Wear OS will be missing from the new Louis Vuitton smartwatch until it officially launches. We also won’t know how Wear OS 3 will fare in the long run for quite some time. The only thing we can say with utmost certainty is don’t buy a new 3100-powered smartwatch. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="wufCfX"&gt;Last week, a Reddit user reported that they &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/"&gt;weren’t able to call 911 using their Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; and later said they were working with Google support to figure out the issue. Yesterday, Google &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/"&gt;announced what was causing the issue&lt;/a&gt; in a reply to the post: an “unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/08/android-emergency-calling-bug/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Auq1G4"&gt;In its comment, Google says that the bug happens when someone is using Android 10 or later and has Teams installed but isn’t logged into the app. The company says that Microsoft will be releasing an update to Teams “soon” to prevent the issue and that there’s an update to Android coming January 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vur50g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re running Android 10 or above and aren’t logged into Teams, uninstall it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvf9I"&gt;Needless to say, you should uninstall Teams until the update is available if you’re not planning on logging into the app. If you have logged into it at one point but don’t use it frequently, you should also go ahead and double-check that you’re still logged in as well. Even though the bug was reported on the Pixel subreddit, Google recommends that you should keep an eye out for the Teams update if you have “any Android device” running Android 10 or up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVGVP"&gt;As many commenters pointed out, it’s a bit concerning that any app can make it so you can’t contact emergency services. Google does say it’s only received one report about this bug, but it’s a pretty niche set of circumstances that cause the bug (there’s really no reason to have Teams installed if you’re not logged into it). If it had been a more common interaction, it could’ve really caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMzSr5"&gt;Google says it’ll update its Reddit comment when the Teams update is rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Utility companies will no longer share data with ICE — but many loopholes remain </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="87VqSj"&gt;A nationwide group of companies from the power, water, cable TV, and telecommunications sectors have agreed that they will no longer sell customer information to data brokers used by ICE and law enforcement agencies. The news has been hailed as an important step by privacy advocates, who have long criticized the practice as a privacy violation that lets law enforcement obtain personal information from third parties without appropriate review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZJwRJ"&gt;The announcement comes from a letter sent Wednesday by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/08/utility-data-government-tracking/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0rFOr"&gt;The companies concerned belong to the National Consumer Telecom &amp;amp; Utilities Exchange (NCTUE), a credit reporting agency that lets members log the payment histories of their customers in a shared central database. This data was then shared with credit bureau Equifax, which uses such payment information records in credit score reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kiOEO"&gt;However, the same data was then resold by Equifax to &lt;a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/clear-investigation-software"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/a&gt; — an extensive database of personal information that was used by ICE investigators, as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/26/ice-private-utility-data/"&gt;reported by the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZXIvw"&gt;According to the letter sent by Sen. Wyden, the NCTUE directed Equifax to stop selling data to CLEAR as of October 2021. However, any customer data in the database before this point will remain accessible and includes some information — such as dates of birth and Social Security numbers — that will not change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mw28R"&gt;Wyden’s letter asks the CFPB to prevent credit agencies from selling personal data to law enforcement agencies via data brokers — a practice that the senator has campaigned against for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc39wI"&gt;“Every branch of government has ignored the corrosive effect of data brokers for decades,” said Sen. Wyden in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Investigations by journalists, researchers and my office have finally shined a light on just how widespread the sale of Americans private data is. I’ve told anyone who will listen that Congress’s top tech priority should be passing strong legislation to protect Americans’ privacy and security. I hope Democrats don’t pass on the chance to put privacy protections into black letter law until it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0USFlj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No matter where this information is coming from, the police shouldn’t be able to buy their way around the constitution”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rrv9Tb"&gt;The use of data obtained from third-party brokers in law enforcement has drawn strong criticism from privacy advocates, since it effectively creates a loophole that lets agencies skirt processes of judicial review, such as the need to obtain a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVPMLL"&gt;“Part of why utility records are so insidious is that you can opt out of a lot of digital services, but it’s hard to opt out of having electricity or running water,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP). “To make those lifeline utilities yet another tracking tool for ICE put undocumented families in an intolerable position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igqzzZ"&gt;“No matter where this information is coming from, the police shouldn’t be able to buy their way around the constitution,” Cahn added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU3OXj"&gt;The CLEAR database, which is operated by media company Thomson Reuters, is currently subject to a &lt;a href="https://www.classlawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/Thomson-Reuters-CLEAR-class-action-lawsuit.pdf"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in California by STOP, Gibbs Law Group, Justice Catalyst Law, and Gupta Wessler PLLC. The lawsuit contends that the sale of information in the database violates the privacy of California residents. A motion to dismiss the lawsuit from Thomson Reuters was &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-advances-privacy-claims-over-reuters-database/"&gt;rejected by a judge in April&lt;/a&gt;. The case is currently at the discovery phase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new year-end live event, Escape2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ooGePdsoPo3VwWxLUToyJLwfQBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250714/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQqmJa"&gt;YouTube will host a 24-hour interactive live event featuring musicians and creators to look back on the platform’s biggest trends and videos of 2021, the company announced today. The event, called Escape2021, will have three chapters, the first of which begins on December 16th at midnight ET. The goal of Escape2021: liberate &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJRHqCRvD0c"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; from the confines of her bedroom and studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oSqOA"&gt;Escape2021 replaces YouTube Rewind, a high-production recap video YouTube published at the end of each year that had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;derided by creators&lt;/a&gt; for sanitizing the platform to appeal to advertisers. The company officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on Rewind in October, saying it would “refocus our energies” to create different kinds of productions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyDbmD"&gt;The event seems to be an attempt by YouTube to offer more immersive online experiences, like when fans watched &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bts-army-butter-melting-video-9564987/"&gt;butter melt&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a new BTS song. YouTube says there will be trivia questions, trend-based challenges, and “real-time live experiences,” all leading up to musical performances. One example of a challenge, echoing the BTS livestream, will require viewers to identify what butter sculptures the band has melted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASw5Bl"&gt;YouTube says the event will include performances and appearances from BTS, Doja Cat, and Mark Rober, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
