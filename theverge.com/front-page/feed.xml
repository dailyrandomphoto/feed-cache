    <title>YouTube has terminated five Myanmar military-run channels as political unrest continues</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="70Efte"&gt;YouTube terminated five Myanmar military channels from its platform on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-youtube/youtube-removes-five-myanmar-tv-channels-from-platform-idUSKBN2AX0BQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The removals include YouTube channels for the government-run Myanma Radio and Television (MRTV) network and the military-owned Myawaddy Media used to spread military propaganda in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kkn82D"&gt;YouTube’s action is the platform’s first major intervention following &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;the military coup that was staged in February&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent military crackdowns against protesters that have left &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/myanmar-military-coup-deaths/2021/03/03/076de674-7c85-11eb-8c5e-32e47b42b51b_story.html"&gt;at least 38 dead&lt;/a&gt;. “We have terminated a number of channels and removed several videos from YouTube in accordance with our community guidelines and applicable laws,” a YouTube spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Prior to the coup, the company also terminated 34 channels used as “influence operations” during Myanmar’s election in 2020, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY0XDC"&gt;Facebook has also attempted to limit the military’s influence, banning all military pages on its platforms in February and cutting off the organization’s access to ads on the platform, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/technology/facebook-myanmar-ban.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;the military banned Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and has drastically limited access to all social networks by enacting regular internet curfews across the country since the coup began, &lt;a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-myanmar-amid-apparent-military-uprising-JBZrmlB6"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NetBlocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s more active response to the military’s actions could be seen as a direct result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;the criticism the social network received&lt;/a&gt; for its role in the genocidal violence that occurred in Myanmar in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohn6d5"&gt;YouTube’s bans surely haven’t addressed all pro-military propaganda on the platform, but they show a willingness to intervene as protests against the military junta continue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Silicon Valley school is using virtual escape rooms to evaluate prospective students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Six small dolls stand in a circle around a globe." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emXxfp2ukbnKiasU3kFFdK5fNAs=/743x180:1921x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68919154/TAPISW__00.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The logo on the escape room’s opening screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Paruzal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7mo6f6"&gt;Applying to an elite middle school sounds like a stressful experience, and I’m sure COVID-19 doesn’t help. With things like open houses, campus tours, and in-person interviews off the table, applicants have fewer chances to experience their prospective schools — and admissions offices have fewer chances to meet their prospective students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZaB7p"&gt;One San Jose private school has come up with a unique solution: The Harker School, &lt;a href="https://www.harker.org/about"&gt;self-described&lt;/a&gt; as “one of the nation’s top college prep schools,” is putting teams of sixth grade applicants through a virtual escape room. Over a Zoom call, the 11-year-olds work together to solve a series of Harker-themed puzzles, and admissions officers observe their behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW0GU4"&gt;Harker let me go through the game myself, alongside a friend of mine who’s an experienced escape room artist. I imagine that, to an 11-year-old, the process may have been stressful and somewhat dystopian. But for me, a grown-up, it was a heck of a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPMJmy"&gt;The game came from a collaboration between Harker and &lt;a href="https://paruzal.com/"&gt;Paruzal&lt;/a&gt;, a Denver-based company that specializes in live-hosted online escape rooms. &lt;a href="https://paruzal.com/episodes"&gt;Paruzal’s games&lt;/a&gt; take place in all kinds of settings, from Bruce Springsteen concerts to coffee shops and pizzerias, with high stakes, including “Can you find the backup coffee beans before the food critic arrives?” “Will you be able to build the bobblehead to unlock your office door on time?” and “Will you get to meet Bruce Springsteen in his dressing room before the journalist arrives and interrupts you?” They’re low-tech operations, though: a Zoom call, a series of PowerPoint-esque slides, and a game master who leads the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmL8V"&gt;Harker isn’t the first institution to turn to pared-down online puzzles as an educational tool. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324558/google-forms-virtual-escape-rooms-librarians-games-puzzles-homeschooling"&gt;Escape rooms built from Google Forms&lt;/a&gt; have been popular among teachers and librarians since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the sort of exercise ready-made for assessing teamwork and problem-solving skills, as well as engaging kids who are stuck at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leKWsQ"&gt;The sixth grade game, called “The Annual Picnic,” was designed to evaluate how a student thinks on their feet. “There’s really no good way to practice playing a game,” says James Warner, Paruzal’s owner. “You’re really showing more of your true self.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A handwritten note on a piece of lined paper reads: “Dear Sixth Graders, You must be wondering where all your stuff is. We didn’t want anyone else taking it, so we hid it. But we forgot the lock combinations, sorry. Everything’s in the lockers, and we’re sure you’ll have no problem solving the puzzles. Good luck!” At the bottom are four signatures." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6CEqRSX9yaKXPBYeR2THtfvPJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346223/TAPISW_09.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paruzal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Sports commentator voice* It begins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ymKoct"&gt;The scenario was as follows: we were put in the shoes of Harker School sixth graders setting up a booth for the school’s annual picnic. (This is a real event Harker puts on every year. As described, it sounds like a massive operation that my public middle school could not have pulled off in its wildest dreams.) The supplies necessary to construct this booth were locked in some lockers, however, and the combinations were hidden in various parts of Harker’s library. To “escape” from the library, we had to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiKj45"&gt;My teammate and I began our search. We were shown crudely drawn locations like a desk, a fridge, and a bookcase. We quibbled between ourselves over which location to investigate, then informed the game master of our decision. He swapped to the appropriate slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXvhQz"&gt;In this manner, we embarked on our quest across the library, finding the combinations we sought in chocolate chip cookies, sausages, old recipes, cryptic posters, and other various items. One puzzle involved some arithmetic on the number of pages in a stack of books. A jar contained cookies with varying numbers of chips, which led us to another combination. Some of the puzzles were busywork; a picture of a bunch of owls that hung on the wall ended up being a Morse Code message that we had to grind out. Others were legitimately tricky; we spent several minutes agonizing over what to do with a bag of sausages before realizing we should tell the game master to open the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CGF1r"&gt;My teammate and I finished Harker’s escape room in just under 30 minutes. Teams of applicants average around 33 minutes — so we did beat the average 11-year-old, although not by a lot. (In our defense, my ego wouldn’t allow me to ask for too many hints. They’re technically unlimited in Harker’s game. Game masters also have strategies for speeding the kids along. “We have some say in how long the game is based on how forcefully I recommend that they ask for a hint,” says Warner.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ic891"&gt;Based on our score, Warner believes my teammate and I would be strong candidates for Harker’s sixth grade class. (He noted that while I seemed like more of a leader, my teammate had more useful ideas. Fair enough!) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A list of 16 books with the surnames of their authors printed on parchment. Books include: Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury; And Then There Were None, Christie; A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens; The Three Musketeers, Dumas; One Hundred Years of Solitude, Garcia Marquez; Seven Years in Tibet, Harrer; The House of the Seven Gables, Hawthorne; Catch-22, Heller; One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Kesey; The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, McCall Smith; 1984, Orwell." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NtANpKDIFFkpeaOtpeYNQRRpZO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346225/TAPISW_23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paruzal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We had to add and subtract some of the numbers in these titles to get one of the combinations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FDjZtZ"&gt;Of course, the score isn’t the only factor. Were we Harker applicants, admissions officers would have been watching our interactions closely. “You take notes on the various performances to identify a student that screams at one of their counterparts in the game, or maybe there’s somebody who’s building consensus,” Warner says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAbwqW"&gt;There are also some Easter eggs built into the game that can help differentiate students with sophisticated knowledge. One of the locker combinations was “24601” — “Ah, &lt;em&gt;Les Mis&lt;/em&gt;,” I remarked upon discovery. That’s apparently something Harker is watching for. “It’s a way to help the staff ... get a feel for how broad an applicant’s experience is,” Warner says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Four pictures on a gray background: a stack of four small lockers, an Indian flag, a padlock, and a plate of Indian food including bread, rice, and sauces. Arrows point from the lockers to the padlock, and from the padlock to the food." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtNcTPn2iopFT3_9XSemZyjO0Wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347850/TAPISW_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paruzal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We saw this screen when we opened our first locker. It contained Indian food, which we’d be serving at our picnic booth. Typing this is making me hungry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TkSVB"&gt;The escape room I completed has been retired — the next batch of applicants will get a different one — but Paruzal plans to keep the game on the backburner as a tool, even as in-person interviewing eventually resumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3i3SD"&gt;In some ways, Harker’s game replicates aspects of the pre-pandemic admissions process — the campus tour, the open house. “Before the pandemic, I know some [secondary schools] would observe students in a group setting when they were doing a visit to see how they reacted,” says admissions expert Eric Nichols, VP for Enrollment Management at Loyola University Maryland. “That’s why they’re doing the virtual escape room: the chance to observe students to see how they react to a situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skYMFK"&gt;But some of the quirks we displayed during our game strike me as traits that would be difficult to draw out through even the traditional pre-pandemic process. I’ll admit that when I conceive of a Silicon Valley private school seeking diplomatic sixth graders with knowledge of 19th century French literature, I’m tempted to roll my eyes. But within an application file of grades, standardized test scores, and other sorts of metrics that can be gamed with camps and tutors, perhaps escape room acumen could help exceptional students without exceptional numbers stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkj9I1"&gt;“Nothing’s going to replace grades, but for students who are on the borderline academically, those softer skills can help an admission office decide who they might want to take a chance on,” Nichols says. “It puts everyone on an equal playing field.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lo-fi remixes of video game music is my new favorite genre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVAez45sPQuDyJzu9E9CvgQgULc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918894/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_9.46.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rifti Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Frxvc"&gt;I don’t usually work with any music — it often distracts me — but recently, when I’ve needed a little music on in the background, I’ve become obsessed with lo-fi remixes of video game music on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7sIti"&gt;I’ve already gone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21373558/music-video-ebooks-tv-favorites-work-from-home"&gt;on record&lt;/a&gt; that I sometimes listen to video game music while working because a) I’m a huge nerd, and b) a lot of video game music is already designed to be pleasant background noise that can loop endlessly without becoming annoying. It wouldn’t be all that much fun spending hours upon hours in the worlds of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;if the music was always in-your-face and distracting, after all. (I will give &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/aEezCi7ucf4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Ruby &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Sapphire&lt;/em&gt;’s hilariously prominent horns&lt;/a&gt; a pass here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giREIB"&gt;It makes sense, then, that the infinitely listenable quality of video game music, much of which has become seared to my brain after days spent in virtual worlds, combines really well with the soft electronic sounds of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/how-lo-fi-artists-make-music-perfect-for-work-or-studying-or-chilling/2020/02/18/c88bf92e-49e4-11ea-bdbf-1dfb23249293_story.html"&gt;lo-fi chillhop beats&lt;/a&gt;, which I can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; listen to for hours on end. Now, I’m hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpkCxO"&gt;Here are a few remixes I recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5ka0h"&gt;If you’re a fan of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;’s amazing soundtrack, I think you’ll dig &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0nBYI0owpeY"&gt;this set of remixes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_oKJrJsH3c-N5xixPrP3w"&gt;Rifti Beats&lt;/a&gt;. I think I go back to this video more than any other. (And there’s a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QR_HmidODnM"&gt;part two&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wDxKl3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nBYI0owpeY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FmWRXm"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rJlY1uKL87k"&gt;Zelda &amp;amp; Chill 2&lt;/a&gt;” from GameChops puts a fantastic spin on some classic &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; tunes. (The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rJlY1uKL87k?t=1696"&gt;“Midna’s Lament” remix&lt;/a&gt; is so, so good.) If you like what you hear, you might want to listen to the original “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GdzrrWA8e7A"&gt;Zelda &amp;amp; Chill&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHbKpZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rJlY1uKL87k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDp554"&gt;I recently beat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14875244/nier-automata-review-ps4-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I couldn’t get the game’s incredible music out of my head. I’ve recently turned to this remix of two of the game’s best songs — the city ruins theme and the amusement park theme — &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sLcyubcdruw"&gt;from Alex Moukala&lt;/a&gt; (a name you might recognize as the originator of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297388/wii-mii-channel-music-funky-remix-alex-moukala"&gt;funky remixes of the Wii’s Mii Channel&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1RxvUy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLcyubcdruw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ztfg7f"&gt;If you’re familiar with the &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; series’s very good music, you might want to give &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/veAtNhoIRoQ"&gt;this set of remixes from Courtar&lt;/a&gt; a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BAOaPo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/veAtNhoIRoQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i0Ss9F"&gt;And if you don’t want to sort through the many mixes available on YouTube, just turn on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FjAo1SjoQs"&gt;GameChops’ Video Game Study Lounge live stream&lt;/a&gt;. (In a spooky coincidence, I opened it to grab the link, and it was playing that “Midna’s Lament” remix I mentioned earlier. The song is just that good!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pv0vOf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FjAo1SjoQs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KExhvo"&gt;Happy listening. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters"&gt;tweet at me&lt;/a&gt; with any recommendations you have!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hades almost starred its worst character</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWI865"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, the legendary Greek hero who killed the Minotaur, Theseus, is a pain in the ass. He’s a bossfight, a blowhard who treats each encounter like an overproduced wrestling match. Zagreus, the cool, collected prince of the Underworld, may have good reason to want to leave, but in Theseus’ eyes, he’ll never amount to more than hellspawn. This dynamic helped highlight just what made Zagreus, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;’ protagonist, a fan-favorite. But in early versions of the game, Theseus’ role was reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89E1Ka"&gt;Theseus is hero material in legend only, a sentiment that developer Supergiant Games eventually came to share. During a recent talk on Clubhouse, Supergiant co-founder Amir Rao said that early concepts for &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; starred Theseus. It was creative director Greg Kasavin who flipped the &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; pitch into the award-winning game it is today. “He sort of had this idea that we could probably keep everything in the game, but recast it as Zagreus,” Rao said. “These different ideas, all these different characters, they all kind of came together. Within I think a day or two he had convinced everyone that it was a better idea.”  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early concept art for Theseus as the game’s hero.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="efwy65"&gt;In the early days of development,&lt;em&gt; Hades&lt;/em&gt; — then referred to as “Minos” — followed Theseus as he explored the labyrinth of Crete. The roguelike would have capitalized on the twisting nature of the labyrinth to pull off its limitless dungeons. Kasavin tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Supergiant wanted to play with the many variations of the Theseus myth as part of the game. “The idea was going to be like each time you play, it’s kind of like a different retelling of the Theseus myth,” he says. Despite going through several iterations, the team felt like they couldn’t get a solid grip on who Theseus was as a hero. “So kind of cerebrally, he was interesting,” Kasavin says. “But when we were trying to bring him to life as a protagonist, he has this risk of being kind of very generic. But as soon as we start adding specific detail to him, he just doesn’t really feel like Theseus anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o5FZJvEwCEayT2b8pK1IFBHswWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348500/Artemis.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concept art featuring Theseus with Artemis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFF3Cg"&gt;Not only that, but the game just felt too grim, Kasavin says. When the team took their holiday break, Kasavin kept researching. He eventually stumbled across myths about Zagreus, Hades’ son. Something clicked. “It turns out that there are not a lot of myths about Hades, apparently, because the Greeks were just afraid of him,” Kasavin says. “So they didn’t talk about him ... It’s like, wait a minute. Hades is one of these super iconic like household name level, Greek gods. And yet there’s so few stories about him and he has a son?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7Jm2m"&gt;Kasavin pitched the idea to Rao; it allowed them to rewrite their story into something more exciting but keep many core parts of the game. “We just found a better sort of angle on the protagonist, on the overall theme and on the storytelling technique as well in that one swoop,” he says. “Things actually did come together pretty quickly from there.” It also lightened the tone of the game, taking a grim retelling of myths, and recasting it as a lighter tale about a very powerful, very dysfunctional family — one where everyone is a little petty, no one ever really dies, and Cerberus, the fearful hound of hell, is just the family dog. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yz8nS30ImKLttY-RB-wLLzF6ghc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348516/Dude_iso_04.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iterations of Zagreus next to Theseus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vzVou4"&gt;As for Theseus, he too got a rewrite from a boring hero into a showboating villain. Kasavin says that his return to the game was “not a foregone conclusion by any means,” but that allowed the team to play with his character more. “The part where he is bratty is something that I feel is kind of deeply rooted in the mythology about him,” Kasavin says. “He’s considered a hero, but some of the actions he takes are highly questionable.” In death, he’s a little more self-aware, paving the way for &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; to cast Theseus and Asterius as a tag-team, a pair of Luchadors from beyond the grave. “Theseus has the presence of mind in the underworld to acknowledge that his own fame, his own heroism is linked to his encounter with the Minotaur,” he says. “And he finds the Minotaur in death and he’s like, Oh, you were my greatest opponent. You were awesome.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OON5Lv"&gt;Against Zagreus, Kasavin says, Theseus is a self-righteous, single-minded hero who won’t listen to anyone. He’s overconfident and even obnoxious in every aspect of his personality, with one exception: “If he has one redeeming quality it’s that his friendship with Asterius is sincere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ID6z0S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus is a powerful nostalgia machine, but it doesn’t feel necessary yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tU_vW-Gmn0wM-l7dSIy2dfqxIi8=/191x0:2084x1262/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918278/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.28.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLkF2l"&gt;&lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/984581/3065?subId1=VergeParamountPlusNostalgia030521%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; is maybe one of the best streaming services for people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s who are looking to get nostalgic about the television of their youth. Outside of that, Paramount Plus is a bit of a head-scratcher. There certainly seems to be a bunch to choose from, but with missing seasons, incomplete film collections, and no immediate “must watch” TV or movie options, the question is still why would anyone sign up for this right now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNYdyB"&gt;The good thing is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ positives are hard to deny, but most of those positives fall on the TV side. As someone in their late 20s who grew up on a hearty breakfast of Nickelodeon shows, MTV reality series, and crime procedurals, Paramount Plus has everything I would have wanted a decade ago. Last night, I watched a bit of &lt;em&gt;All That&lt;/em&gt; before starting up &lt;em&gt;Jersey Shore &lt;/em&gt;again and ended the night with some &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;. A total blast! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvFj6DuFheQc42ew2Zmi4Vb81Qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348220/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.15.06_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="enmLBU"&gt;Whereas CBS All Access was restrained in its offerings, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; takes full advantage of Viacom’s library. Instead of having to choose from a medley of cop shows, classic television, films people may have forgotten about, and various&lt;em&gt; Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; installments, there are classic BET and MTV shows, Comedy Central specials, and Nickelodeon collections on top of what CBS All Access already offered (like next-day episodes). Paramount Plus is peak snackable TV, comfort shows that can be tossed on before bed, in the background, or when the nostalgic urge returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQEl7v"&gt;While Paramount Plus’ library is what stands out, there are issues. Full seasons of shows and installments in film franchises are missing. &lt;em&gt;Rocket Power &lt;/em&gt;only has one season available, &lt;em&gt;CSI &lt;/em&gt;made the first, second, and 15th seasons available, &lt;em&gt;FBI &lt;/em&gt;only has the third season, and several seasons of &lt;em&gt;All That &lt;/em&gt;are gone. On the film side, sequels to movies like &lt;em&gt;Grease, Bad News Bears, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Charlie’s Angels &lt;/em&gt;are available but not the first movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08CwuC"&gt;I would imagine this comes down to rights agreements (remember, ViacomCBS shows are also on Netflix, Peacock, and Hulu), but it’s something that came up for me a few times to the point it was noticeable for all the wrong reasons. Understandably, it’s a bit of a pain. But there are full seasons of shows like &lt;em&gt;Drake &amp;amp; Josh, Survivor, Criminal Minds, Cheers, Frasier, &lt;/em&gt;various &lt;em&gt;Star Trek &lt;/em&gt;seasons, and hundreds of other movies to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j61hFy"&gt;Content-wise, Paramount Plus’ biggest flaw is a staggering lack of exciting original series — even the selection of originals is several rows down on the homepage. Considering so many of these series are on other streamers — I can watch &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;iCarly &lt;/em&gt;either on Paramount Plus or Netflix — it’s hard to think of anyone beyond nostalgic 20- and 30-somethings signing up to scratch an itch. And even then, how many people are rushing to rewatch &lt;em&gt;Rugrats&lt;/em&gt; when they’re still making their way through a back catalog on Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cy8Idf"&gt;(For what it’s worth, it seems like ViacomCBS is aware of this, too, moving &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/a-quiet-place-2-release-date-moves-up-to-may-1234922520/"&gt;release date up to May&lt;/a&gt;. This means it will debut on Paramount Plus much earlier than anticipated and hopefully bring in a batch of new subscribers.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M69H1OnRD6IlCSkJBsOCpJ2zm2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348224/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.17.39_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="32BFaJ"&gt;The answer may lie in Paramount Plus’ live offerings. There are four specific live channels with the Premium ($9.99-a-month) plan: CBS local news, CBS News network (24/7), CBS Sports HQ, and ET Live. Since these are pulling feeds from live TV broadcasts, they include ads. I didn’t particularly care about using CBS Local News, CBS News, or ET Live since I can grab the majority of my news from reporters on Twitter, but Sports HQ is interesting. There isn’t any control over what game or sport you’re watching, but I found myself checking back in from time to time to see if it was anything interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgDT1m"&gt;The main problem is that it’s not a strong enough offering for sports fans who want access to every game (this is also the group of consumers who tend to hold onto their cable packages longest), and the news offering is relatively weak, too. If the idea is for a group of consumers to use Paramount Plus’ live channels as a replacement of sorts for cable — and I’m not sure that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the idea — it’s simply not enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BS8wIk"&gt;That’s content. But what about the actual platform itself? Like every streaming service, there are pros and cons, but I found the pros greatly outweighed the cons. Like HBO Max and Disney Plus, ViacomCBS makes it so people can browse via preferred network: BET, Nickelodeon, MTV, CBS, Comedy Central, and the Smithsonian Channel. This is key for someone like me who is primarily using Paramount Plus for Nickelodeon and MTV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfq1oz"&gt;Search tools are pretty accurate, and the subheadings within film and TV sections are plentiful. Switching from one episode to another while watching a show is pretty easy (simply scroll down and pick a new episode), and controls for rewinding or fast-forwarding are effortless. There are plenty of options for caption customization, including font, size, and background color. While a launch wouldn’t be a launch without some cons, the only big one I discovered was not being able to add a show or film to a watch list like Netflix allows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcSeneN1ptyJVkxH2pX7q42xXwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348230/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.19.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l13rOv"&gt;All in all, &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/984581/3065?subId1=VergeParamountPlusNostalgia030521%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty decent streaming service for $10 a month. When I feel the desire to rewatch &lt;em&gt;The Hills &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Jimmy Neutron, &lt;/em&gt;I’m sure I’ll return to it. But in a world where it’s so easy to cancel and sign back up for a service, I don’t see any real reason to keep Paramount Plus now when Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and Hulu fulfill so much of the same needs, but with new shows and films that I actively want to use the streaming services for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYOhR4"&gt;Maybe things will change when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7, A Quiet Place Part II, &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series become available to stream. For now, it’s a giant nostalgia machine that I’m glad exists, but I don’t feel like I need to add it to my monthly bill cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sNM88"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Jay Peters? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzjJVtEToH8cmyxn7XEX72FBRBk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918189/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How he adjusts the workspace to his needs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Wc3oae"&gt;The Verge lives on news, and Jay Peters is one of the news writers who keeps it going — searching out the latest info about what’s going on in technology, entertainment, and culture, and writing it up for the site. As with the rest of us, Jay has been doing most of his work from home over the last year — here’s how he manages it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtXYq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1wng0"&gt;I’m a news writer here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m fortunate to get to cover all sorts of things in tech, gaming, entertainment, and more. On any given day, I might write about things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22298495/pokemon-hardware-gadgets-pikachu-poke-ball-mini-camera-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; gadgets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299339/spider-man-movie-title-no-way-home-tom-holland"&gt;Marvel movie titles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins&lt;/a&gt;, or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982612/monopoly-longest-game-ever-edition-hasbro-trolling"&gt;Monopoly Longest Game Ever edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lw0e3Y"&gt;I had a bit of a roundabout path to this job. Out of college, I worked in technology PR, got my start writing about tech at &lt;a href="https://techmeme.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techmeme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8It11H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq831Q"&gt;Getting the setup to where it is now has taken years. I’ve experimented with different desks, mice, keyboards, laptop stands, monitor arms, and even at one point attached the Nintendo Switch dock to one of the legs of the desk using velcro. And I’m always tinkering with my setup, so anything I have set up now could change down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H20O2r"&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the desk is, it was a happy coincidence that my current apartment has a corner that’s the perfect size for this desk and the dresser (which holds things like game controllers and my notebook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlVoCN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What adjustments have you had to make for working at home and how do you deal with distractions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LaKJz"&gt;My wife and I have been working from home since 2017, so our physical work environments haven’t changed much due to the pandemic. Because we live in a studio, though, we have to communicate every day about our schedules and meetings so that we can avoid both being on the phone at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIIsTH"&gt;To keep out distractions, I usually just put in my AirPods Pro, without sound. That’s often enough to block things so I can stay focused. But if I need a little white noise, I turn on this extended YouTube video consisting entirely of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA"&gt;ambient engine noise from the USS Enterprise from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been my go-to for years. And when I feel like working to some music, I have been turning to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0nBYI0owpeY"&gt;lo-fi remixes of video game music&lt;/a&gt; as of late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4SDwZOUp3rACZ2kxJAEFgZvDRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347061/jpeters_210226_4457_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWcnWHktfRy_NtgLYHnVYywfnOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347074/jpeters_210226_4457_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jLjAkC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself, which I see is a sitting / standing desk. How did you choose it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ4z71"&gt;It’s a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fview%2Fid%2F233%2Fs%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo%2Fcategory%2F3%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully Jarvis standing desk&lt;/a&gt;. I used a sitting / standing desk at my PR job and got used to being able to switch back and forth, and standing makes me feel less lazy about being parked in front of a computer all day. I also find switching between sitting and standing relieves back pain and helps with a repetitive strain injury (RSI) in my wrists that first flared up a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEmnzy"&gt;One of the best add-ons I got for the desk was the programmable memory unit, which lets me tap a button to adjust the desk to my preferred sitting and standing positions. I also got the casters (wheels) so that I could wheel it over to my and my wife’s lounge chairs, which are right behind the desk. I can bring the desk over, adjust the monitor a bit lower, and then use it to watch movies and play video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gke2wF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you have less desktop space than most of the desks we’ve seen from your colleagues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esZcpp"&gt;Space is at a premium in my studio, so a smaller desk works better for me right now. I’m also fortunate that I can technically do my entire job with just a laptop, so I don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a bigger desk — though a keyboard, mouse, and monitor make it much easier! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8KMi0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting-looking desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="278I3C"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fchairs%2Fhag-capisco-chair.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Capisco Chair by HÅG&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought so, too, when I first saw it on Fully’s online store. I had no plans to buy it because of the price, which starts at $829. But I tried it out at the Fully showroom in Portland and it was my favorite chair there, so I sprung for it. Every single day, I’m glad that I did, since I can comfortably sit in it for hours and it helps a lot with my posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wsCwXH"&gt;
&lt;div id="V6qQSL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371531" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bh3IJJ"&gt;
&lt;p id="3IWtjE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KobMOI"&gt;I’ve got a new 13-inch MacBook Air with Apple’s custom M1 chip inside. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;It’s a fantastic machine&lt;/a&gt;. The only upgrade I added was 16GB of RAM. I didn’t add any onboard storage because the majority of my digital life is stored online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fK68T"&gt;The monitor is an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNDOO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VS228H-P with a 21.5-inch screen&lt;/a&gt;. My Amazon account tells me I bought this all the way back in 2015, but even though it’s old, I remain very happy with it. (I will admit that I thought this was a 24-inch screen for, uh, years.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCykmp"&gt;It’s attached to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078455485/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monitor mount from Huanuo&lt;/a&gt;, and I bought it because it was the tallest one I could find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7wSxQD"&gt;
&lt;div id="7l3USa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10349083" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NXzpJY"&gt;
&lt;p id="gP5TLb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting display setup. How did you decide on it? Does it work well for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5p4S1R"&gt;I use a single monitor because I get distracted too easily if I have more than one. I’d like to upgrade to something bigger or maybe even an ultrawide someday, though (especially now that I know I have a 21.5-inch monitor instead of a 24-inch one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSqIBS"&gt;The extremely tall monitor mount serves two purposes: it helps a lot with my posture and is highly adjustable, which means I can bring it to a lower height when I’m sitting in the chairs behind the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3SYS2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a little about the mouse you have to the right of your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mIPfn"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.contourdesign.com/product/unimouse/"&gt;Contour Unimouse&lt;/a&gt;. My wrists can hurt if I use a “flat” mouse for two long, so I spent a lot of time and money trying out different vertical mice to see which one was the best fit for me. I like the Unimouse a lot because of just how high it angles — the company’s website says it’s 70 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9tpAe"&gt;The mouse pad is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072C93TQL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VictSing Ergonomic Mouse Pad&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t remember why I picked it over others, but it works great for me and it’s cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ieiC33_m2Ij3HXVTrZYm9jUhWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347059/jpeters_210226_4457_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzULIS40j4oD8nJMgiRVlV0Gpj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347068/jpeters_210226_4457_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nT4SIW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re the second person I’ve seen who uses a split keyboard. Do you find it better than a traditional keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67oxdT"&gt;I do! It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle-Ergonomic-Mechanical-Programmable-Adjustable/dp/B07CX9KQRQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kinesis Freestyle Pro&lt;/a&gt; with the additional tenting accessories and wrist pads. I happily used the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop%2F8xk02kz6k69w%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for years, and also tried other ergonomic keyboards like the &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2-dvorak/"&gt;Kinesis Advantage2 QD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/"&gt;ErgoDox EZ&lt;/a&gt;. But the Freestyle Pro just feels the best to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMMkwP"&gt;I also like that I can program specific keys to macros. On the left side of my keyboard, you can see that I have crudely taped scraps of Post-It notes over some of the keys — those scraps are reminders of what I have programmed the keys to do, like Command + L to quickly highlight the link in the URL bar of my browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LRvHCG"&gt;
&lt;div id="g4whKL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371799" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eB4Ssr"&gt;
&lt;p id="oZcvCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2F70e"&gt;During the workday, my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; hardly ever leave my ears — they’re comfortable, sound fine, and work really well with my Mac and iPhone. I have just one criticism: unlike the original AirPods, the AirPods Pro tend to fall out when I’m talking on calls or eating. Hopefully Apple tweaks the fit of the AirPods Pro a little for the next model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTe2pE"&gt;My webcam is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C920-Pro-Webcam-Black/dp/B00829D0GM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 HD Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great and much better than my MacBook Air’s webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgaftI"&gt;My &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q9JXWTP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C hub is the Totu 13-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. It’s honestly overkill for my needs, but it works fine. Sometimes, though, it emits a dog whistle-pitched squeal that is really annoying. And the charging pad is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CHOETECH-Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Included/dp/B07THTPJFS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=chotech&amp;amp;qid=1614707259&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Choetech charging pad&lt;/a&gt;. It works well enough, though it charges my iPhone very slowly and sometimes requires me to shift my devices around a bit until their charging indicators turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu4nTB"&gt;To the left of my desk are my &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-digital-edition-console.3005817"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles%2Fxbox-series-x%23purchase#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/system/"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;. I have mostly only owned Nintendo consoles until recently, so I’ve been spending a lot of my pandemic free time catching up on older PlayStation and Xbox games on the PS5 and Series X. (I’m currently tearing my way through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493208/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-ps4-review-vanillaware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) They’re all sitting on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fmalm-2-drawer-chest-white-stained-oak-veneer-10178601%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IKEA Malm two-drawer chest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZg5V1"&gt;And throughout the day, I sip water from my trusty &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroflask.com%2F21-oz-standard-mouth-w-sport-cap%3Fcolor%3Dblack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hydro Flask water bottle&lt;/a&gt;. I swapped the cap for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083F0JKA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Klean Kanteen Sport cap&lt;/a&gt;, though, which I find leaks less than Hydro Flask’s sport cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DWMdce"&gt;
&lt;div id="S9hyEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10376102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e0NMs7"&gt;
&lt;p id="885Vop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you sent in the photos, you apologized for the cat hair on some of your devices. Tell us about the cat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc1Hvu"&gt;Meet Gouda! He’s an eight-year old exotic shorthair and his tongue never goes all the way inside his mouth. But don’t be fooled by his cuteness, he’s full of trouble. He enjoys knocking small objects off counters and waking my wife and me up thirty minutes before the alarm goes off. But we love him dearly anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John McAfee charged with securities fraud for ‘pump and dump’ cryptocurrency scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CUBA-US-POLITICS-MCAFEE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92YcU6XyRhrKxiigBkU2Burv5yM=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918121/1154007456.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read ADALBERTO ROQUE/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv7bld"&gt;John McAfee has been charged with securities fraud over a “pump and dump” cryptocurrency scheme. Federal prosecutors &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476.1.0.pdf"&gt;unsealed a case&lt;/a&gt; against McAfee and his executive advisor and bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/john-david-mcafee-and-executive-adviser-his-cryptocurrency-team-indicted-manhattan"&gt;claiming the pair&lt;/a&gt; earned nearly $2 million by urging Twitter followers to invest in cryptocurrencies like Reddcoin and Dogecoin, then selling off their own holdings as the price rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEgwgV"&gt;“McAfee and Watson exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception,” said US Attorney Audrey Strauss in a statement. “The defendants allegedly used McAfee’s Twitter account to publish messages to hundreds of thousands of his Twitter followers touting various cryptocurrencies through false and misleading statements to conceal their true, self-interested motives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqUjka"&gt;The pair allegedly ran their scheme between December 2017 to October 2018. McAfee used his verified Twitter account, which currently has around 1 million followers, to recommend a “Coin of the Day” or “Coin of the Week.” The indictment says McAfee claimed to have no stake in these altcoins; in reality, McAfee would allegedly buy large quantities beforehand using bitcoin, then offload them again after his followers had driven up the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m92He3"&gt;McAfee and Watson are facing seven charges, each count carrying between five and 20 years in prison. The criminal charges include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities and securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csmrQI"&gt;McAfee — known for founding the eponymous antivirus company — was already arrested last year on &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion"&gt;separate tax evasion charges&lt;/a&gt;. The Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-246"&gt;sued him in October&lt;/a&gt; for fraudulently promoting initial coin offerings or ICOs. And in 2019, a &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/john-mcafee-wont-pay-25m-judgment-in-wrongful-death-case-has-ignored-all-lawsuits-for-11-years/"&gt;court ordered him&lt;/a&gt; to pay $25 million for allegedly ordering the 2012 killing of his neighbor in Belize. (McAfee has denied involvement and refused to pay the funds.) These charges add yet another layer to his alleged crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtW8Row74mvxUTT5LZi-PgYw8mY=/0x0:2598x1732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917890/Bitwarden_iphone_android_display_blue.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our top pick is free to use across a range of operating systems on mobile and desktop.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bitwarden&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGzOfL"&gt;Using a password manager is one of the best steps you can take to protect your security online. A good password manager makes it easy to generate unique, strong passwords, and it will then securely save them so they’re available wherever you need them, whether that’s on your phone, laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Basically, they take 90 percent of the work out of being safe online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBbt6W"&gt;Hopefully, at this point everyone knows why it’s important to use a unique password for all of your accounts online. But the short version is that using one password everywhere means that if just one site you use gets hacked, an attacker potentially has the password that unlocks your entire online life. Breaches still matter if you use a password manager, but at that point it’s a case of resetting just one password rather than dozens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1thEs"&gt;Although different password managers have different selling points, most offer the same core set of features. They generate passwords which they securely store, and they’ll prompt you to save passwords when you use them on websites. They’ll also sync your passwords across devices and autofill them into websites and apps when required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh4HAn"&gt;There are many good password managers available that charge a monthly fee, but for this guide we’re going to be focusing on free services. All of them have paid subscription tiers, but for most, the free tier offers the essential core features of a password manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aNnmV"&gt;Our pick for the best for most people is Bitwarden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPU7Ha"&gt;The best for most people: Bitwarden&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KhFYyJhDEWLpdkTDgL_Oe3yCjxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347722/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_9.23.56_AM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGjqe"&gt;Bitwarden has basically everything you could want out of a password manager. It’s available across iOS and Android; it has native desktop applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux; and it also integrates with every major browser including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75mSmW"&gt;Bitwarden’s security has also been audited by a &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/third-party-security-audit/"&gt;third-party security company&lt;/a&gt;, and although it uses the cloud to sync your passwords between devices, it says it &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/security-faqs/#q-why-should-i-trust-bitwarden-with-my-passwords"&gt;stores them in an encrypted form&lt;/a&gt; that only you can unlock. You also have the option of protecting your Bitwarden account with two-factor authentication to provide an extra layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSnLRV"&gt;Importing our passwords was easy, and Bitwarden has guides for many popular password managers &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/import-data/"&gt;in its support pages&lt;/a&gt;. It supports biometric security on iOS and Android, and all of its software is nicely designed and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3LVJt"&gt;Bitwarden does have paid tiers, but we think most people will be able to do without most of the features they offer. Paying gets you access to encrypted file attachments, more second-factor security options, and reports on the overall security of the passwords you have in use. But even on the free tier, you can perform checks to see if individual passwords have been leaked in a password breach. Paying also gets you access to a built-in one-time code generator for two-factor authentication, but it’s easy and arguably more secure to use a separate app for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="adLPe6"&gt;
&lt;div id="v1bSwP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10374175" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="b5bYvK"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W4CLAh"&gt;Runner-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NINYyc"&gt;As part of our research, we also tried a variety of other password managers. Of these, Zoho Vault is another feature-packed free option, but its interface isn’t as good as Bitwarden’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TV0j4n"&gt;Zoho Vault&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/te5Nptg-a0LIJ9LVkmym530PCqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307342/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JsCPLN"&gt;Zoho Vault’s iOS and Android apps are nice enough, but its browser extension is a little clunky and buries useful features like its password generator behind one too many sub menus. It’s also unclear if the software has gone through a third-party security audit; the company didn’t respond to our query in time for publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HDhzhT"&gt;
&lt;div id="lvNPQw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10374191" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Sh7FnA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZVmKXa"&gt;Also-rans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EHSM1e"&gt;There were two other free password managers we felt weren’t up to Bitwarden and Zoho Vault’s standards. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Ffeature%2Fpassword-manager&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Norton Password Manager&lt;/a&gt; has the advantage of coming from a well-known cybersecurity company. But we found the way it attempts to simplify its setup process actually makes things more confusing, and Norton’s support pages didn’t do a great job at helping us work out where we’d gone wrong. Norton didn’t respond to our email asking whether the software has gone through a third-party security audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBHbtd"&gt;We also gave &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LogMeOnce&lt;/a&gt; a try, but we weren’t reassured by the presence of ads in its smartphone app. It also asked for many more permissions than the other password managers we tried. The company says this is necessary to enable its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2Fmugshot%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mugshot feature&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to give you information about unauthorized attempts to access your account, which is an optional feature. The company says it regularly hires third-party security researchers to test its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fAyOSv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Until recently, LastPass would have been included as a free password manager, but it’s making some changes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rtVzg"&gt;Until recently, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; would have been included as a free password manager, but it’s making some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;changes to its free tier&lt;/a&gt; on March 16th that mean it will be much less usable as a free password manager. After that date, free users will be able to view and manage passwords on just a single category of devices: mobile or computer. “Mobile” subscribers will have access to phones, tablets, and smartwatches, while “Computer” subscribers will be able to use the service across PCs, Macs, and browser extensions. Given how most people switch between these two classes of devices on a daily basis, we think this will severely limit how useful LastPass’ free tier will be for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWv32v"&gt;Our focus on simplicity also means we’ve excluded &lt;a href="https://keepass.info/"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;, a password manager that relies on third-party apps on non-Windows platforms. In addition, if you want to sync your passwords between devices, you have to use a third-party storage service such as Dropbox or Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zzjfrc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="G2WMgx"&gt;Beyond the free options, there’s a huge array of paid password managers out there. Some of these have free tiers, but they’re so restrictive that they’re effectively not usable as a day-to-day password manager. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://1password.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most well-known paid option, but others include &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordPass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.remembear.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RememBear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keepsolid.com%2Fpasswarden%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Passwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashlane.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roboform.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboForm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.enpass.io/"&gt;Enpass&lt;/a&gt;, all of which limit their free versions in ways that we think make them unsuitable for long-term use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4z8pE"&gt;Finally, most modern internet browsers offer built-in password management features, but we think it’s worth taking the time to store your passwords in a standalone service. It gives you more flexibility to switch platforms and browsers in the future, and password managers also generally have interfaces that are better suited to the task of storing passwords. To make things simpler for yourself, you might want to turn off the built-in password manager in your browser once you’ve picked a standalone version to use, so you don’t run the risk of having passwords stored in two places at once.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is popular at vaccination sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYDo2M9w5mF98CH3mK221IW8bmI=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917888/1231516410.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLP8LB"&gt;The messaging that all three authorized vaccines are good options appears to be sinking in around the country. When the first batch of single-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines arrived in States this week, people were excited to take it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBqtcI"&gt;In Connecticut, Hartford HealthCare let people decide which type of vaccine to sign up for, and the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPutterman/status/1367146604231294980"&gt;more popular&lt;/a&gt; than expected. People were also given the choice at a Miami vaccination site. One recipient &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/us/miami-vaccines-pfizer-johnson-and-johnson/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that she picked Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson because it’s one dose; she’s afraid of needles and only wanted to do it once. A Minnesota couple &lt;a href="https://kttc.com/2021/03/04/rochester-residents-begin-receiving-the-one-and-done-johnson-johnson-vaccine/"&gt;told KTTC-TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that they were eager to get a vaccine that was only one dose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37aI0V"&gt;That’s a big relief for experts who worried that the shot faced a communications problem. Even though the vaccine was just as good as the other two authorized vaccines at keeping people out of the hospital and alive, overall, its ability to prevent disease wasn’t quite as strong during the trials testing it. They thought there might be the (mostly unfounded) perception that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine wasn’t a good option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnwtrI"&gt;“We have a vaccine now that has good efficacy that everyone is going to compare to the existing vaccines, and say it doesn’t look quite as good,” said Eric Rubin, a professor of immunology, during a meeting of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee last week. Experts stressed that people should take whichever vaccine they’re offered first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N5mRqO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Re: J&amp;amp;J 72% vs Pfizer/Moderna 95% – it's sorta like comparing scores of golfers who teed off during a calm morning to those who teed off at 1pm when winds were howling. While it's hard to make precise adjustment, it's clear that equally good play will result in different scores.&lt;/p&gt;— Bob Wachter (@Bob_Wachter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1367828152936898561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O59pcU"&gt;But despite those early concerns, people around the country seem eager to line up for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. In addition to only requiring one dose — so people don’t have to take the time for two appointments — it can have &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/02/26/j-j-covid-vaccine-fda-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna/6806367002/"&gt;fewer side effects&lt;/a&gt; than the gene-based Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udPshg"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-021-00409-0%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dcommission_junction%26utm_campaign%3D3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100084481%26utm_content%3Ddeeplink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22315138%2Fcovid-vaccine-single-shot-johnson-distribution" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard to directly compare&lt;/a&gt; the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to the other vaccines. They were tested at different times and in different locations. The gene-based vaccines were tested before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; that could make vaccines less effective were widespread. But all three vaccines are similar in one important way: they’re overwhelmingly effective at keeping people from developing severe cases of COVID-19 and out of the hospital. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22307585/covid-19-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-efficacy"&gt;all more effective than the flu shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yotU9y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s looking like the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is very popular. Accounted for 984 doses, versus 1,166 for Pfizer. (FEMA had said they only had 500 J&amp;amp;J each day, but spox said had some leftover from Wed and got more)&lt;/p&gt;— Doug Hanks (@doug_hanks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doug_hanks/status/1367650936940822537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4861Us"&gt;The single-dose formulation is also more convenient. “It’s a hassle having to take time off work,” Salome Ruperty told &lt;a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/03/05/bronx-residents-line-up-to-be-the-first-to-receive-johnson---johnson-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Spectrum News NY1&lt;/a&gt; while lined up at a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine site in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2enu7Z"&gt;Some people may still turn down the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine and seek out either the Moderna or Pfizer / BioNTech shots. But the early reports make it seem less likely that the doses will go unused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bbcqo7"&gt;Just under &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/01/972538146/johnson-johnson-vaccine-rollout-begins-in-u-s-as-covid-19-cases-tick-up"&gt;4 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine were distributed to States this week. The company says it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of March and 100 million by June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy [Update: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6v1Hxy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 2021 1:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition models. If you are still looking for an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051814155050893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, it is still available on the retailer’s website. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYCYSU"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been out for over three months now. Since then, it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;one of the most difficult gadgets to purchase&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for another shot to get this console, Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; models up for purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9Vave"&gt;If you are looking for an Xbox Series X / S instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315452/xbox-series-x-s-restock-best-buy-price-pass-controller"&gt;Best Buy has also restocked Microsoft’s next-gen consoles today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you obtain your PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games or the PS5 version of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-PlayStation-5/dp/B08VJNMWR8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available on Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Uls0S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh2iyW"&gt;If you plan to play local co-op with family or friends, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; might also be a good item to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;One thing I also recommend buying is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners, that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that were released originally on PS4, including &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted IV: A Thief’s End. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll53Kj"&gt;There’s no way to expand the SSD storage in your PS5 yet, but Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer. But, if you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VMTNDMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="SBR5ek"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony will reportedly enable PS5 SSD expansion this summer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"},{"title":"Best Buy has stock available for the Xbox Series X and S right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22303116/xbox-series-x-s-restock"},{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="P5Bi9M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
