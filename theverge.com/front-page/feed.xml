    <title>Facebook suppressed report that made it look bad</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V13Di4"&gt;On Wednesday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; about what content was most viewed by people in the US last quarter. It was the first time it had released such a report. But &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/facebook-popular-posts.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook was working on a similar report for the first quarter of 2021 that it opted not to share because it might have reflected poorly on the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYUyXH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which obtained a copy of the report, says that the most-viewed link in the first quarter had a headline that could promote COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330428/facebook-research-vaccine-hesitancy-doubt-coronavirus"&gt;been an issue on the social media platform&lt;/a&gt;. The headline read, “A ‘healthy’ doctor died two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why.” The article was published by &lt;em&gt;The South Florida Sun Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; and republished by &lt;em&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlnMWp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Executives feared it could be a public relations issue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdOyEp"&gt;Facebook was working on releasing this report, but executives, including Alex Schultz, Facebook’s CMO and VP of analytics, apparently “debated whether it would cause a public relations problem, according to the internal emails” and ultimately decided not to publish it, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mgn0u9"&gt;“We considered making the report public earlier but since we knew the attention it would garner, exactly as we saw this week, there were fixes to the system we wanted to make,” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement. Stone also clarified Schultz’s opinion on if Facebook should release the report, saying that Schultz “advocated for putting out the report.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEYVkp"&gt;It’s been a busy week for Facebook. In addition to publishing the report about the top-viewed posts, it has also had to contend with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22627032/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-complaint-monopoly-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company by the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qMqmE7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook releases a report on the most-viewed content in News Feed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"},{"title":"FTC says Facebook has been a monopoly ‘since at least 2011’ in amended antitrust complaint","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22627032/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-complaint-monopoly-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans shares its new policy banning sexually explicit content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4J_yBcxRxOru_E9pDP4eIT3iHBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755572/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEuVCT"&gt;On Thursday the video and image sharing site OnlyFans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;announced plans to ban “sexually-explicit content”&lt;/a&gt; starting October 1st. While we’re still not sure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633411/onlyfans-banned-explicit-porn-sex-content-after-bbc-investigation-leak"&gt;exactly why&lt;/a&gt; it’s changing so drastically, it just sent out an updated Terms of Service policy to the creators who’ve built the site detailing exactly what won’t be allowed going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olv5aF"&gt;Comparing &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/aup"&gt;the new OnlyFans Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms#acceptable-use-policy"&gt;the old one&lt;/a&gt; makes the additions clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldp61G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not upload, post, display, or publish Content on OnlyFans that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uQlMlr"&gt;Shows, promotes, advertises or refers to “sexually explicit conduct”, which means:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WdnGw0"&gt;actual or simulated sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, between persons of any sex;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vyQkWo"&gt;actual or simulated masturbation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5JghHn"&gt;any exhibition of the anus or genitals of any person which is extreme or offensive;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qVoqtP"&gt;actual or simulated material depicting bodily fluids commonly secreted during sexual conduct;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RvKYs8"&gt;All existing Content that shows, promotes, advertises or refers to “sexually explicit conduct” (which has the meaning given to it in section 5(b) of this Policy) must be removed before December 1, 2021, or by any other date which we communicate to Users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="R2BTyO"&gt;Other sections of the policy that ban deepfakes, drugs, or violence, remain unchanged. In an email to OnlyFans creators, the site specified that “Content containing nudity will continue to be allowed as long as it is consistent with the policy.” Posts can show off body parts, but doing anything explicit (or zooming in too close) means they will be in violation. Any breach “may lead to your account being suspended or terminated, and access to your earnings being revoked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2vQWc"&gt;OnlyFans has largely built its billion-dollar business and brand on sex workers providing exactly the kind of content that’s being banned. Now those content creators have until December 1st to wipe any traces of the suddenly unacceptable content from their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance to attempt second Mars soil scoop, hoping rocks don’t ‘crumble’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcLnp0uMv2ii2W91r3ydGMKA1AE=/0x29:1280x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755428/26115_NavCam_Left_LF_0164_0681506334_116CWS_N0060000NCAM00315_0A00LLJ01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo showing the hole drilled during Perseverance’s first sample collection attempt, that left the rover’s sample tube empty. | NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dpGLWZ"&gt;NASA’s Mars rover, Perseverance, is getting ready for another attempt, in the coming weeks, to scoop up Martian rocks after its first attempt earlier this month didn’t play out as engineers expected. The rover’s sample-caching arm worked, engineers say, but the sampling tube turned up empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdRc2b"&gt;Now the rover, a science lab on wheels that landed on Mars in February, will drive to a new location called Citadelle for a second shot at picking up its first rock sample. This time, to make sure a sample is actually collected, engineers will wait for images of the sample tube to come back before it gets processed and stowed inside the rover’s belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzpnPc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘No sample? What do you mean no sample?’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DeFyBB"&gt;“We were just super excited that the hardware worked from beginning to end without any faults. And then there was that surprise — ‘No sample? What do you mean no sample?’,” Louise Jandura, the Chief Engineer for Sampling &amp;amp; Caching on NASA’s Perseverance team, says of the first attempt on August 5th. “So quickly, after that sunk in, we started to do the investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr746o"&gt;The rock that Perseverance’s sampling drill bit dug into wasn’t as sturdy as scientists thought it’d be. What was supposed to be a fairly solid rock core turned out to be a crumbly powder that slipped out of the rover’s sampling tube. After finding the sample tube was empty, mission staff used the rover’s cameras to analyze remnants of the hole that Perseverance drilled. They figured the mound of dust around the hole and some material at the bottom of the hole were what slipped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VpGUBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10711752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fsFhuu"&gt;“The rock simply wasn’t our kind of rock,” Jennifer Trosper, Project Manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Although we had successfully acquired over 100 cores in a range of different test rocks on Earth, we had not encountered a rock in our test suite that behaved in quite this manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qOvkK"&gt;Perseverance’s seven-foot, five-jointed sampling arm reaches out from the front of the rover toward a rock of interest with a large shoe box-sized head, or turret, on the end that weighs 100 pounds. That head packs a hollow drill bit, formally called a &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25565/rotary-percussive-corer-drill/"&gt;Rotary Percussive Corer Drill&lt;/a&gt;, that drills into the rock and traps material inside a tube, which gets stowed back into the rover and processed inside another tube until it’s ready to get left somewhere on the Martian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRhAY0"&gt;The drill bit used for Perseverance’s first sampling attempt is for collecting rock cores. Some of the rover’s 9 drill bits are better suited for collecting regolith — the more crumbly, dirt-like material that engineers accidentally encountered during the first sampling attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4cdQmktesLoKSKzW6ls5W0T3_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22796020/Aug_20_2021_17_07_53.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RvHkpa"&gt;Perseverance’s mission to collect up to 35 samples of Martian rocks is the first leg of a three-pronged endeavor to return those samples back to Earth sometime in the 2030s. The rocks, stowed inside tiny chalk-sized sample tubes, would represent the first pristine Mars samplings ever captured and returned to Earth by humans. Perseverance will leave the tubes somewhere on the Martian surface for a future NASA robot to collect and launch into Mars’ orbit, where another spacecraft built by the European Space Agency will catch and carry it the rest of the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPDtSL"&gt;NASA engineers spent nearly a decade designing and building the rover’s sampling system, which Perseverance’s chief engineer Adam Steltzner has described as “the most complicated, most sophisticated thing that we know how to build.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdeYj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story on the tiny details that make game development so hard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_81k_pKy_JQd7_NZqRx3mPS-Wh8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755412/vpavic_180607_2652_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRHSzi"&gt;While many video games might feel nearly effortless to play, letting you make impossible jumps, drive cars at breakneck speeds, cast magic out of thin air, and so much more, actually &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; those games is a superhuman feat of its own. Just one game often requires the efforts of a huge team laboriously crafting every minute detail, and very little of it that comes easy, as detailed by numerous developers who spoke to &lt;em&gt;IGN’s&lt;/em&gt; Rebekah Valentine in &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-hardest-part-making-game-everything"&gt;this article that you should read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AqQzN"&gt;Valentine’s article has a lot of fascinating stories from developers answering this question: “What is a thing in video games that seems simple but is actually extremely hard for game developers to make?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ws3n1j"&gt;Take elevators, for example, which, in a video game, aren’t just a moving platform behind doors. &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; lead level designer Bill Gardner described the potential problems of just trying to get inside one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1YlbrY"&gt;First off, you have to summon [an elevator] via a button or whatever. By calling the elevator, you open the opportunity for the player, objects, or AI to wander underneath it and get squished or trapped. So suddenly you have to deal with that. It’s an invitation to make your enemies or companions look dumb, for physics objects to go flying, or for quest items to get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o1nKCT"&gt;Or how about the act of responding to any player input? Here’s how Johnnemann Nordhagen, a developer at Dim Bulb Games, discusses it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="USqAwU"&gt;Something I’ve spent many hours on is player input. It seems simple — you press spacebar; you jump. But then you start to fall into all the special cases. What if the player is crouching? What if you want the spacebar to also activate items that the player is standing near? What about players using controllers instead of a keyboard? What about letting players remap their control scheme? What happens when the game is paused, or in a menu? What if, God help you, this is a networked game and you need to send that to a server? It turns into a system that requires multiple layers of abstraction to be able to handle all the possible things that might happen in a game when a player wants to jump, or presses the spacebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CdP82n"&gt;And developers in the article don’t just discuss the challenges of game mechanics; they also describe difficult aspects of things like storytelling and localization. Here’s just one really good anecdote, from JC Lau, a producer at Harebrained Schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GqABYb"&gt;When I worked at Xbox in localization, it was when the console rolled out its friends list feature and there was a little popup that said, ‘Socialize with your friends’ directing people to use the friends list. In Polish, that got translated to ‘Support socialism with your friends,’ which was thankfully caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pVyfFR"&gt;The whole article is packed with other interesting details and stories. Great games are easy to take for granted while playing them, but these developers’ tales are a good reminder that game development can be very hard. I highly recommend taking a few minutes out of your day to &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-hardest-part-making-game-everything"&gt;go read Valentine’s story on &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7DsOaP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why game developers can’t get a handle on doors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22328169/game-development-doors-design-difficult"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>GM recalls all Chevy Bolts for fire risk </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0LUgRKwKZ0R2xp_Ta2_R1XRQFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755322/akrales_170313_1481_A_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZY2mfP"&gt;General Motors is &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/aug/0820-bolt.html"&gt;expanding its recall&lt;/a&gt; of the Chevy Bolt to include all models — including the two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs"&gt;new versions&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year — after multiple fires in the electric vehicle’s battery packs caused by defects in the LG Chem cells found inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKfAVd"&gt;GM is warning owners not to charge their Bolts in or near their homes overnight, and to park the vehicles outside when not being charged. It’s also asking owners not to charge their Bolts above 90 percent, or to deplete the battery to below 70 miles of remaining range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79Mv2L"&gt;Owners should follow these guidelines until replacement modules — the groups of batteries that make up the pack — are ready. It’s not clear when that will be, though. GM says it will “only begin replacing battery modules in customer vehicles when GM and LG are confident in the safety of LG’s product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ncAfjV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Replacement batteries will only be available when “GM and LG are confident in the safety of LG’s product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WrGDf3"&gt;“We are working aggressively with LG to adjust production to have replacement modules available as soon as possible,” Daniel Flores, a spokesperson for GM, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs8yDc"&gt;GM had already recalled the 2017-2019 model year Bolts twice after the initial fix — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;in which new software was supposed to help stop any fires from happening&lt;/a&gt; — appeared not to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPALkR"&gt;The expansion of the recall comes after a 2020 model year Bolt caught fire this week in the United States. A video of the fire had been posted to YouTube but was removed a few hours later, and users on Reddit had noticed that it was a newer Bolt that wasn’t subject to the original recalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evc6Zg"&gt;GM confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the vehicle was in fact a 2020 Bolt, but said it has not had a chance to inspect the remains of the electric car. “That vehicle is certainly troubling but we base recall decisions on data,” Flores said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr0K7f"&gt;In July, GM confirmed that the fires happen when there are two defects present in the LG Chem batteries that power the Bolt. On Friday, the company specified that the defects are a torn anode tab and a folded separator in the cell. It also shared that the defects are in cells made at multiple plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UQtvy3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The recall has cost GM nearly $2 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9QwCn"&gt;“After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at LG and disassembling battery packs, GM discovered manufacturing defects in certain battery cells produced at LG manufacturing facilities beyond the Ochang, Korea, plant,” GM wrote in a statement. “GM and LG are working to rectify the cause of these defects. In the meantime, GM is pursuing commitments from LG for reimbursement of this field action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEMln9"&gt;The recall has cost GM some $800 million to date, but the company said Friday that the expanded recall will cost an additional $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkELeb"&gt;GM is not alone in having trouble with LG’s batteries. Hyundai had to recall the Kona EV earlier this year after a handful of vehicles caught fire. The company even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396480/hyundai-discontinue-kona-ev-korea-battery-fire-recall"&gt;discontinued the electric SUV in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, as sales cratered following the fires and the recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Th6wda"&gt;But GM’s partnership with LG runs deep. GM and LG are spending billions of dollars building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387129/gm-lg-tennessee-ultium-battery-factory-spring-hill"&gt;battery factories in the US&lt;/a&gt; to supply cells for the automaker’s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, including the Hummer EV. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SiQBww"&gt;We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264856/jeff-bezos-worth-amazon-founder-ceo-193-billion-dollars"&gt;made suggestions to Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; about what he could do with his hundreds of billions of dollars before, and we’re certainly &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JC083abgY1w?t=36"&gt;not the only ones to do so&lt;/a&gt; — but it seems like we’ve all been thinking small. While the public has been calling on Bezos to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HasBezosDecided"&gt;end world hunger&lt;/a&gt; or buy vaccines for almost two-thirds of the planet’s population, Bezos has been able to live out every child’s wildest dream by putting a soft-serve ice cream tap in his house, according to ice cream machine maker CVT Soft Serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSpMUwXpH6c/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"&gt;A post shared by CVT Soft Serve (@cvtsoftserve)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cM37kX"&gt;The “What The Actual. Fuck? !?” part of CVT’s caption seems to express surprise that the billionaire would do this, but I’m honestly unsure why. Who wouldn’t want their own ice cream machine if they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246203/data-visualization-billionaires-wealth-inequality-jeff-bezos-net-worth"&gt;all the money&lt;/a&gt;? If I were as rich as Bezos, I’d have an entire Golden Corral (which, from what I remember, has soft serve machines along with those garbage, delicious &lt;a href="https://www.georgehowe.com/jelly-beans/"&gt;big jelly beans&lt;/a&gt;) built next to my house. I might even be generous enough to let the general public eat there for free — ice cream is best when shared with others, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQWBua"&gt;Of course, the reaction online to Bezos’ ice cream has been hilarious. The &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/08/20/finally-we-have-learned-what-amazons-hq2-is-supposed-to-resemble/"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon’s HQ2 design looks suspiciously like a cone of soft-serve (which is a much nicer mental picture than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus"&gt;imagining it as a poop emoji&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported the story with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VICE/status/1428061712247410702"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying that “Big boy Jeff no longer has to leave his house for ice cream.” And, of course, there have been untold numbers of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_EeCkHs-e0"&gt;Bo Burnham&lt;/a&gt; references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaS4Cn"&gt;All of this raises one serious question — what’s Jeff Bezos’s diet like? There are &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-elon-musk-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-diets-2019-3"&gt;other billionaires who have famously bizarre diets&lt;/a&gt;, like Warren Buffet, who &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-diet-2017-10#of-course-buffett-eats-ice-cream-for-breakfast-of-course-i-was-the-idiot-who-saved-it-for-the-last-day-17"&gt;eats ice cream for breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, tons of McDonald's, and drinks Coke almost constantly. Will Bezos be joining him on the ice cream for breakfast train, or saving it as a special treat? These are the questions the world needs answers to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzNLcB"&gt;Oh, and we did ask CVT Soft Serve if we could interview the person who delivered the ice cream to Bezos. Unfortunately, the company told us that it couldn’t share any details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is using a custom logging device to track the trucks moving its freight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ZzGjwwumMl0EIxmLA3WJ_9adJM=/150x0:4050x2600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755052/1155745555.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FjSI4T"&gt;Amazon has developed electronic tracking technology for the trucks used by its partners to monitor their movement and hopefully improve driver safety, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-amazon-tracking-device-to-monitor-trucker-safety-collect-data"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Electronic logging devices (ELDs) are federally required to prevent fatigue-related accidents on trucks, but now it seems Amazon will offer its partners a custom ELD offering, possibly giving Amazon direct access to a lot more data from a tool it maintains itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlYtjo"&gt;Amazon’s Relay ELD — named after the company’s &lt;a href="https://relay.amazon.com/"&gt;Relay platform&lt;/a&gt; for booking delivery jobs — works by plugging hardware into the diagnostics port of trucks to directly digest information from the engine, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;writes. It then communicates that data over Bluetooth to be logged in an accompanying app. ELDs typically track location, movement, and when a truck turns on or off, to monitor drivers' hours. When asked, Amazon didn’t explicitly confirm that it had created its own ELD hardware. “As with many solutions, we use a third party for hardware manufacturing,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K4xQrL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ELDs are required, whether they’re made by Amazon or not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="StUgu4"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon’s ELD product is being offered to members of the Amazon Freight Partners Program (who often also lease trucks from the company) with the plan to have them installed in hundreds of tractor trucks by the end of the year. Amazon was able to confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it had begun piloting new ELDs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LS7AZB"&gt;“We are actively investing in safety mechanisms across our operations and recently started piloting new electronic logging devices, which are required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, with a select number of carriers to capture driver compliance with Hours of Service regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gb9fkp"&gt;Amazon says that currently the new ELDs are being piloted on six tractor trucks, to monitor &lt;a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service"&gt;hours of service (HOS)&lt;/a&gt; compliance — basically the maximum amount of time a driver is on duty, including breaks. The company didn’t share if the data is used for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjZJ9Z"&gt;The location and movement data Amazon sees could help make sure drivers are taking rest breaks on long-distance trips, or potentially help the company make other logistics-related decisions. Previous plans that put cameras in the cabs of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-amazons-trucking-ambitions"&gt;semi-trucks&lt;/a&gt; have also raised questions about what kinds of Amazon monitoring go too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fPq72"&gt;Still, an ELD seems far less invasive than a camera — and again, the ELDs would be there anyway — but it’s still a valuable piece of a larger information puzzle, for keeping drivers safe, and Amazon packages on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ed4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="HfA92K"&gt;Android 12’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22206092"&gt;public beta is now available&lt;/a&gt;, following Google’s deep dive into the new software at Google I/O 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;My colleague Dieter Bohn got an exclusive in-depth look&lt;/a&gt; at the new Material You design language, as well as everything else that’s new. And good news: if you’ve got an eligible device, you can try it out right now, and that’s what I’m going to walk you through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt42YD"&gt;What’s great is that you don’t have to go through the tricky, fail-prone task of flashing your phone. Instead, you can easily enroll it to receive the update with a few clicks from your desktop or mobile browser, and in just a few minutes, you’ll be ready to install it on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcSZRh"&gt;When you set up the Android 12 beta on your device, you’ll be set to receive all future beta updates to the OS (including the final release) over the air, which is convenient. As always, keep in mind that this beta is unfinished software, so you could encounter bugs ranging in severity. At the very least, make sure that your device data is backed up on the cloud, and maybe think twice about loading the beta onto your daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2tPxD"&gt;First, let’s see if you have an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PSE32G"&gt;Which phones currently work with Android 12 beta?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="shYkqe"&gt;Pixel 3, 3 XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0y9mMh"&gt;Pixel 3A, 3A XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCnwI5"&gt;Pixel 4, 4 XL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uz1NKb"&gt;Pixel 4A, 4A 5G&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f7OJNO"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="60pdaS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FContent%2FAndroid-12-Beta%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22442576%2Fandroid-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z5CUDP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fcn%2Fos%2Fdeveloper-preview%2Fandroid12&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22442576%2Fandroid-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 9, 9 Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wofbdn"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://developers.oppomobile.com/wiki/doc/index#id=91"&gt;Oppo Find X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; (model CPH2173)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4WKaBi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/global/en/android-12-beta.html"&gt;TCL 20 Pro 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="m4HRC0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/en-gl/developer/android-12/"&gt;ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8q22Yu"&gt;as well as models from &lt;a href="https://k-tai.sharp.co.jp/support/developers/android12_betaprogram/"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://spot.tecno.com/global/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;amp;tid=98054&amp;amp;id=98054"&gt;Tecno&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realmebbs.com/post-details/1393156430865309696"&gt;Realme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pqo2S3"&gt;How to install the Android 12 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DcweJw"&gt;How you get this software on your phone ranges from requiring just a few clicks to something more involved. For this beta download, it’s considerably easier to get the Android 12 beta on one of the supported Google Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nukaT"&gt;For a Pixel, begin by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta"&gt;visiting the Android 12 beta site to enroll your phone in the beta&lt;/a&gt;. You should be able to find your phone listed when you click “view your eligible devices”. You might be nudged via notification on your phone that the software is ready to install. If you want to check manually, open the settings menu on your phone, then head to System &amp;gt; System Update. Tap “Check for update” to see if you can download the new software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5turHD"&gt;If nothing happens right away, your only option is to keep waiting. In the past, I’ve gotten the beta update on my phone within minutes of enrolling, though sometimes it takes hours. Google says it may take over 24 hours for the software to be ready to install on your phone, so hang tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feWDkB"&gt;As for supported phones from other brands like OnePlus, Realme, Sharp, and others, follow the instructions on each page, as the process for installation seems to differ depending on the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Nvidia controlling Arm could create real problems,’ UK regulator concludes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0V-y4GgPsoBKmJh90KrCo2uQTyM=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754619/NVIDIA_Endeavor_building_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="390JrG"&gt;Remember when Nvidia’s CEO warned yesterday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632017/nvidia-acquisition-arm-timeframe-18-months-schedule-regulatory-scrutiny"&gt;buying Arm might take “longer than initially thought&lt;/a&gt;,” but that it was no big deal and “not one particular delay”? It sure &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like a big deal as of today: on Friday, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended a Phase 2 investigation, because it’s worried that Nvidia would be incentivized to stifle innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwUmEZ"&gt;“We’re concerned that NVIDIA controlling Arm could create real problems for NVIDIA’s rivals by limiting their access to key technologies, and ultimately stifling innovation across a number of important and growing markets. This could end up with consumers missing out on new products, or prices going up,” writes CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-finds-competition-concerns-with-nvidia-s-purchase-of-arm"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rml1FK"&gt;While the CMA’s full report isn’t available yet, it does offer &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/summary-of-the-cmas-report-to-the-secretary-of-state-for-digital-culture-media-sport-on-the-anticipated-acquisition-by-nvidia-corporation-of-arm/nvidia-arm-summary-of-the-cmas-report-to-the-secretary-of-state-for-digital-culture-media-sport-on-the-anticipated-acquisition-by-nvidia-corpo#public-interest"&gt;an executive summary&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of the reasons for concern: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ryycJy"&gt;1.7 The CMA found significant competition concerns as a result of the effect of such foreclosure in the supply of CPUs, interconnect products, GPUs, and SoCs across several global markets, spanning the datacentre, internet-of-things, automotive and gaming console applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y94K7T"&gt;1.8. The CMA found that the foreclosure strategies identified would reinforce each other and would, individually and cumulatively, lead to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition (&lt;strong&gt;SLC&lt;/strong&gt;), and consequently to a stifling of innovation, and more expensive or lower quality products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="U6DtbV"&gt;“The CMA believes that the Merger may create incentives to change Arm’s business model to favour NVIDIA,” one passage reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKKrDN"&gt;While the CMA notes that Nvidia offered to “ensure an open licensing regime, based on equal access and interoperability,” the regulator suggested that it doesn’t believe that would be enough. Even if Nvidia agreed to sell off some of Arm’s intellectual property, that wouldn’t be enough without a deeper investigation, the CMA says, given how complex the licensing arrangements can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KXwEit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;National security was also a potential concern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBeTpG"&gt;The British government announced in April that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;also worried about national security implications&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the CMA to investigate those as well, but the executive summary doesn’t offer any conclusions there. If there had been any, they might have pushed the CMA to move to a phase two investigation — but it sounds like that’s what’s happening regardless. The investigation now gets referred back to the UK’s Secretary of State to decide “whether the merger should be referred for an in-depth Phase 2 investigation on both competition and national security grounds, or if it should be passed back to the CMA to investigate on competition grounds only.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rBnhz"&gt;As my colleague James Vincent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632017/nvidia-acquisition-arm-timeframe-18-months-schedule-regulatory-scrutiny"&gt;wrote yesterday,&lt;/a&gt; the UK isn’t the only regulator interested in this deal, and Nvidia currently has until 2022 to clear the purchase with those regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZJ1q9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONyrRs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to take advantage of Android 12’s new privacy options  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bi2nWiys1f38Ptr8LN5ZzUQ_N30=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69754580/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eoCcjO"&gt;Privacy is probably one of the biggest buzzwords in tech these days, and even the data-loving Google is getting in on the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZo9mH"&gt;The Android 12 update boasts a handful of privacy-related additions you’d be wise to explore. (The software is currently at the tail end of its beta phase and expected to launch any week now.) Some of them are under the hood and automatic — such as the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22436367/google-io-android-private-computer-core-machine-learning-data-privacy"&gt;Private Compute Core&lt;/a&gt; that’ll allow certain types of sensitive computing to happen in an isolated environment, entirely on your device. But others are more on the surface. And that means it’s up to you to take advantage of them — or at least understand what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1WUkx"&gt;Here are the three most significant privacy-related additions in Android 12 and what you need to know in order to take advantage of them. (Note that for now, Android 12 is only available on Pixel phones; once it is available on other devices, directions may vary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mPCfiA"&gt;Privacy Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Gk2htd"&gt;First and foremost in the Android 12 privacy lineup is Google’s shiny new Privacy Dashboard. It’s essentially a streamlined command center that lets you see how different apps are accessing data on your device so you can clamp down on that access as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3PPkP"&gt;In Google’s version of Android, you can get to the Privacy Dashboard in three easy steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bKuCAA"&gt;Open up your system settings (by swiping down twice from the top of the screen and tapping the gear-shaped icon on the panel that appears).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VEvrUI"&gt;Scroll down and tap the Privacy section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qcO2iF"&gt;Tap the “Privacy Dashboard” entry at the top of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Privacy Dashboard in Android 12. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7a0xXt-xmDfDEqvzhDayI8UKpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795021/android_12_privacy_dashboard.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Privacy Dashboard in Android 12. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A timeline of data access is never more than a tap away. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zU31T4ntdzXxohO_UcQwXaSA4I8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795023/android_12_privacy_dashboard_list.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A timeline of data access is never more than a tap away. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBwdG6"&gt;From the Privacy Dashboard, you can drill down into any specific type of feature (such as “Location” or “Camera”) and you’ll get a timeline that tells you exactly which apps have been accessing that feature when. (If you’re looking for a feature other than location, camera, or microphone, you may need to tap on “See other permissions” at the bottom of the screen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqyR4O"&gt;After that, if anything seems amiss to you, all it takes is one more tap to get into any app’s permission list and pull back on what it’s able to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gBsXBW"&gt;Sensor access indicators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ck7ZMV"&gt;Next on the Android 12 privacy list is a feature you’ll occasionally see on your screen but whose message might not always be obvious. Whenever an app is accessing your phone’s camera or microphone — even if only in the background — Android 12 will place an indicator in the upper-right corner of your screen to alert you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rk98r3"&gt;When the indicator first appears, it shows an icon that corresponds with the exact manner of access. But that icon remains visible only for a second or so, after which point the indicator changes to a tiny green dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p809BU"&gt;So how can you know what’s being accessed and which app is responsible? The secret is in the swipe down: Anytime you see a green dot in the corner of your screen, swipe down once from the top of the display. The dot will expand back to that full icon, and you can then tap it to see exactly what’s involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12’s access indicators start out as icons, but then change to tiny green dots." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DtKvRdBgQimBBKq4pM-uLcMi1Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795138/android_12_access_indicator.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12’s access indicators start out as icons, but then change to tiny green dots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A swipe and a tap will reveal any current and recent past sensor access." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlDGNVhME3OdnW3nEHIgl7M_ENg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795463/android_12_access_indicator_details_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A swipe and a tap will reveal any current and recent past sensor access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2bZLdw"&gt;Tapping on any app’s name in that pop-up will take you directly to that app’s permission page, where you can reassess what types of access it does and does not allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bKYzoY"&gt;Fast-toggle sensor switches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oeBXvp"&gt;Last but not least is a new series of toggles that let you turn your phone’s camera, microphone, or GPS sensor completely off with a single fast tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkUsP7"&gt;The toggles live within Android’s Quick Settings panel, and they might be hidden by default. To uncover them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZigVyP"&gt;Swipe down twice from the top of your phone’s screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DkNKlg"&gt;Tap the pencil-shaped icon in the lower-left corner of the Quick Settings panel. If you’re using a phone other than a Pixel, you might have to tap a three-line menu icon and then look for an “Edit” command there instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CDnMMN"&gt;Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the list and look for the tiles labeled “Camera access,” “Mic access,” and “Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NzCsIf"&gt;One by one, press and hold each tile for a second, then slide your finger up to move it into the active area of your Quick Settings panel. The higher up you go, the higher it’ll appear in the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new camera, microphone, and location access toggles can easily be moved..." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WgJykj6-jNa80pXo956nz9pnuog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795464/android_12_sensor_toggles.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new camera, microphone, and location access toggles can easily be moved...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...into the active and visible area of the Android Quick Settings panel." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ece5XVNTl9bZCWf0c0cbPfMSmEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22795465/android_12_sensor_toggles_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...into the active and visible area of the Android Quick Settings panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7zaxo"&gt;Once you’ve got all three in place, just tap the arrow in the upper-left corner of the screen. The fast-toggle switches will now be present and accessible in your regular Quick Settings area. And all it’ll take is a swift swipe down and a tap on the right tile to disable any associated sensor at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnxCat"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7vcqm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
