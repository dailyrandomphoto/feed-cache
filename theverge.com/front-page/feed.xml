    <title>Predictably, T-Mobile’s merger promises weren’t enough to make a carrier out of Dish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c7Sxbus-lHW2cjZyGTaBgjHD3FA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615817/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sprint acquisition deal included too few requirements and put too much trust in a big corporation to do the right thing. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w4r1In"&gt;When T-Mobile acquired Sprint in April of 2020, it brought our major wireless carrier choices from four down to three. Recognizing that this would indeed be a bad thing for US wireless customers (aka all of us), T-Mobile agreed to a set of conditions with the FCC’s blessing that would theoretically position Dish Network to fill the Sprint-shaped hole in our wireless landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZdDcv"&gt;In other words, one wireless competitor was allowed to reduce competition only if it agreed to help set up another competitor in its place. Sounds a little suspect, right? Surely a deal like that would include a lot of conditions, requirements, and oversight to make sure it would actually work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq1jlv"&gt;But looking back, these were the major requirements imposed on T-Mobile to prop up Dish as a competitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CfeG9G"&gt;Sell Sprint’s prepaid business, including Boost Mobile, to Dish within 120 days after the close of the merger, and maintain Boost’s competitiveness before the divestiture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rw0lgm"&gt;Provide Dish’s wireless customers with access to the T-Mobile network for at least six years through a wholesale MVNO agreement while Dish builds its own network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jgbqcS"&gt;Provide transition services for up to three years afterward to ensure Boost customers are transferred smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kB3OaQ"&gt;Not do anything anticompetitive toward Boost, like throttling or limiting access to new network technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TLnpY1"&gt;Sell Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum to Dish three years after the closing of the merger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z7SbSn"&gt;Give Dish the option to acquire old Sprint cell sites and retail stores that T-Mobile opts to  decommission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NM9THA"&gt;Provide Dish with reasonable advance notice of network transition plans that could affect Boost customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="eTekCm"&gt;What’s missing there is any definition of success. The burden for the success of the plan lay on Dish’s shoulders, not T-Mobile’s, with Dish being the one legally required to cover 70 percent of the US population with 5G by 2023 (or now &lt;a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20200914/5g/dish-officially-gets-more-time-to-build-out-its-licenses-and-only-5g-will-do"&gt;possibly 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxOBcZ"&gt;Here we are roughly a year later and so far, T-Mobile appears to have technically done everything it said it would do for Dish by now. But is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? It sure doesn’t seem so. The fact that Dish has now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;fled into the arms of AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; shows how insufficient T-Mobile’s support has been: instead of relying on the partner mandated by the $26 billion mega merger, Dish now has to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;spend $5 billion on a competitor&lt;/a&gt; to get where it wants to go. While not the final proof, it’s the latest reminder that the deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"&gt;was built on a shaky premise to start with&lt;/a&gt;, and regulators largely took it on faith &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;that big corporations would keep their promises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LmnTgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is the scheme to prop up our fourth wireless carrier working? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0G42tr"&gt;From the beginning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908539/t-mobile-sprint-merger-dish-network-failure-stopped-antitrust-experts-doj"&gt;critics of the merger deal&lt;/a&gt; suggested that it depended too much on T-Mobile and Dish doing the right thing, and was so vague that it left the door open for funny business that could seriously hamper the effort to prop up Dish. The new T-Mobile wasted little time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429587/t-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic"&gt;breaking its promise of being “jobs-positive from day one”&lt;/a&gt; and it didn’t take long after the Boost sale for it to mess with Dish, too. In October of 2020, T-Mobile told Dish it would be shutting down Sprint’s old CDMA network — which many of Dish’s Boost customers rely on — on January 1st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4heND"&gt;T-Mobile says it went above and beyond its obligations set out in the merger deal, and that may be technically true: regulators only required six months’ notice, and the company gave 14. T-Mobile’s filings with the FCC related to the merger don’t state exactly when it anticipated shutting down the CDMA network, just that it wouldn’t do so before January 1st, 2021. But T-Mobile also publicly promised it would “&lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/t-mobile-sprint-merger-doj-clearance"&gt;ensure continued and seamless operation of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; […] following transition to Dish’s ownership,” and yet its CDMA shutdown is on an even more aggressive timeline than rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2PuKA3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is bullshit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOqW8Y"&gt;Getting the word out to customers that they’ll need to buy a new device and acquiring enough phones for them takes time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T started notifying its customers&lt;/a&gt; of its February 2022 3G shutdown in July of last year, and as Dish has pointed out repeatedly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358628/verizon-3g-cdma-shutdown-date-2022"&gt;Verizon has delayed closing down its CDMA network&lt;/a&gt; by several years to give itself enough time to migrate customers still using 3G phones. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;a recent letter to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, Dish also pointed to other statements T-Mobile made that led it to believe that it would have a three-year period to migrate customers off the old network. T-Mobile’s response to the partner it was supposed to prop up? It more or less says that &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10411042233063/Letter%20to%20Acting%20Chairwoman%20Rosenworcel%20-%20Final.pdf"&gt;Dish wasn’t paying close enough attention&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwvJGB"&gt;Giving Dish a bit more than a year’s notice of a major service upheaval for many of its new customers is, to use the technical term, bullshit. (We’re not even counting the global health crisis and the chip shortage which might have made this task harder.) And while T-Mobile may be right when it claims to have played by the rules, it certainly qualifies as funny business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdYdnn"&gt;Clearly, the deal didn’t require enough from T-Mobile, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;relied too heavily on then-CEO John Legere and Dish’s Charlie Ergen seeming like pretty cool guys&lt;/a&gt; to the judge, Victor Marrero. Putting the onus on Dish to pay up if it missed its 2025 deadline predictably did nothing to encourage T-Mobile to play nice and help Dish along. Unless Dish can pull off something incredible, it looks like we’ll be living without that fourth major wireless carrier for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG adds mic and speakers to its air-purifying mask, launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vimawNRvwZUeCHZVenzzDiRjQf0=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615788/LG_PuriCare_Wearable_03.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG claims the battery-powered, air-filtering mask is comfortable to wear for up to eight hours at a time.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9xdDyv"&gt;LG has announced an updated version of its high-tech, air-purifying face mask, the terribly-named &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/07/for-top-athletes-breathing-clean-pure-air-while-training-is-now-a-reality"&gt;LG PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier&lt;/a&gt;. The company hasn’t announced pricing or widespread availability, but says the PuriCare will launch in Thailand next month “with other markets to follow once approved by local regulators.” Between the ongoing pandemic and widespread air pollution, there’s reason to think there’ll be demand for products like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBZaqP"&gt;LG first announced the mask &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403762/lg-puricare-wearable-air-purifier-mask-coronavirus-filter"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, which uses replaceable air filters and built-in fans to filter the air. LG says the new version has a smaller and lighter motor, as well as built-in microphones and speakers that amplify the wearer’s voice. (Video of the original mask shows that it &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NrokwBp1PZg?t=55"&gt;muffled speech&lt;/a&gt; quite effectively.) The latter technology, which LG is calling VoiceON, “automatically recognizes when users are talking and amplifies their voice through the built-in speaker.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYf31C"&gt;LG is not the first company to put this sort of voice-amplification tech in a face mask, with Razer’s Project Hazel mask (which is supposedly arriving in limited quantities later this year) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22524990/razer-hazel-mask-first-launch-early-fourth-quarter-2021-drops"&gt;offering a similar set-up&lt;/a&gt;. Razer’s mask also has LED lighting, so take that, LG.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hmbsYd2CtGHlOarXxNCbndOd32o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22732645/LG_PuriCare_Wearable_05.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OWMkEk"&gt;The new LG PuriCare mask weighs 94 grams, has a built in 1,000mAh battery, and recharges in two hours via USB. LG claims it’s comfortable enough to wear for up to eight hours at a time, but in my experience no mask is truly comfortable after a few hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrAH1f"&gt;Notably, LG is not claiming the mask will protect against the novel coronavirus in any way, though it did hint that this was the case when it first announced the product. It’s true that some air purifying filters &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/can-hepa-air-purifiers-capture-coronavirus/"&gt;do catch particles&lt;/a&gt; the size of the virus that causes COVID-19, but without scientific studies on this particular product or more details about the sort of filters it uses, we can’t and shouldn’t make any claims for its efficacy in this regard. A mask is certainly better than no mask, though, and the best mask is one you’ll happily wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xjZ3V"&gt;Anyway, welcome to 2021: we’re doing spec updates on face masks now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California sues Activision Blizzard over a culture of ‘constant sexual harassment’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ggjl4_jNx8qO55EwH81kNTqg-OQ=/8x0:1091x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69615648/TFEVVVUBSZIU1515612314418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nSokSS"&gt;California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) says that renowned game publishing studio Blizzard Entertainment, and its owner Activision Blizzard, have created a culture of “constant sexual harassment” and gender-based discrimination, in a new lawsuit filed Tuesday that claims top executives were aware and/or involved. And in the hours since the suit was revealed, numerous women have already stepped forward to corroborate the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i67Lzy"&gt;The details are so disturbing that we’re going to start with a &lt;strong&gt;trigger warning&lt;/strong&gt; right now. The idea that male employees held “cube crawls” is one of the &lt;em&gt;tamer&lt;/em&gt; allegations in the lawsuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VX5f0G"&gt;Female employees almost universally confirmed that working for Defendants was akin to working in a frat house, which invariably involved male employees drinking and subjecting female employees to sexual harassment with no repercussion. “Cube crawls” in Defendants’ offices were common and male employees proudly came into work hungover. Similarly, male employees would play video games during work, engage in banter about their sexual encounters, talk openly about female bodies, and make numerous jokes about rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1dC9U"&gt;As a product of this “frat boy” culture, women were subjected to numerous sexual comments and advances, groping and unwanted physical touching, and other forms of harassment. A female employee noted that random male employees would approach her on Defendants’ work site and comment on her breasts. Female employees working for the World of Warcraft team noted that male employees and supervisors would hit on them, make derogatory comments about rape, and otherwise engage in demeaning behavior. This behavior was known to supervisors and indeed encouraged by them, including a male supervisor openly encouraging a male subordinate to “buy” a prostitute to cure his bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TIpn1s"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack is specifically named as being aware of and enabling this sort of behavior, and an unnamed former Blizzard CTO “was observed by employees groping inebriated female employees at company events.” &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft &lt;/em&gt;senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi is also specifically named:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ahnq1J"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting, his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees. Afrasiabi was so known to engage in harassment of females that his suite was nicknamed the “Crosby Suite” after alleged rapist Bill Crosby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rjRG97"&gt;We’re assuming the DFEH meant Bill Cosby, but it’s not clear. A few even uglier things are described in the full complaint below, like how one employee committed suicide after extreme forms of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7IIHD"&gt;All of the alleged sexual harassment is on top of allegations of discrimination, such as refusals to promote women — “the manager commented that they could not risk promoting her as she might get pregnant and like being a mom,” one allegation reads — as well as pay discrimination and outright retaliation. Employees were allegedly “discouraged from complaining as human resource personnel were known to be close to alleged harassers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ho2h8b"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21014562-blizzard-activision-lawsuit-ca-dfeh/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Blizzard-Activision-lawsuit-ca-dfeh (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKN93T"&gt;Here is the full statement Activision Blizzard provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and other publications, which calls the lawsuit “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tN7vUu"&gt;We value diversity and strive to foster a workplace that offers inclusivity for everyone. There is no place in our company or industry, or any industry, for sexual misconduct or harassment of any kind. We take every allegation seriously and investigate all claims. In cases related to misconduct, action was taken to address the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GASo0R"&gt;The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkFYdH"&gt;The picture the DFEH paints is not the Blizzard workplace of today. Over the past several years and continuing since the initial investigation started, we’ve made significant changes to address company culture and reflect more diversity within our leadership teams. We’ve amplified internal programs and channels for employees to report violations, including the “ASK List” with a confidential integrity hotline, and introduced an Employee Relations team dedicated to investigating employee concerns. We have strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and combined our Employee Networks at a global level, to provide additional support. Employees must also undergo regular anti-harassment training and have done so for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N22ITk"&gt;We put tremendous effort in creating fair and rewarding compensation packages and policies that reflect our culture and business, and we strive to pay all employees fairly for equal or substantially similar work. We take a variety of proactive steps to ensure that pay is driven by non-discriminatory factors. For example, we reward and compensate employees based on their performance, and we conduct extensive anti-discrimination trainings including for those who are part of the compensation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Dbwi"&gt;We are confident in our ability to demonstrate our practices as an equal opportunity employer that fosters a supportive, diverse, and inclusive workplace for our people, and we are committed to continuing this effort in the years to come. It is a shame that the DFEH did not want to engage with us on what they thought they were seeing in their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6eobm7"&gt;Since the lawsuit was revealed, at least five former Blizzard employees have come forward on social media to corroborate details like the “cube crawl,” or that they had to deal with sexual harassment, or that they saw it happen, or that they actually appeared anonymously in the suit. We’re not embedding or linking to their posts without permission, since we’re worried they might be targeted online, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFfGiP"&gt;The California DFEH was also involved with a major sexual harassment and discrimination suit against Riot Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20992317/riot-games-settlement-details-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;which initially landed at a settlement of just $10 million&lt;/a&gt; before the DFEH suggested it should be $400 million or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33di5k"&gt;Ubisoft was embroiled in a huge sexual harassment scandal last year, one whose roots &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;may go back a decade&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499334/ubisoft-employees-workplace-misconduct-ceo-yves-guillemot-response"&gt;an October survey revealed&lt;/a&gt; that a full quarter of all Ubisoft employees said they’d seen or experienced sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GnYnyY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 21st, 8:11PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: After we first published this story, Amazon provided the following statement confirming it is looking into two customer service reports related to 3090 failures due to &lt;/em&gt;New World&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1rfkOr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have two customer service reports on this that we are following up on, and some reports of high GPU usage from forums, which is consistent with a graphically rich game. We do provide user select-able settings to reduce graphics, which correspondingly reduces GPU load, if the player desires.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="et5cyL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original story is below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FpPszr"&gt;
&lt;p id="nH2qNe"&gt;The closed beta for Amazon Games’ new MMO &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; has been marred by reports that the game has bricked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/oobi56/did_the_new_world_beta_brick_your_gpu/"&gt;some players’ Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement shared Wednesday, Amazon says that it has seen “no indication of widespread issues with 3090s,” but will be releasing a patch anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDKR3x"&gt;Here’s Amazon’s full statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5pww2Z"&gt;Hundreds of thousands of people played in the New World Closed Beta yesterday, with millions of total hours played. We’ve received a few reports of players using high-performance graphics cards experiencing hardware failure when playing New World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h89fbB"&gt;New World makes standard DirectX calls as provided by the Windows API. We have seen no indication of widespread issues with 3090s, either in the beta or during our many months of alpha testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgHz8f"&gt;The New World Closed Beta is safe to play. In order to further reassure players, we will implement a patch today that caps frames per second on our menu screen. We’re grateful for the support New World is receiving from players around the world, and will keep listening to their feedback throughout Beta and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AILDrI"&gt;The language in Amazon’s statement doesn’t completely rule out that the game may be causing problems, though. In particular, the phrasing “no indication of &lt;em&gt;widespread&lt;/em&gt; issues” (emphasis ours) suggests there could be some issues, and since we don’t know how broadly or narrowly Amazon is defining “widespread,” we can’t be sure how many cards the company has determined may be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UByB4Q"&gt;Many of the bricked cards appear to be manufactured by EVGA, based on reports in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/oobi56/did_the_new_world_beta_brick_your_gpu/"&gt;a thread on the &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. And issues with EVGA cards may run earlier than the beta, as one player &lt;a href="https://forums.newworld.com/t/issues-with-evga-rtx-3090-ftw3-ultra/112757"&gt;on the &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; forums&lt;/a&gt; said they’ve had one EVGA card die on them during the game’s alpha and one die during this beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Lcw4S"&gt;EVGA didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment, but a company representative &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/amazons-new-world-bricking-rtx-3090-graphics-cards"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; that&lt;/a&gt; “at the moment we are dealing with specific problems, if it is a problem really confirmed we will inform and inform you in our &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30-Series-f113.aspx"&gt;EVGA forums&lt;/a&gt; on our website.” But if you’ve got a 3090 card of any kind, you might want to wait to play the game until Amazon’s patch is out just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SsE0w"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; closed beta runs through August 2nd. If you want to try it, you can pre-ordering the game to get an invite or sign up for an opportunity to get access via &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/tester-sign-up"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. The game is set to release on August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;following numerous delays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s dark new expansion has fuzzy cats to pet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nuqyRoTP8e8ovV9HY3BLKftMOk=/0x46:3083x2101/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614599/Screen_Shot_2021_07_21_at_4.06.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOTY.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sucker Punch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bHwrZv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; will let you pet even more animals than you could in the original version of the game, developer Sucker Punch revealed Wednesday. When &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; first launched, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1261029893271322629"&gt;you could only pet foxes&lt;/a&gt;, and a few months after release, Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1314317243107303424"&gt;added the ability to pet dogs&lt;/a&gt;, but in the new Iki Island expansion that’s part of &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, we now know that you’ll be able to pet cats, deer, and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEMeLT"&gt;All the animals look absolutely adorable and very deserving of pets. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1417899233932308484"&gt;Here’s one of the cats&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IJJmQn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Jin can find animal sanctuaries across Iki Island where he can play soothing melodies with his flute to tame various animals. Once they’ve been calmed, Jin can return to pet them as often as you’d like. Cats are just one example. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SZmnbi0yLK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SZmnbi0yLK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ghost of Tsushima   Director's Cut Out 8/20!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlnjVa"&gt;And here’s a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1417899698401124352"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1417900145346179073"&gt;monkey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3XBM5s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Monkeys also inhabit multiple sanctuaries, or can be found hanging around at some local hot springs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nwYAAwXmvJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nwYAAwXmvJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ghost of Tsushima   Director's Cut Out 8/20!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n3Dg5I"&gt;The very good animals weren’t the only things announced about &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday: Sucker Punch also released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBrAlSKqdAE"&gt;a trailer&lt;/a&gt; showing some of the story players will experience in the Iki Island expansion. While the story seems grim, Sucker Punch’s Patrick Downs describes it as “a story of healing” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/21/ghost-of-tsushima-journey-into-the-dark-secrets-of-iki-island/"&gt;in a post on the PlayStation Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now Salesforce officially owns Slack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GkmEd0FonYYsuRBwDH_iVSMQ0Ps=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614438/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yOPsJ"&gt;Cloud computing giant Salesforce has &lt;a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack"&gt;completed its acquisition of Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced"&gt;a $27.7 billion dollar deal&lt;/a&gt; that adds the messaging app to its suite of enterprise software without immediately changing Slack’s functionality, branding, or leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byea0z"&gt;Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement that “Together we’ll define the future of enterprise software, creating the digital HQ that enables every organization to deliver customer and employee success from anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVKolp"&gt;While Slack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5991005/slack-is-killing-email-yes-really"&gt;hasn’t quite killed email&lt;/a&gt;, it has attracted notice from giants like Microsoft, the company that Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield called “unhealthily preoccupied with killing us” in a conversation with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CdtuI5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield on competing with Microsoft, the future of work, and managing all those notifications ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21269875/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-interview-microsoft-remote-work-vergecast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="EIjMMu"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP1902792254&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3iBbN"&gt;“In a different universe where Slack is incredibly successful over the next two years and 98 percent of knowledge workers use Slack, it does matter to Microsoft because the relative importance of email is hugely diminished,” Butterfield said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLigwa"&gt;Now Slack is going from an upstart independent challenger to a consolidated competitor on even footing. As Box CEO Aaron Levie &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150313/how-microsoft-crushed-slack-salesforce-acquisition"&gt;said to Casey Newton after the deal was announced&lt;/a&gt;, “The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage...they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXabol"&gt;Salesforce has referred to its employees as architects of a remote-friendly approach, and with Slack in its pocket, it will try to dominate as other companies move in that direction. To answer the question on what’s next, on August 17th, Butterfield and Salesforce COO Bret Taylor are &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/events-master/digital-hq/?d=7013y000001zJ1JAAU"&gt;planning an event&lt;/a&gt; “to share more about how the two companies are creating a powerful platform for the digital-first, work anywhere world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gWzc8M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You may have heard there would come a day when Slack became a part of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/salesforce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out that day is today!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does this mean? We’re still the Slack you know and love—just a little better.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ak8bKx8wRl"&gt;https://t.co/Ak8bKx8wRl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Slack (@SlackHQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1417836740191076354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to check your phone for Pegasus spyware using Amnesty’s tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_wLLHhmJC-VeJv8XDk3AKGKcU3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614139/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UqlvLv"&gt;Amnesty International — part of the group that helped break the news of journalists and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/20/heads-of-state-pegasus-spyware/"&gt;heads of state&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;targeted by NSO’s government-grade spyware, Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; — has &lt;a href="https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt"&gt;released a tool&lt;/a&gt; to check if your phone has been affected. Alongside the tool is &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;a great set of instructions&lt;/a&gt;, which should help you through the somewhat technical checking process. Using the tool involves backing up your phone to a separate computer and running a check on that backup. Read on if you’ve been side-eyeing your phone since the news broke and are looking for guidance on using Amnesty’s tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5SXJL"&gt;The first thing to note is the tool is command line or terminal based, so it will take either some amount of technical skill or a bit of patience to run. We try to cover a lot of what you need to know to get up and running here, but it’s something to know before jumping in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ywv2yX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It will take some amount of technical skill or a bit of patience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBreVE"&gt;The second note is that the analysis Amnesty is running seems to work best for iOS devices. In its documentation, Amnesty says the analysis its tool can run on Android phone backups is limited, but the tool can still &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/backup.html"&gt;check for potentially malicious&lt;/a&gt; SMS messages &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/download_apks.html"&gt;and APKs&lt;/a&gt;. Again, we recommend &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/methodology.html"&gt;following its instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmhupe"&gt;To check your iPhone, the easiest way to start is by making &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220"&gt;an encrypted backup&lt;/a&gt; either &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977"&gt;using iTunes or Finder&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac or PC. You’ll then need to locate that backup, which &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215"&gt;Apple provides instructions&lt;/a&gt; for. Linux users can follow &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/backup/libimobiledevice.html"&gt;Amnesty’s instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to use the libimobiledevice command line tool to create a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxUBio"&gt;After getting a backup of your phone, you’ll then need to download and install Amnesty’s mvt program, which Amnesty &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html"&gt;also provides instructions&lt;/a&gt; for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iEJPR"&gt;If you’re using a Mac to run the check, you’ll first need to install both Xcode, which can be downloaded from the App Store, and Python3 before you can install and run mvt. The easiest way to obtain Python3 is using a &lt;a href="https://brew.sh"&gt;program called Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, which can be installed and run from the Terminal. After installing these, you’ll be ready to run through &lt;a href="https://mvt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ios/methodology.html"&gt;Amnesty’s iOS instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IVCsFf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll want to make sure your iPhone’s backup is encrypted with a password&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWO0z4"&gt;If you run into issues while trying to decrypt your backup, you’re not alone. The tool was giving me errors when I tried to point it to my backup, which was in the default folder. To solve this, I copied the backup folder from that default location into a folder on my desktop and pointed mvt to it. My command ended up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o83CmZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(For illustration purposes only. Please use commands from Amnesty’s instructions, as it’s possible the program has been updated.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5tlTpa"&gt;mvt-ios decrypt-backup -p PASSWORD -d decrypt ~/Desktop/bkp/orig &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="caHwTS"&gt;When running the actual scan, you’ll want to point to an Indicators of Compromise file, which &lt;a href="https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2021-07-18_nso"&gt;Amnesty provides&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a file called pegasus.stix2. Those who are brand-new to using the terminal may get tripped up on how to actually point to a file, but it’s relatively simple as long as you know where the file is. For beginners, I’d recommend downloading the stix2 file to your Mac’s Downloads folder. Then, when you get to the step where you’re actually running the check-backup command, add &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WKtKXZ"&gt;-i ~/Downloads/pegasus.stix2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="N4wKqT"&gt;into the option section. For reference, my command ended up looking like this. (Again, this is for illustration purposes only. Trying to copy these commands and run them will result in an error):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CzbLbd"&gt;mvt-ios check-backup -o logs --iocs ~/Downloads/pegasus.stix2 ~/Desktop/bkp/decrypt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kd2wwX"&gt;(For reference, the ~/ is more or less acting as a shortcut to your user folder, so you don’t have to add in something like /Users/mitchell.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8sBH8"&gt;Again, I’d recommend following along with Amnesty’s instructions and using its commands, as it’s always possible that the tool will have been updated. Security researcher @RayRedacted on Twitter also has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RayRedacted/status/1417829244869222400?s=20"&gt;a great thread&lt;/a&gt; going through some of the issues you may run into while running the tool and how to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wFqPLX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The investigation didn’t find evidence that US phones had been breached by Pegasus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XxMHIq"&gt;As a final note, Amnesty only provides instructions for installing the tool on macOS and Linux systems. For those looking to run it on Windows, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has confirmed the tool can be used by &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10"&gt;installing and using Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt; (WSL) and following Amnesty’s Linux instructions. Using WSL will require downloading and installing a Linux distro, like Ubuntu, which will take some time. It can, however, be done while you wait for your phone to backup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUBVfU"&gt;After running mvt, you’ll see a list of warnings that either list suspicious files or behavior. It’s worth noting that a warning doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve been infected. For me, some redirects that were totally above board showed up in the section where it checked my Safari history (sheets.google.com redirecting to docs.google.com, reut.rs redirecting to reuters.com, etc). Likewise, I got a few errors, but only because the program was checking for apps that I don’t have installed on my phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3bTEI"&gt;The story around Pegasus has likely left many of us regarding our phones with a bit more suspicion than usual, regardless of whether we’re likely to be targeted by a nation-state. While running the tool could (hopefully) help to ease some fears, it’s probably not a necessary precaution for many Americans. NSO Group has said its software cannot be used on phones with US numbers, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/?itid=hp_alert"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the investigation didn’t find any evidence that US phones had been successfully breached by Pegasus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7yEJK"&gt;While it’s nice to see that Amnesty made this tool available with solid documentation, it only really helps to address the privacy concerns around Pegasus. As we’ve seen recently, it doesn’t take a government targeting your phone’s microphone and camera to get private information — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029992/smartphone-location-tracking-legal-technology-privacy-new-york-times"&gt;data broker industry&lt;/a&gt; could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22586161/cell-phone-location-data-grindr-catholic-church-report-data-brokers"&gt;selling your location history&lt;/a&gt; even if your phone is Pegasus-free.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new athlete wellness trend just dropped</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 U.S. Olympic Track &amp;amp;amp; Field Team Trials - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N-oiFJLbT37PgVnC1tGZPpyYxAQ=/0x0:5303x3535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69614057/1324406292.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmVuy4"&gt;Athletes love a good wellness trend. Anything that promises to boost performance or give the slightest edge to anyone competing at the highest level of their sport &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evqe3z/why-its-so-easy-for-athletes-to-buy-into-junk-science"&gt;is going to find the ears&lt;/a&gt; of elite athletes and Olympians — even (or especially) if it looks like a torture device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAcBuW"&gt;In 2016, the fad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/8/12402038/olympics-2016-cupping-therapy-cryotheraphy-kinesio-tape-fads"&gt;was cupping&lt;/a&gt;: a technique that used suction cups as pain relief, leaving athletes like Michael Phelps looking like they’d just fought off a giant octopus. This year, its blood flow restriction, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/sports/olympics/athletes-blood-flow-restriction.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Some swimmers and runners are applying tourniquet-like bands to their arms and legs in the hopes that it’ll boost their training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd93hA"&gt;The strategy was first developed in 1966 by Japanese powerlifter Yoshiaki Sato, but it’s only just &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a34096061/blood-flow-restriction-training-science/"&gt;caught on&lt;/a&gt; with high-profile athletes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the past few years. American swimmer Michael Andrew and Galen Rupp, an American distance runner, are both using blood flow restriction during Olympic training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xOpQa"&gt;Like any good performance-enhancing trend, there’s still only limited evidence showing if or how it works. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26118847/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show that athletes like rugby, football, and netball players increased their muscle strength and endurance after training with blood flow restriction for a few weeks. It could boost strength by increasing stress on muscle cells, which promotes muscle development, researchers speculate. But there have only been a few research studies on the technique. “Only 9 studies exist on this topic, making concrete conclusions tentative,” wrote the authors of one 2015 &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2015/06000/is_blood_flow_restriction_training_beneficial_for.5.aspx"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pX3sIt"&gt;That’s been the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/8/12402038/olympics-2016-cupping-therapy-cryotheraphy-kinesio-tape-fads"&gt;for other tools&lt;/a&gt;, like cupping and Kinesio tape, which athletes have stretched across joints to try to avoid injuries or prevent pain. The benefits of strategies like these are hard to prove, and athletes tend to adopt them based on anecdotal evidence from peers or if they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they help — regardless of concrete evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSiY3l"&gt;At the end of the day, though, maybe that’s fine. The placebo effect is powerful, and sports are as much mental as they are physical. There’s a risk that having high-profile athletes put so much emphasis on unproven tools might spread misinformation or distract from good sports science, John Sullivan, a clinical psychologist and sport scientist, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evqe3z/why-its-so-easy-for-athletes-to-buy-into-junk-science"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Blood flow restriction may not be something that people can or should do at home: the equipment is &lt;a href="https://www.smarttoolsplus.com/detail.cfm/id/398/name/smartcuffs?rfsn=2703477.8bcb0b"&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.issaonline.com%2Fblog%2Findex.cfm%2F2020%2Fblood-flow-restriction-training-what-trainers-need-to-know&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F21%2F22587574%2Fblood-flow-restriction-athlete-performance-trend" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be dangerous&lt;/a&gt; if not done correctly. But for elite athletes under the constant supervision of sports scientists, as long as a strategy doesn’t hurt, believing that it helps might actually be enough to give them an edge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Khalid’s latest music video is a big, sloppy kiss to Silicon Valley </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHBF8Q1GfJwBqsg1TzhEgLLVeqc=/43x0:679x424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613786/khalid_1.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcIMoz"&gt;Grammy-nominated singer Khalid has a new album coming out, and the first single, “New Normal,” is as smooth and breezy as a summer afternoon, which is weird because the video that accompanies the track is pretty much a venture capitalist’s dream come true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIpiNF"&gt;The video depicts a futuristic utopia full of skyscraper gardens, autonomous vehicles, drone deliveries, and smart homes. Khalid’s video is brimming with real products from real companies, not generic versions — a sign that the singer maybe had some input from Silicon Valley in crafting his love letter to our &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/"&gt;surveillance capitalist nightmare of a future&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BR4o2n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The video depicts a futuristic utopia full of skyscraper gardens, autonomous vehicles, drone deliveries, and smart homes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gWadvc"&gt;You know things are off to an interesting start when Khalid, rocking some sick blueish purple hair, rolls up to his apartment in a robotaxi from autonomous vehicle startup Zoox. The company, which is owned by Amazon, only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;just unveiled the toaster-shaped driverless shuttle&lt;/a&gt; last December. It’s not even available to the public yet, but in Khalid’s imagined future, the road is teeming with Zoox shuttles — and only Zoox shuttles. (I was tipped off to the video by a PR representative from Zoox, but have yet to receive a reply as to whether the company paid for the product placement.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJRghN9AnbmNV9efK3ps0aDFSi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731443/khalid_1.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BZdGCv"&gt;As Khalid dances through the interior of LA’s Bradbury Building (&lt;a href="https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/things-to-do/discover-blade-runner-locations-in-los-angeles"&gt;made famous by &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a more realistic version of the future), other people are inserting packages into drones that buzz around the building’s vast atrium. Why are the drones inside the building? Won’t they just smash into the skylight? Is there some kind of rooftop portal for the drones that managed to get installed despite the Bradbury Building’s designation as a national historical landmark in 1977? These and other questions go unanswered as Khalid continues to lazily shimmy through the song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1O0oR2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The singer then enters what I can only describe as a sanitized version of Korben Dallas’ apartment in ‘The Fifth Element’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cv9kdP"&gt;The singer then enters what I can only describe as a sanitized version of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amiJFKChM8E"&gt;Korben Dallas’ apartment in &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (another more accurate depiction of our chaotic and punitive future compared to this). The room is barely bigger than a closet, but the walls are lined with hydroponic plants, which I guess is supposed to make us feel better about living in what’s basically a well-lit coffin. Khalid uses a spray bottle to water his plants. We still have spray bottles in the future! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEWb6W"&gt;But maybe I spoke too soon, because the next shot shows us an automatic watering system activated by Khalid’s PS5. Again, this raises a lot of questions: how far into the future can this be, if he still has a PS5? Maybe he’s into retro consoles? And why would the PS5 be controlling his water filtration system? Is it now a smart home hub? I’m so confused. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4fk8gBzLBCAseqtOlb7eqD-AP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731474/khalid_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5BkUZ"&gt;Outside, swarms of knee-high delivery robots jockey for space on the sidewalk. The marketing team at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus"&gt;Starship Technologies&lt;/a&gt; must be kicking themselves over their failure to get their brand name in this video. Khalid sings into some sort of smart home panel on his wall, and his vocals are transmitted through the delivery robots apparently. Not sure how I feel about sidewalk robots that sing while also trampling our toes, but let’s move on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rgY3XP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only the finest fintech for our guy Khalid. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R977qU"&gt;Then, in what appears to be a particularly shameless moment of product placement, the singer remotely pays for something on his smart home panel (for what? it’s unclear) using Chime, a startup said to be worth $14.5 billion. Does anyone actually use Chime? Khalid sure does. Who needs the Cash app? Only the finest fintech for our guy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBir8i"&gt;As the video winds down, we end on the image of Khalid opening his blinds to see a giant billboard outside his window advertising rocket trips. It’s a little unclear what the ad is selling. A 90-minute rocket trip to the moon would be really, really fast. Probably too fast for any of the quasi-realistic tech featured in this video. Is it point-to-point commercial rocket travel between LA and New York, in the vein of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16385026/elon-musk-spacex-rocket-transportation-point-to-point"&gt;Elon Musk’s aborted idea&lt;/a&gt; from a couple years ago? If that was the case, 90 minutes would be too long. Is Khalid’s record label, RCA, sponsoring these rocket trips? Color me skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8U57n5EgaVJlW-krDSuqDUHlac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731498/Screen_Shot_2021_07_21_at_3.11.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w9Xxq7"&gt;Khalid’s unabashed love for Silicon Valley culture shouldn’t be that surprising. After all, the singer debuted his single “New Normal” during a live performance at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceflight launch&lt;/a&gt;, which sent Virgin CEO Richard Branson to the very edge of space. He clearly has a soft spot for huge, multinational companies seeking to alter the fabric of our reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LytE4"&gt;But while the video may be unrestrained in its romantic feelings for Big Tech’s quest to dominate our lives, the lyrics are actually a little more nuanced, even kind of defeatist. “Although I can’t promise you much / You’ll be finе, you’ll be fine,” Khalid croons. I really hope that turns out to be true. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing upvote and downvote buttons on tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_M1P-MIn06kHVxc6AYomsZa_Kk=/623x0:3473x1900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69613644/E613I_0WEAQh4r0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sBuV18"&gt;Twitter is working on new upvote and downvote reactions for tweets to accompany the usual options to retweet and reply. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?s=20"&gt;Twitter confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was testing the feature for a small group of users on iOS, and it’s already been spotted according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iglehart97/status/1417912630996574208?s=20"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danlopez016/status/1417913141397127168?s=20"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from users that are part of the test group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDaPM5"&gt;Twitter writes that iOS users may see upvote and downvotes in several different styles (up and down arrows, a heart icon and a down arrow, and thumbs up and thumbs down icons) and that it’s testing the feature to “understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them.” Currently votes are not public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m0fQh5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some of you on iOS may see different options to up or down vote on replies. We're testing this to understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo, so we can work on ways to show more of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your downvotes aren’t public, while your upvotes will be shown as likes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hrBfrKQdcY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hrBfrKQdcY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DqFZrD"&gt;While Twitter hasn’t said if it plans to add up and down voting as a permanent feature (or how voting affects what you see in your feed), there are clear parallels to be drawn to Reddit, which features upvoting and downvoting as a way of surfacing a subreddit’s favorite replies, responses, and posts. Twitter says that for now though upvotes and downvotes don’t impact the order of tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0GXxh"&gt;Twitter’s toyed with other kinds of tweet interactions in the past, including reactions that &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;appeared to mimic the emoji reactions&lt;/a&gt; Facebook uses for Facebook posts and Messenger messages. Twitter’s product lead Kayvon Beykpour has also said that the company planned to work on dislikes last year, claiming the feature was one of Twitter’s many “top priorities” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392?s=20"&gt;in response to a user’s tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
