    <title>How to keep some of your Twitter data away from advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zs5eSG006hIp6CIU2Eg0nsrU2g=/137x0:763x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455393/Twitter-block.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can’t keep Twitter out of your data completely, but you can lessen the damage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HDn6QQ"&gt;In April 2020, Twitter began sharing more of your information with advertisers. Notice came via a rather weird notification that said “your ability to control mobile app advertising measurements has been removed” — which basically meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213593/twitter-data-sharing-pop-up-mobile-app-advertising-settings"&gt;Twitter was now sharing data&lt;/a&gt; such as which ads you looked at or interacted with, as well as the tracking identifier for your phone. Previously, you could turn that off — no longer. (Unless you live in the European Union or the UK, where there are extra protections.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter removed some of its privacy protections back on April, 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeS_u0XJB0UY1SerbX0c2VJ_59g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659847/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.25.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter removed some of its privacy protections in April 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrg9J2"&gt;While that protection has been removed, there are still a few privacy tools available that can give you at least some measure of say over how much of your data is shared with advertisers. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth it to take a few minutes to find them and turn them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXpKGc"&gt;There is a single page on the web where you can find a lot of the settings, called the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account/personalization"&gt;Personalization and data&lt;/a&gt;” page. Unfortunately, that page no longer seems to be available on the mobile app. So while we’ll initially discuss the settings as found on the web page, I’ll also tell you how to get to each feature on mobile. (To get to any of the mobile settings, you’ll always start by tapping on your personal icon in the upper left corner.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZZUCLB02fnkc5Cg51cBnkbMINI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025630/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses advertisers have to your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qtz9zr"&gt;Disabling ad personalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lVRFAY"&gt;On the “Personalization and data” page, you’ll find several advertising settings that give Twitter permission to “further personalize” your advertising by using information based on your “inferred identity,” location, or other factors. (Go ahead and read all the descriptions — they’re worth knowing about.) You can choose to enable any of these settings if you wish, but otherwise, use the toggle at the top of the page to disable all of the settings on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNsoti"&gt;If you’re using the mobile app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bou6OE"&gt;Find “Personalized ads” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Ads preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zJi3kO"&gt;Find “Personalize based on your inferred identity” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ajPoAd"&gt;Find “Personalize based on places you’ve been” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NZfBbK"&gt;Find “Allow use of where you see Twitter content across the web” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9vXMOx"&gt;Find “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Data sharing with business partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M6gpp3"&gt;Find “Personalize based on precise location” (which is not available on the web settings) by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dayz7F"&gt;See your Twitter data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzZHy"&gt;If you’d like to go a little further, and check the other data that Twitter knows about you (and possibly remove at least some of it), go down to the bottom of the “Personalization and data” page and click on “See your Twitter data.” Check all of these topics out; you may be surprised by some of the info that’s there. Here’s a short summary of each (along with directions if you’re using the mobile app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e6mcaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account. &lt;/strong&gt;This is all basic stuff, like your name, age range, whether you have a verified account, and what other languages you speak. (I was amused to find that Twitter thinks I speak German. Okay, Twitter, whatever.) In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Account information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hwclF3"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account history. &lt;/strong&gt;This contains two separate areas: a listing of other accounts that have access to your account, and a listing of places you have been. It’s a good idea to check the former to see if there are any services that have access to your account and shouldn’t; you can revoke permission on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"&gt;Connected apps&lt;/a&gt; page. If you don’t want Twitter to know where you are or where you’ve been, use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location_information"&gt;Location settings&lt;/a&gt; to turn off access. In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OzGMLr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apps, devices &amp;amp; information.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sections here. “Apps, devices &amp;amp; information” is where you might find some of the devices and browsers that Twitter gets info from — assuming you allow it to. This is what Twitter meant when it asked to “Personalize based on your inferred identity” on the “Personalization and data page,” and it is one of the permissions that can be revoked there. The second, “Connected apps,” is another way to access several of the pages already mentioned here. This info can also be found in your mobile app under: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyjvtP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account activity. &lt;/strong&gt;This&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lets you see what accounts you’ve blocked or muted. On your mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Mute and block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLh0uFDEVnMduIatE8w4GIZbzT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025633/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Jnfnqh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interests and ad data. &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s a section you may spend a lot of time with, especially with “Interests from Twitter,” which tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity. If you plan on reviewing this thoroughly, put aside a few minutes: one of my Twitter accounts had 742 interests listed, including quite a few weird ones. As someone who has no interest in sports, I’d love to know how Twitter came up with “NBA videos” as an interest of mine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s8g5Hl"&gt;The other two categories here, “Inferred interests from partners” and “Tailored audiences,” can be disabled using the “Personalization and data” page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t find anything similar using the mobile app, but you can go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Content you see &amp;gt; Topics. There you’ll see some of the topics you’ve followed and that Twitter suggests you might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KeiiPf"&gt;Finally, “Download archive” lets you download the archive of your account history and activity. In your mobile app, go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Your account &amp;gt; Download an archive of your data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WcYWPm"&gt;Want to be really safe? You may want to just bite the bullet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete your Twitter history &lt;/a&gt;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create an NFT — and why you may not want to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkKWEwsQSLqb8kGv8XvL5IqIVVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244016/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fPTC9c"&gt;NFTs have been a cultural phenomenon throughout 2021, constantly making headlines as celebrities dabble in the space and as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;shenanigans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787216/miramax-pulp-fiction-quentin-tarantino-nft-lawsuit"&gt;legal fights&lt;/a&gt; ensue. With some creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;making millions off NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, though, it’s understandable why you’d want to try your hand at it or play around with the tech to get a better feel for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhOagU"&gt;We’re going to go over how to create an NFT using two of the most popular marketplaces, but before we get to that point, let’s cover some of the basics of what an NFT is and the decisions you may have to make before deciding to sell one. (If you’re relatively up to speed, you can go to Step 3 to begin the journey of actually creating a token.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H0qHxS"&gt;Step 1: Figure out what an NFT is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LraD0i"&gt;Listen, there’s no judgment if you’ve arrived here without much understanding of what NFTs are. Maybe a friend said, “Hey, you should sell that picture of your cat as an NFT.” But before you go through the process of creating and selling one, it’s probably best to have some idea about what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OnNA0i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MdUSlV"&gt;We have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;entire explainer going into NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and the culture around them, as well as an explainer on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;the blockchain technology that NFTs use&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t have to study every word in them, but the rest of this guide will make references to things like Ethereum, proof of work, and other similar concepts that you’ll get a better understanding of by reading our explainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aro9V1"&gt;Here’s a quick TL;DR, though. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital tokens stored on the blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies, where each coin is the same (there’s no reason to prefer one particular Bitcoin over another), each NFT is unique and can be sold as a way to prove ownership over some sort of digital file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3Dj6YF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFT artwork is almost never actually stored on the blockchain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GhUhwa"&gt;In almost every case, the files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;aren’t actually stored on the blockchain itself&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, a link to the file is stored, along with the token that acts as proof of ownership over whatever that link points to. There’s also no rule saying that two or more NFTs can’t exist for the same file — you can have NFTs with editions, kind of like trading cards. For example, an NFT can be rare because there are only 10 copies or common because thousands of the same NFT have been “minted,” or written to the blockchain. There’s also nothing to stop someone from taking the file you’ve used for your NFT and creating their own NFT with it (though the blockchain entry will show that it came from their account, not yours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuOLLp"&gt;You can technically sell any digital file as an NFT, but if you’re looking to use a marketplace’s easy minting tools, you’re going to be limited to the formats they support. We’ll touch on that a bit more later, but it’s worth keeping in mind that your first NFT should probably be an image, video, or audio clip of some sort. If you don’t know what you want to sell as an NFT yet, those kinds of restrictions could help you narrow down the possibilities. With that said...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RBq1rT"&gt;Step 2: Make sure you actually want to sell an NFT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZI5YKH"&gt;If you just have the vague idea that you want to make an NFT because seemingly everyone is doing it, there are a few considerations you may want to take into account. The first big one is transaction fees. While the platforms that we’ll cover today will let you create NFTs for free, selling them could be a different matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E34Y4R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can end up sinking a lot of money into the business before selling a single NFT&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2h8qL"&gt;Most NFTs are sold on the Ethereum blockchain (we’ll touch on ones that aren’t in the next section), and every transaction on the Ethereum blockchains costs fees that are paid to the miners. These fees &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp"&gt;are called “gas,”&lt;/a&gt; and the amount of gas you need for a transaction (and therefore how much that transaction will cost) can vary significantly. Almost everything you do on the blockchain, from minting an NFT to transferring it to someone else to bidding to purchase one, will cost gas (though there are some ways around this for creating NFTs, which we’ll go over in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxxKFQ"&gt;It’s also worth noting that paying gas &lt;strong&gt;does not 100 percent guarantee your transfer will go through&lt;/strong&gt;. You can pay more to give yourself a higher chance, but it is never a sure thing. To be clear, most transactions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; likely to go through. However, if something does happen and your transaction isn’t completed, you &lt;a href="https://legacy.ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit/"&gt;won’t get the gas fees you paid back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ttvg1"&gt;Then there’s the environmental aspect of NFTs. The most popular (and easiest to use) NFT marketplaces mostly run on the Ethereum blockchain, which uses an energy-intensive “proof of work” system (you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;more about what that means here&lt;/a&gt;). While there’s debate on whether individually selling NFTs &lt;a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/nft-carbon-environmental-impact-1234589742/"&gt;has an effect on the overall energy use of the blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, if your NFTs are built on Ethereum, you are making use of a system that has a big carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5monsi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The climate controversy swirling around NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="i0mPUZ"&gt;There are blockchains that use alternate systems that don’t use as much energy, and Ethereum has plans to move to a more efficient proof of stake system at some point in the future. However, that’s not the case yet, which is one of the reasons people might get upset when others decide to sell NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dq3EzB"&gt;Step 3: Choose a platform to sell your NFT on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1ftzWN"&gt;There are dozens of platforms that let you sell NFTs across a wide variety of blockchains, so it’s almost impossible for any single guide to cover them all, much less tell you which one is the right one for your project. We’ll be covering two of the more popular marketplaces in this guide, but do know that there are alternatives if neither of these platforms fit what you want to do, like &lt;a href="https://wax.atomichub.io"&gt;AtomicHub&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the Wax blockchain, or the &lt;a href="https://solsea.io"&gt;Solana-based Solsea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDP3mv"&gt;It’s also worth noting at this point that our guide will show you how to do things the basic way. Even with NFT markets, there are deep rabbit holes you can go down that won’t be covered in this guide (things like selling an NFT minted with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723092/opensea-nft-vulnerability-gift-security-researchers-wallet-hack"&gt;OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; on Rarible, programmatically generating collections like Bored Apes, and so on). Just know that this isn’t meant to be a comprehensive compendium on selling NFTs — it’s just getting you to the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAVMFL"&gt;Both OpenSea and Rarible let you create NFTs on Ethereum without paying anything, thanks to what they call &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-collection-manager/"&gt;“lazy minting” systems&lt;/a&gt;. Lazy minting lets you create an NFT and put it up for sale without it actually being written to the blockchain, thus avoiding any fees. When someone actually buys it, the fees for writing your NFT to the blockchain will be bundled with the fees to transfer it to the buyer. That helps you avoid the situation where you pay $10 to $30 (or more!) to mint an NFT that no one ends up buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XXz9QA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it comes to minting NFTs, most options have some sort of trade-off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBVDns"&gt;There can be catches — with OpenSea, listing your first Ethereum NFT for sale &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500003246262-What-fees-do-I-pay-for-my-first-listing-"&gt;will require initializing your account&lt;/a&gt;, which can be an expensive transaction (during testing, I saw prices in the $300 to $400 range). It is a one-time fee, and after paying it, you’ll be able to lazy mint NFTs without having to pay anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0RyQd"&gt;With Rarible, I didn’t have to pay this sort of fee during my testing. However, trying to remove your NFT from sale will cost a fee (I saw prices around $20 to $30). Both Rarible and OpenSea will take a 2.5 percent fee from any sales you make — if you sell an NFT for 0.025 ETH, you’ll actually receive 0.024375 ETH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnal9w"&gt;There are, however, alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain. Rarible &lt;a href="https://rarible.medium.com/rarible-com-and-rarible-protocol-integrate-flow-blockchain-for-streamlined-nft-experience-80b624364c37"&gt;lets you sell NFTs using the Flow blockchain&lt;/a&gt; (the same one used by NBA Top Shot) if you sign up for it using the Blocto wallet, and OpenSea will &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404029357587-How-do-I-create-and-sell-NFTs-on-Polygon-"&gt;let you sell using the Polygon blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. Both options have much lower fees than those you pay for using the Ethereum blockchain, if any fees at all, so we will at least touch on using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aQu0oT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heads up! The Polygon blockchain has nothing to do with &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.polygon.com" target="_blank"&gt;Vox Media’s gaming-focused outlet &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw8dOX"&gt;As you might have guessed, if there were no catches or downsides to these low / no-fee blockchains, everyone would be using them. At the time of writing, choosing to use Flow on Rarible will limit you to single edition NFTs (one of ones), and you won’t be able to sell them with an auction. Additionally, when you’re using non-Ethereum blockchains like Flow or Polygon, people &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012889322-How-do-I-purchase-NFTs-on-Polygon-"&gt;can’t use Ethereum to purchase your NFTs&lt;/a&gt; (at least, not without going through extra, fee-inducing steps). While both platforms do let buyers add funds to their wallet to complete a purchase, having to convert or outright buy another cryptocurrency to nab your NFT may put some collectors off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQEkpy"&gt;(Note: while Polygon does let you use Ethereum, it’s actually Polygon’s version of Ethereum. You can directly transfer Ethereum from its main blockchain over to Polygon and transfer back, but doing so will incur gas fees.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kREX7g"&gt;Do I have to use a marketplace site to create an NFT?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AZeRTt"&gt;Technically, no. You can &lt;a href="https://dzone.com/articles/steps-to-create-test-and-deploy-ethereum-smart-con"&gt;create your own smart contract&lt;/a&gt;, deploy it to the blockchain of your choice, and then mint your own tokens using it. That’s jumping into the deep end, though, and probably not the route you’ll want to go unless you’re very technical. Most people will want to use one of the platforms discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bvxeYQ"&gt;Step 4: Set up a wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lzoKda"&gt;Wallets are the applications you use to store your cryptocurrencies, as well as any NFTs you end up minting or buying. Coinbase has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Flearn%2Fcrypto-basics%2Fwhat-is-a-crypto-wallet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22809090%2Fnft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a more in-depth explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how wallets work and the different options that are available, but if you’re just getting started, there’s really one main thing you need to worry about: using a wallet that’s compatible with the blockchain you’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsyeCO"&gt;MetaMask’s wallet is one of the wallets that’s widely supported by Ethereum-based applications like OpenSea, Foundation, and others and can be used either as a &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; extension or as an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask/id1438144202?_branch_match_id=969078228885309776&amp;amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz00tScxNLM7WSywo0MvJzMvWL8529DB2SnSztAQA5G46IyQAAAA%3D"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;ref=producthunt&amp;amp;_branch_match_id=969078228885309776&amp;amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz00tScxNLM7WSywo0MvJzMvWT6ooz3a1yHeztAQA%2FOIqTSQAAAA%3D"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; app. Coinbase also has its own wallet that you can use as an extension or an app, and it’s supported by most platforms. You may want to consider Coinbase’s wallet if you’re planning on getting into crypto more broadly, as it has support for blockchains not based on Ethereum, like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WLbPF"&gt;MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet’s setup processes are similar. Once you have the browser extension or app installed (MetaMask can be &lt;a href="https://metamask.io/download.html"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase Wallet &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fwallet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22809090%2Fnft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), click or tap the “Create new wallet” button. Coinbase will ask you for a username, and both will ask you for a password, which you’ll want to make sure is secure (preferably by generating it with and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;saving it in a password manager&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cfTvZhiA6igBqhw06Q8plgIk-JE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069608/Screen_Shot_2021_11_30_at_16.51.49.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep your seed phrase as secure as you possibly can — both from prying eyes and the possibility of loss. Do not post it, even a blurred version of it, on the internet (as I am doing).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ur8ux"&gt;Finally, both MetaMask and Coinbase will give you what’s known as a “seed phrase,” which is 12 random words. It’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important not to lose this, as it will let you recover your account if you, say, uninstall the app or need to set up your wallet on a new device. It’s a good idea to copy it and store it in a very safe location, such as a physical safe or password manager (or both). MetaMask will ask you to repeat the phrase back, while Coinbase Wallet will ask you if you want to store an encrypted copy of it on the cloud if you set it up using the app. If you’re setting Coinbase up with the extension or you choose to manually back it up instead of saving it to the cloud, it’ll be the same process as MetaMask, where you’ll have to re-enter the phrase manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRa1AJ"&gt;If you lose your password and / or security phrase, you’ll be out of luck with both MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet — neither company can do anything to help you. That means you’ll lose access to any cryptocurrency or NFTs stored in that wallet, as well as the accounts that you’ve set up using it. So seriously, &lt;strong&gt;keep your password and secret phrase safe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suoJc4"&gt;Finally, you’ll have access to your wallet, which won’t have anything in it yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kd78Vw"&gt;Step 5: Connect your wallet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dKro9h"&gt;After you’ve got your wallet set up, you’ll want to connect it with the NFT marketplace you plan on using. OpenSea and Rarible make this easy — clicking the Create button in the top left prompts you to connect your wallet. You’ll then be presented with a list of compatible wallets, and choosing yours will prompt you to go through the connection process. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwroWfIAHTWnuNoOmbxEh0yM_Gk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069609/Screen_Shot_2021_11_30_at_16.54.11.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connecting an account with MetaMask is simple if you have the browser extension installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="busXzQ"&gt;If you have Metamask or Coinbase’s extension installed, you’ll see a pop-up asking you if you want to connect your wallet, which can be done with a few button clicks. If you’re using the Coinbase Wallet app, you can also connect to the marketplace by using the QR code scanner (which you can find to the right of your balance on the main wallet screen).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gxpOEBzgYNEjO05I01hqhLShk9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069622/Untitled_Project_5_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QR button in the Coinbase Wallet app lets you scan a QR code to connect to NFT marketplaces or other apps that require a wallet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z9bGoj"&gt;A word of caution for the future: be careful if you see a request to connect to your wallet when you don’t expect it, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723092/opensea-nft-vulnerability-gift-security-researchers-wallet-hack"&gt;scammers could be trying to access your funds or NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. As long as you’re on a trusted site, you should generally be okay (at least, as long as something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814849/badgerdao-defi-120-million-hack-bitcoin-ethereum"&gt;isn’t very wrong&lt;/a&gt; — be sure to check transactions to make sure they’re kosher). But if an unknown site asks to connect to your wallet, you should probably think twice before accepting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HufqcB"&gt;Step 6: Create an NFT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j87Fmz"&gt;After you’ve connected your wallet, you’ll arrive at the page you use to create an NFT (and if you don’t end up there, you can get there by clicking the Create button that both platforms put in the upper right-hand corner). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxWL1V"&gt;Before we start creating our NFTs, a word on collections — both platforms support collections, which are pretty much what they sound like. If you want to create a series of NFTs, you can use a collection to do so — on Rarible, you can create one right from the NFT creation screen, which the NFT you’re making will be added to. On OpenSea, you’ll have to go to your profile picture in the top right, then go to My Collections &amp;gt; Create a collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOChYA"&gt;We won’t cover collections in this guide, but OpenSea will automatically place the NFT you create into an unnamed collection if you don’t specify one (you can either edit the collection later or move the NFT to another collection), and Rarible lets you sell an NFT as a Rarible Single without a collection.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCNUY3"&gt;Now, let’s finally get started on our NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e5ljot"&gt;Listing an NFT on OpenSea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jvqbMQ"&gt;After clicking the Create button, you’ll be brought to the create new item page. To start, click the box with an image icon in it, which will let you upload the file you’ll be selling as an NFT (though, do make sure to take note of the file size and type limitations noted above the selector). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mImeyM"&gt;After you’ve added your file, give it a name, or title. You can also use the External Link field to add a URL pointing to, say, your website or Twitter account, and you can use the Description field to give potential buyers a better idea of what your NFT is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_o3q2c2wCUBmrw6n-BFCVC7TdQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069597/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.12.12.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some file types, like videos or music, will ask for a second “preview” image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88mM63"&gt;Underneath those fields, you can choose a collection for your NFT if you’ve set one up, as well as add properties, levels, or stats that can basically act as metadata. If you’re selling an NFT that could act as a video game character, for instance, this is where you’d put in their information. If you’re selling a piece of art, you could use the properties panel to add information about it, such as the medium, year, etc. However, all these fields are optional, so a lot of people will probably be able to ignore them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpgi1e"&gt;OpenSea also lets you add text that acts as unlockable content, which the buyer / owner of the NFT will be able to see. You could use this toggle-able field to include something like an invite link to a private Discord, a code to redeem something on an external website, or even just a message thanking them for buying. You can also use the explicit and sensitive content toggle if your NFT is NSFW in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHAM78XaxMd7cJtilNz_Z7ezi9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069599/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.12.26.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure to pay close attention to which blockchain you’re minting on — you can’t change it later, and it could have a drastic effect on the fees you pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3HVUEJ"&gt;After those toggles and fields is the dropdown you use to select which blockchain you’re minting your NFT to — the Ethereum chain or the Polygon one. You can see Step 3 for more information on the pros and cons of each, but we’re going to go with Polygon for our example, as it &lt;a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404029357587-How-do-I-create-and-sell-NFTs-on-Polygon-"&gt;currently doesn’t require paying any fees&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re minting with Polygon, you’ll also have the option to mint multiple copies of your NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7X9JS"&gt;After you’ve chosen your blockchain, you’ll want to double-check everything. OpenSea lets you change the metadata afterward as long as you haven’t put it up for sale, but it’s good practice to make sure everything’s shipshape before doing anything blockchain-related. And note that you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be able to change which blockchain the NFT is on after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFR7zU"&gt;After you’re good to go, you can click the Create button. Depending on the options you’ve selected and what kind of file you’re selling as an NFT, there might be a bit of a wait as things upload. After it finishes, you’ll see a screen saying that your NFT was created.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiiDVNMNaOLFZZdjG5rUJ3_XUmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069596/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.17.15.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our NFT is on OpenSea but not written to the blockchain yet — that won’t happen until someone purchases it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aL9PdB"&gt;However, your NFT isn’t actually up for sale on OpenSea yet — to do that, you’ll have to click off of the congratulations screen to get to your NFT’s page (you can also get to it by clicking on your profile picture, clicking on the Created tab, and selecting the NFT). On the NFT’s page, there’ll be a Sell button. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VWR5dzyh8ZRo3iR38b_ipf4Hdo4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069628/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_00.00.31.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This NFT has been created, but isn’t for sale — to list it, click the Sell button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YaGGNp"&gt;With NFTs listed on Ethereum or Polygon, you’ll have the option to create a listing for a fixed price, and on Ethereum, you’ll have the option to create a timed auction as well. For a fixed price listing, you’ll simply put in the amount that you want to sell the item for (listed in Ethereum, but it’ll give you an approximate dollar amount below) and choose how long you want the listing to be available for. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/imEt8ti0WIYvOWZhbsfROVHjygc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23068156/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.20.38.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenSea’s Polygon implementation only supports fixed-price sales at time of writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KsmBG1"&gt;Since the NFT will be available to purchase as soon as you list it, you can also make it only available to a specific buyer using the “More options” dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj2AcP"&gt;To list your NFT for sale, click the “Complete listing” button. You’ll have to confirm, or sign, a few transactions with your wallet, either using the browser extension or the app. On Polygon, the transactions are free, and you’ll get a screen saying that your item’s been listed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fNSQJCN-TPLfllUDiODGd_L4vaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069594/IMG_3285.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example signature request in the Coinbase Wallet app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F5i0Z5"&gt;On Ethereum, if it’s your first NFT, you’ll have to do a one-time approval transaction to “initialize” your wallet, which we discussed above. To do so, you’ll need to have Ethereum in your wallet. Buying crypto could be its own separate explainer, but &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/how-to-buy-ethereum-a-beginners-guide-to-buying-eth"&gt;here’s a guide to get you started&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICra7f"&gt;The money for this transaction is only going towards gas, not a fee for OpenSea, so how much it costs depends entirely on how much Ethereum’s gas fees are at the moment. In my tests, I saw prices from around $240 to $450, so if it’s very high, you may want to wait until the price drops — you can use &lt;a href="https://ethgasstation.info"&gt;a site like Ethereum Gas Station&lt;/a&gt; to monitor transaction costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9k5NpF01ta1lH_dqZJTAeF8Dlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069595/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_13.29.35.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Registering to use Ethereum with OpenSea can be expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kGNOeV"&gt;After you’ve approved and signed all the transactions, your NFT will be listed for sale on OpenSea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hX5cp3"&gt;Listing an NFT on Rarible&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/duw1kGEIj4fhMwnWMskzv4O4z_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069629/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_00.02.11.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rarible starts you with an option right off the bat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TSgqDh"&gt;The first question Rarible will ask is whether you want to create a single-edition NFT or a multiple-edition NFT — in other words, whether you want to create a one-of-one NFT, or one that’s limited edition but can be purchased by multiple people. The screens you’ll end up on are largely similar (though you can only use Ethereum if you’re creating a multiple-edition, and you’ll have to specify the number of copies you want to sell), but for this example, we’ll choose single. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gcso5y"&gt;After choosing single on Rarible, you’ll end up on the NFT creation screen. The first thing to do is upload the digital file you’re hoping to sell as an NFT, using the Choose File button. Eventually, it’ll end up on &lt;a href="https://ipfs.io/#why"&gt;the InterPlanetary File System&lt;/a&gt;, or IPFS, which is a decentralized way to store media, making it so that your NFT won’t disappear off the internet if one company decides to stop hosting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugmQss"&gt;Like OpenSea, Rarible may ask you for a separate preview image for certain types of media, like videos or music — think of this as a video thumbnail or album art, which will display whenever your NFT shows up on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7YT6us33UkNq_LlDScpdx8Mm-G8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067542/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.48.41.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rarible gives you a few options for how you’ll sell your NFT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YjB10M"&gt;Next, you’ll want to set your selling options. If you don’t want to sell your NFT just yet, you can flip off the “Put on marketplace” switch, which is on by default. If you do want to sell your NFT, though, you’ll have options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LNHdiz"&gt;“Fixed price” is like creating a store listing — you set a price for your NFT, and if someone wants to pay that price, they can just buy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="brazxJ"&gt;“Open for bids” lets people submit offers to buy your NFT, which you can either accept or reject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WnrI4m"&gt;“Timed auction” is an auction — you can set a minimum price and choose when the auction will start and how long it will last. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jBvx3z"&gt;For this example, we’ll go with listing our NFT for a fixed price, which we can enter into the field. You can also choose which currency you’d like to receive (people can, however, send offers in different currencies). When you’re setting your price, remember that Rarible will take 2.5 percent if your NFT sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUPeOr"&gt;After you choose your selling method and details, you’ll have the option to add unlockable content, which will be provided to the buyer. This could be something like an invite link to a private Discord, a code to redeem something on an external website, or even just a message thanking them for buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrfC5k"&gt;The next two options let you use choose your collection (we’ll go with Rarible Singles for our example), and the Free Minting option, which lets you choose whether you want to use Rarible’s lazy minting system, which we went over in Step 3. If you turn it off and are using the Ethereum blockchain, you’ll have to pay a gas fee to mint your NFT at the end of this process — when I was testing, the fee was around $120.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFN_zK5W8UTOmQL4yeqcJFRrAAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067546/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.49.15.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name and description will be important to help you stand out. Most people will want to leave the free minting option on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8m3aJs"&gt;You then give your NFT a name — or title — and a description if you want. Finally, you can choose the royalty percentage. This will change how much of each subsequent sale goes back to you in the future. For example, if someone purchases your NFT for 0.2 ETH and then sells it for 1 ETH in the future, you’ll get a percentage of that sale as well — by default, it’s 10 percent (so 0.1 ETH in our example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lY4abx"&gt;The last option is the Advanced Settings, which lets you add properties to your NFT (which is completely optional but could be useful if you were creating a series of characters with different properties) and alternative description text, which will help make your NFT more accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLlSsB"&gt;Double-check that everything is exactly how you want it, as it could be expensive or impossible to change later. Then, when you’re sure your NFT is good to go, click the “Create Item” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36O0g4K7iFD6MwFxExzJm_Ic14M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067549/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.58.25.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your wallet, in this case MetaMask, will ask you to sign a few transactions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FxJ4xv"&gt;Doing this will kick off a series of actions, during which you’ll have to approve some transactions with your wallet. If you’re using a browser extension, you should get a pop-up when Rarible asks for your signature (if not, you can click on the extension’s icon in your browser, and it should present you with any requests). If you’re using an app, you’ll want to open it on your phone, where you’ll be presented with the request.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_W9_a31bC-lrJN_UIyFgiJQ3cs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067551/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_09.58.31.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your NFT has been created!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4gZe4u"&gt;After approving a few wallet requests and a moment of waiting, you’ll get a message saying that your NFT has been created. You can click the “View NFT” button to see it, and you can see your collection by going to your profile picture in the top right and clicking “My Profile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1ZfUX"&gt;If everything’s gone well, you’ll now have an NFT listed for sale on either Rarible, OpenSea, or both. However, as sellers have told me, that’s not likely to get you very far — as you’ve seen, the process is relatively complicated, but the gold rush-esque environment around NFTs has led many to try their hand at making one. If you want your creation to actually sell, you’ll likely have to find some way to rise above the noise, either through snazzy marketing or making your art absolutely exceptional (and then probably doing some snazzy marketing). That task, however, I’ll leave in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNL0u5"&gt;PS: Don’t worry if your wallet has an NFT section, the NFT you made using this guide doesn’t show up in it. Your wallet reads entries from the blockchain to figure out what it should display, and lazy minted NFTs aren’t actually written to the blockchain until someone buys them — thus, they won’t show up in your wallet after you create them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos announces plans to make its products more efficient and repairable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A group of Sonos wireless speakers, including Arc, Sub, Move and One models taken on September 28, 2020.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLUygZKBxA8ruFWeWvJuzxjGR4E=/0x545:6017x4556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244008/1234776902.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qsCPX"&gt;Sonos announced plans today to make its speakers and other products last longer and use less energy. It’s part of the company’s larger plan to make itself more sustainable, with a focus on minimizing e-waste and the pollution that drives climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pe2VYp"&gt;A big part of Sonos’ new plans is to extend product lifespans by making its devices easier to repair and recycle.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This year, the company started a “Design for Disassembly” program that it wants to guide the development of all of its&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;new speakers starting in 2023. That includes changes like swapping out adhesives for fasteners, which can make it easier for consumers to take apart Sonos products for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wsxBFy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Minimizing e-waste and the pollution that drives climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci4Aev"&gt;There isn’t much information out on this program yet, however. When asked, Sonos did not tell The Verge whether it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will also make replacement parts and repair manuals available — details that will determine how repairable its products are in practice. But the program is intended to “make it easier to repair, refurbish and, eventually, recycle future Sonos products,” Deji Olukotun, Sonos director of policy and corporate social responsibility, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Biwkgk"&gt;The company also plans to start using post-consumer recycled plastic in all of its products by the end of 2023. This might prevent some plastics from winding up in landfills, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226655/microplastics-laundry-wastewater-plastic-pollution-arctic-ocean"&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;animals’ bellies&lt;/a&gt; — but recycling overall has been a pretty &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712435/recycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution"&gt;paltry solution for the world’s plastic pollution problem&lt;/a&gt;. Plastic degrades each time it’s re-hashed, which is why most tech companies have to mix recycled plastics with virgin plastics to make new products. That has some experts worried that a hot market for recycled plastics could actually lead to more demand for new plastics as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zO0aN"&gt;By 2023, Sonos says that all of its products will include “sleep mode,” a feature that cuts down on power consumption while the device is idle. Some companies already have sleep mode on their speakers,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but Sonos just debuted the feature this year on its Roam speaker. The goal is for Sonos products to ultimately use less than 2 watts while idle&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KhedUd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company’s biggest source of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ivCSDh"&gt;By making its speakers more energy-efficient, Sonos is tackling the company’s biggest source of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions. According to Sonos, about 75 percent of the company’s carbon footprint comes from the energy its products’ use over their lifetime. That differs from consumer electronics more broadly, of which &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/greener-electronics-2017/"&gt;up to 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; of CO2 emissions typically come from manufacturing, according to a report by Greenpeace. Between Sonos’ supply chains and consumers’ energy use, Sonos says it was responsible for CO2 emissions equivalent to 267,528 cars driven over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL4tlI"&gt;The company is setting more long-term goals for addressing climate change, too. It wants to cut emissions from its products’ energy use by 45 percent by 2040, and Sonos wants to essentially cancel its entire footprint by that date by relying on a mixture of carbon offsets and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;technologies that remove CO2 &lt;/a&gt;from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nirXcq"&gt;But offsetting climate pollution by paying for forests to naturally soak up carbon dioxide has a &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;checkered track record&lt;/a&gt;. And technologies capable of pulling CO2 out of the air haven’t scaled up to meet the needs of all the companies promising to use them to erase their legacy of pollution. That makes it all the more urgent for Sonos to focus on reducing its environmental footprint in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Betting is the next battleground in sports streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ehCbyvV3b3XxokMmH9z-OW33IE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243843/VRG_ILLO_4892_K_Radtke.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Kristen Radtke&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4EztQ6"&gt;With more cord-cutting options to choose from than ever before, sports fans have a veritable cornucopia of live services from which to pick. And as those services come up with new ways to win over viewers and keep them tuned in, some appear to be coalescing around a big new feature: betting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc3bvr"&gt;Streaming services across the industry have started to add betting features alongside their sports feeds, offering a way to increase engagement and open a new revenue stream in the process. Disney, DAZN, FuboTV, Sling, and others have either launched betting companion features or have expressed an interest in entering the space in the US — and why wouldn’t they? Any savvy sports service would recognize betting has been synonymous with matches for as long as anyone can remember. And there’s plenty of money to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD7J8p"&gt;“Sports fans have been unofficially making bets with their friends and family as they watch the game for decades,” Mike Berkley, chief product officer of FuboTV — which recently launched its own betting app — tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s kind of core to being a fan, making casual bets with friends and family, and it is something that we felt would make our product even more engaging than it is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rWMGKG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Betting is something Disney is “keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VbmmiB"&gt;Look no further than streaming mastermind Disney — a typically family-friendly content purveyor — as evidence that betting could be the next streaming battleground for any company that owns a live sports service. During the company’s most recent earnings call, Disney boss Bob Chapek told shareholders that the company was “moving towards a greater presence in online sports betting” for its ESPN audiences, further stating that betting is something Disney is “keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcaxDU"&gt;“We do believe that sports betting is a very significant opportunity for the company,” Chapek said. “And as we follow the consumer, we necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in a bigger and bigger way. And ESPN is a perfect platform for this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7bHIZ"&gt;(Disney was &lt;a href="https://puck.news/could-disney-spin-off-espn/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Puck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October to be exploring a possible spinoff of ESPN, though a source who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1449078593418678275"&gt;spoke with CNBC&lt;/a&gt; refuted the claim and said the company was focused on building value for ESPN Plus, including by exploring sports betting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJJpXe"&gt;Sports betting has been growing in the last few years on a state-by-state basis. In May 2018, the Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/23501236/supreme-court-strikes-federal-law-prohibiting-sports-gambling"&gt;threw out&lt;/a&gt; a federal law that barred sports gambling, paving the way for individual states to permit it. (New Jersey, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/nyregion/sports-betting-legalized-nj.html"&gt;legalized sports betting&lt;/a&gt; almost immediately.) Today, some 34 percent of sports fans bet weekly on games in the US, according to data firm Ampere Analysis, and spend an average of $51 a week. Sports enthusiasts are also spending around 3.2 hours a week on fantasy gaming, the firm’s data shows. That spells a pretty big opportunity for live sports services hoping to keep their users engaged, differentiate their products, and expand their business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwxMSj"&gt;“The projection is that [legalization of betting] is going to continue to grow state by state aggressively over the next couple of years,” Berkley says. “There’s definitely a trend for this becoming not just legal but more mainstream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUxvbZ"&gt;Disney is hardly the only company exploring the betting avenue. Dish partnered with DraftKings &lt;a href="https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2021/03/dish-and-draftkings-introduce-first-of-its-kind-app-integration/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; to bake DraftKings’ Sportsbook and fantasy contests into its Dish TV Hopper platform as an app integration. (Dish-owned live TV service Sling supports an integrated DraftKings experience for betting, too, as well as dedicated &lt;a href="https://news.sling.com/2021-04-22-SLING-TV-launches-new-exclusive-DraftKings-sports-betting-information-channel"&gt;betting information channels&lt;/a&gt;.) FuboTV launched its own proprietary sportsbook feature for betting in Iowa last month, and it’s currently in the process of clearing regulatory hurdles to operate in other states. NBC Sports and Peacock &lt;a href="https://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2021/09/10/pointsbet-and-nbc-sports-debut-exclusive-betting-integrations-into-football-night-in-america-and-peacock-sunday-night-football-final-post-game-show/"&gt;partner with PointsBet&lt;/a&gt; for their betting integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NBsn7m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_1kX9PoluI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvoH63"&gt;Sports streaming service DAZN, meanwhile, plans “to be in the betting market directly where we can,” &lt;a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/dazn-chairman-kevin-mayer-nft-betting-bt-sport/"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; its chairman Kevin Mayer. DAZN spokesperson Graham James tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that with respect to its US betting strategy, DAZN has “no specific plans to share at this time but believe that the addition of recreational betting to the DAZN platform across all our markets will create a safe, fun, and immersive experience for fans to enjoy alongside the top-tier sports they love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W3YBc"&gt;“The fact that ESPN, DAZN, all these people are talking about it so publicly, it does make me think that they think it’s too big of an opportunity to let them pass by,” Ampere principal analyst Minal Modha tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VElgJx"&gt;While sports betting has traditionally been viewed as taboo in some circles, these companies are betting that the public’s view has changed in recent years. Chapek himself acknowledged that the move might have once been risky for a squeaky-clean brand image like Disney. But now, he says, betting would actually &lt;em&gt;strengthen&lt;/em&gt; its sports arm, particularly among younger audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAea1u"&gt;“Gambling does not have the cachet now that it had, say, 10 or 20 years ago,” Chapek said last month. “It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN, when you have a betting component, and it has no impact on the Disney brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlSUdA"&gt;Betting can work in one of several ways. Dish supports betting through a DraftKings integration on its Hopper devices, letting users scan a QR code to jump to DraftKings’ platform. Sling, meanwhile, uses a text-based redirect system that can be initiated from a menu icon within its experience. Fubo’s betting feature works with its own proprietary sportsbook &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_1kX9PoluI"&gt;app integration&lt;/a&gt; that syncs with whatever’s happening on your TV screen (though it’s still a two-screen experience, with the event happening on your TV and the betting happening through the app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nr9gZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The product will have to continuously evolve to make sure that those audiences stay engaged.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKvJXF"&gt;At present, Chapek says Disney plans to work with third parties on its betting offering. That makes a lot of sense for any company that wants to avoid investments of hundreds of millions of dollars to reach a level of scale akin to DraftKings as a betting operator, Jeff Ifrah, founding member of Ifrah PLLC, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, these streamers can opt to partner with third parties to make money through affiliate gaming revenue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHatO"&gt;“The question to a company like Disney or other streaming companies is going to be: Is that really the best way for us to monetize?” Ifrah says. “There are a ton of practical questions as to what’s the best way to monetize this opportunity. It may not be to be an operator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbdSsw"&gt;There are plenty of sportsbook apps currently available: DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM are just three among many. But sports betting through these platforms isn’t available in all 50 states. For example, DraftKings’ mobile and online betting system is supported in 16 states at present. Importantly, Ifrah points out that any company hoping to clear the regulatory hurdles to operate a proprietary betting platform will have to do so state by state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsCARP"&gt;For a company like FuboTV, that means scaling the product is going to be a slow-moving process — and an expensive one. Currently, its sportsbook app is only available in Iowa, but Berkley tells me FuboTV has market access in four other states, meaning it has obtained licenses to operate in those states but still has to complete the regulatory approval process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="170hfo"&gt;But in a sea of services that are all more or less offering the same thing (less if you’re looking for regional coverage, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;whole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/hulu-drops-sinclair-fox-regional-sports-networks-1234813232/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/masn-and-nbc-regional-sports-networks-removed-from-dish-tv-sling-tv-301260520.html"&gt;mess&lt;/a&gt; entirely), Modha says betting could be a point of differentiation that may help a sports streamer to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSv5oA"&gt;“I think so many of the streaming services will be thinking about, ‘How do we hit that [unique selling point]? How can we ensure that as more and more streaming services are available and the market becomes more fragmented and people are having to spend more and more money, how do we make sure we’re not one of the disposable ones?’ And that’s why something like the gamification of betting comes into it,” Modha says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wkg5xy"&gt;If and when sports betting does become more commonplace across streaming services, it’ll offer streaming companies yet another distinguishing feature that could potentially allow their sports services to succeed. It’s a gamble much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"&gt;Netflix’s gaming push&lt;/a&gt; — the more points of engagement, the better. But as with any streaming draw, the success of these betting implementations will largely depend on whether they can stick out in a crowd of similar or existing offerings, particularly up against goliaths like Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekQLDO"&gt;“There are so many different services in the US. So in the initial stages, all of this will be all shiny and new, and it will attract audiences,” Modha says. “But that will be an evolution — the product will have to continuously evolve to make sure that those audiences stay engaged and make sure that you stay ahead of the curve of where everybody else is.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s top three posts of 2021 were all from WallStreetBets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVtR_SdeHZ1u6cT3csxJMt2L-68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243657/acastro_210128_1777_stonks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stonks go brr.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZJKIp"&gt;Reddit is taking a look back at some of the site’s biggest moments and trends from 2021, and perhaps unsurprisingly, posts from r/wallstreetbets were the most upvoted posts of the year. r/wallstreetbets became hugely popular after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop’s stock price skyrocketed in January&lt;/a&gt; and as people followed updates from Keith Gill&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(aka DeepFuckingValue / Roaring Kitty),&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the trader who invested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256582/roaringkitty-deepfuckingvalue-keith-gill-profile-gamestop-wallstreetbets-wsj"&gt;heavily in GameStop ahead of the stock’s surge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaWDyW"&gt;Here are the top five most upvoted posts, according to Reddit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6ZD8IL"&gt;On r/wallstreetbets, a user bought a billboard in Times Square reading &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?context=3"&gt;“$GME GO BRRR”&lt;/a&gt; and got more than 433K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eJrFj6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6wu59/upvote_so_everyone_sees_we_got_support/"&gt;A screenshotted tweet&lt;/a&gt; on r/wallstreetbets alleging Robinhood hid popular meme stocks and encouraging users to “take all the cash you can afford to lose and buy buy buy” had more than 323K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rhugl5"&gt;One r/wallstreetbets &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme_yolo_update_jan_28_2021/"&gt;update from Gill&lt;/a&gt; showing his GameStop shares losing more $14 million in one day earned more than 287K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SzNuXM"&gt;A post on r/antiwork where a user posted a screenshot &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/q82vqk/quit_my_job_last_night_it_was_nice_to_be_home_to/"&gt;telling their boss they were quitting&lt;/a&gt; got more than 273K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GkVmHi"&gt;A video on r/nextfuckinglevel of a man &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/n1s9ub/dodging_a_cashintransit_robbery_the_man_has_balls/?context=3"&gt;dodging a cash-in-transit robbery&lt;/a&gt; had more than 259K upvotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="moeC1Y"&gt;Posts overall on Reddit were up, according to the company. There were more than 366 million posts (up 19 percent year over year), 2.3 billion comments (up 12 percent year over year), and “nearly” 46 billion upvotes (up 1 percent year over year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSLBzc"&gt;Reddit isn’t just sharing some of its own biggest trends, though: the company is also launching Spotify Wrapped-style personalized recaps showing things like a summary of how much time you’ve spent on the platform. These will be available starting Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHcJSnl6bOeL12PHD2nbnOTJqOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071368/Recap_Media_Graphic_2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an example of what the personalized Reddit Recaps look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VYEIdm"&gt;Part of the fun of Spotify Wrapped is sharing your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;embarrassing music habits on social media&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like Reddit is hoping for a similar reaction with personalized Reddit Recaps. Reddit will also let you hide your username and avatar in your recap if you want to share your insights but don’t want others to know anything else about your account. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Crossing the border, refugees scramble for a working SIM card</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘When there was no internet, I was left with nothing’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="w2J9Kz"&gt;Ana* and her three-year-old son arrived at the shelter for migrant and refugee women in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey in early October. Every morning, the 14 women at the shelter — mainly from El Salvador and Honduras — share the house chores: sweeping, cooking, and babysitting the children of their compañeras working informal jobs to save enough money to cross into the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umbU4a"&gt;The majority of them, traveling alone with as many as three children, spent days unable to communicate with their families after crossing Mexico’s southern border. Not having a local SIM card, they said, made the uncertainty and anxiety of their journey that much worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujacJk"&gt;For a family crossing the border, a working phone is critical. It lets asylum-seekers stay connected to family, receive money, and access critical information for their journey. But refugees and asylum-seekers face enormous challenges keeping those phones working, as the logistics of cellular networks work against them. The result is a constant scramble, as refugees swap SIM cards and wrestle with telecoms in an effort to create a safer migration journey for themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DVuoPr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My family hadn’t heard from me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkAHsf"&gt;Ana lost contact with her family after crossing the Guatemala-Mexico border. She didn’t know how to change a SIM card and couldn’t find a place to charge her phone, which ran out of battery in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osED5c"&gt;“My family hadn’t heard from me. Once at the shelter, I went out and found a little shop where I had to pay 15 pesos per hour to charge it and bought a chip for 80 pesos. Then, I called my family,” explains Ana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIlhJ"&gt;Losing mobile coverage when entering Mexico deprives people in transit from being monitored and accompanied by their support network. While telecommunication infrastructure has expanded across borders with expensive international roaming plans, people trying to move freely across those same borders are being left with limited access to mobile services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZMvRv"&gt;Vladimir Cortés is the digital rights program officer in the Mexico and Central America office of Article 19, a nonprofit focused on freedom of expression. Cortés explains that governments, multinational telecommunication corporations, regulatory bodies, and international organizations could establish continuity of access to mobile services for people in migration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uWu8ks"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When there was no internet, I was left with nothing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7bGMTu"&gt;“International organizations can articulate these different actors to guarantee mobile network coverage,” says Cortés. “There is an important opportunity to recognize the phenomenon that currently exists and the level of protection that states can guarantee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRpQUy"&gt;Six months ago, Ana and her son left their home in Choluteca, Honduras, after receiving threats from the people who kidnapped and killed her 14-year-old daughter Gabriela*. Throughout the journey, Ana, who aspires to build a safe life with her son in Los Angeles, relied on Google Maps to check her location, and WhatsApp or Facebook to communicate with her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEnffF"&gt;“In some parts there was a signal and in others not. When there was no internet, I was left with nothing,” says 37-year-old Ana, while her son watches &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;SquarePants&lt;/em&gt; on her Samsung Galaxy S6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9vUF1"&gt;The use of GPS applications and instant messaging apps — mostly Facebook and WhatsApp — allows refugees to orient themselves and participate in online migrant networks that can give them a greater sense of community and security. Some of the women at the shelter said it’s hard to trust information available online, since they are aware of online scams that falsely promise visa facilitation and transportation assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xPoEJM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I just want to know how my father and brothers are”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5kGeU"&gt;Some of these online scams have been linked to serious criminal activities such as kidnapping and human trafficking. Diana González and Juan Manuel Casanueva, researchers at &lt;a href="https://socialtic.org/"&gt;SocialTIC&lt;/a&gt;, a Mexican digital security nonprofit, identified various &lt;a href="https://socialtic.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Etnografia_digital_migracion_covid19.pdf"&gt;connectivity risks&lt;/a&gt; at Mexico’s southern border such as identity theft and extortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upJmb2"&gt;“The dangers are basically associated with two: identity theft for extortion issues, meaning some type of information can be used to contact their families and ask for money,” explains Casanueva. “And the other is not entirely digital … it’s the lack of communication. If they are victims of other types of danger, they cannot communicate with a support network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIJ1m3"&gt;The women at the shelter often verify online information with their compañeras or other offline sources, such as staff at the shelter or migrant rights groups, since they know Facebook is used to spread misinformation and fake news.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fd8K2"&gt;“Saying Facebook is bad or WhatsApp is bad does not apply. It is the only thing there is,” says Casanueva. “The question that should be asked in these spaces is how these people can have the appropriate information, and also how to prevent risks that occur on these platforms, such as identity theft for issues of extortion and scams, criminal networks, and possibly even risk of kidnapping, and lots of fake news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="To4d6h"&gt;Ana limits her mobile use to messaging her family, seeking information about border crossings, and watching cartoons with her son. &lt;em&gt;Masha and the Bear&lt;/em&gt; is her favorite since, she says, “it helps to distract” her mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waocjE"&gt;Mary left El Salvador with her three children, ages two, five, and eight, after being extorted at the pizza place she owned, and like Ana, she doesn’t like to use her Huawei Y7P unless out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPjsYR"&gt;“The truth is, I don’t use the phone much more than the girls use it to watch videos to entertain themselves. I just want to know how my father and brothers are, and if my brother who is in the United States is going to send me money,” says Mary, who withheld her full name for her own protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGIwiG"&gt;For the women in the shelter, the priority is to earn more money so they can find safer ways to cross. When they were able, many took buses instead of walking, or stayed in hotels instead of shelters, to protect their children throughout their journey toward the US-Mexico border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vgB4sh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“She had her father’s number memorized in case her cell phone was taken away.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RBTRTG"&gt;Esther Nohemí Álvarez lent her Huawei phone to her 15-year-old daughter, who was starting to show symptoms of depression. It was 2019, and the Migration Protection Protocol, a Trump era policy also called “Remain in Mexico,” was forcing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/20/20997299/asylum-border-mexico-us-iom-unhcr-usaid-migration-international-humanitarian-aid-matamoros-juarez"&gt;thousands of asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; arriving at the US’s southern border to remain in Mexico to await their US hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OSX5Z"&gt;Álvarez’s daughter grabbed her mom’s phone and did TikTok dance challenges with other girls at the shelter.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That same phone allowed her to stay in contact with her mother in Monterrey and with her father in Virginia, while she crossed the US-Mexico border with the assistance of a smuggler in April of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1DvEP"&gt;“As an unaccompanied minor, immigration detained her and they contacted her father. She had her father’s number memorized in case her cell phone was taken away,” says Álvarez. “She was there for about 25 days, and they allowed her like three calls to contact her dad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQYHlo"&gt;Of all the risks that crossed Álvarez’s mind when she decided to send her daughter alone after her asylum claim was denied, digital risks were the least of her concern, let alone government surveillance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLTcSH"&gt;But earlier this year, Mexico’s Senate passed a law that would require mobile users to register their biometric data in a government database in order to obtain a SIM card. The law will allegedly fight organized crime and reduce extortions and kidnappings, even though a similar project implemented between 2008 and 2011 only saw an increase in extortions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNmA8E"&gt;Digital rights groups challenging the law affirm that users’ sensitive personal information will be at risk. Although the law is currently suspended indefinitely by the Supreme Court, Cortés explains that its implementation would generate a greater violation of the rights of migrants, who already face persecution by the Mexican National Institute of Migration and other state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnFTHP"&gt;“The registration of the card is not the only problem. The other problem is the delivery of biometrics data. Authoritarian countries can use this as a way to control and undermine the privacy of people,” adds Cortés. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUsq01"&gt;The first time Álvarez and her daughter tried to cross through Ciudad Miguel Alemán, across the border from Roma, Texas, they were held for a week in the&lt;em&gt; hieleras&lt;/em&gt;, Customs and Border Protection’s notoriously cold detention cells. They were deported through Nuevo Laredo — a border city that has seen a surge in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-mexico-business-c0d3079172498f625e5e041bb3e8a714"&gt;drug cartel-related violence&lt;/a&gt; — more than 150 kilometers away from their original point of entry. It was her mobile phone that allowed Álvarez to locate herself on a map and seek assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bg2QsI"&gt;As the US government deploys new technologies to surveil and track migrants, asylum-seeking women are not deterred by them. Even if they have to wait longer in Monterrey until they consider it safe to cross, returning home is no longer an option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2xVQjh"&gt;“We are going to cross the border. That’s why I’m working here [in Monterrey] to save money,” says Mary, while two of her kids run around the table. “If we don’t make it, then we are going to stay here because I cannot return to my country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksTQJj"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Some names in this story have been changed to protect sources from possible reprisals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft updates OneDrive for faster syncing on Apple M1 Macs and Windows on Arm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afZG7_FHdvEnPwBlzqnA8H1W3IA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243443/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HrbOf0"&gt;Microsoft has released a OneDrive sync app for Windows on Arm and Apple’s M1 Macs for its cloud-based storage service. The public preview of the updated OneDrive app is &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/onedrive-sync-for-native-arm-devices-now-in-public-preview/ba-p/3031668"&gt;available as an opt-in download&lt;/a&gt; for both Windows on Arm and macOS, and allows the app to run natively on these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoUH4v"&gt;This should improve the performance of the OneDrive sync app, as the OneDrive process will no longer run emulated on Windows on Arm. The jump to 64-bit is also useful for OneDrive users with lots of files or large files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe7McB"&gt;Microsoft’s OneDrive support for Apple’s M1 Macs and Windows on Arm comes after Dropbox revealed it’s testing its own native app. Dropbox is currently supported on Apple’s M1 Macs through Rosetta, but an updated app is arriving next year. “We have an internal build for native Apple M1 support, which we’re currently testing and we’re committed to releasing in the first half of 2022,” says a Dropbox spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/28/dropbox-m1-support/"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRRPoQ"&gt;Microsoft has not committed to a full release date for its OneDrive Arm preview, but anyone can enable it from the “get OneDrive Insider preview updates before release” option in the OneDrive settings &amp;gt; about section.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Snap is sidestepping the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNBejYuq4_yfMsvSq5s0OVgwlLM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243378/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_169a836c_b9ff_4146_bdcb_63815b48f97a_1920x1080.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYBmyA"&gt;More than other recent years, in 2021 the tech industry focused a great deal of its energy on a single question: who will build and own the next generation of the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfNBPq"&gt;In one corner, you have the scrappy upstarts eager to topple the existing world order and rebuild it from scratch on the blockchain. These companies give their effort the aspirational name “Web3.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsMEjY"&gt;In the other corner, you have the existing tech platforms, which envision the next generation of the internet as a slightly more interoperable version of the existing web. What will set it apart is new hardware: augmented reality glasses and virtual reality helmets that will bring us together in a series of linked experiences that occupy an ever-increasing share of our waking hours. Platforms have taken to calling this “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MkQ1U"&gt;Web3 and the metaverse will surely intersect along the way — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he imagines people bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;non-fungible tokens&lt;/a&gt; along with them as they traverse the company’s virtual worlds. But while crypto-based platforms are still mostly in their earliest stages, the battle for the metaverse already has at least a half-dozen established companies investing billions of dollars in realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLZyOY"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one that strangely flies a little under the radar — and is taking a more straightforward path. While other companies are painting grand visions of the metaverse via press interviews and op-eds, Snap has been quietly focused on two of the ideas that can actually bring it into existence: steadily improving its hardware every year or so and attracting developers by giving away that hardware while offering them ways to profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_2mqPHUP-X3S85ET9YSQ68uVp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060781/alopez_211129_4909_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iDmqUv"&gt;The core function of AR glasses is to project images in front of your face, turning your field of vision into a virtual computer screen on which you can receive messages, play games, and interact with digital or real-world objects for educational or commercial purposes. Most platform executives agree that this would be a good, useful thing and that lots of people would buy the hardware that makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4sv3z"&gt;The problem is that the tech isn’t ready: creating high-resolution projections using a device that fits on your face, has good battery life, and costs a reasonable price, is far beyond the ability of today’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Plhsgb"&gt;Surveying the AR landscape this week, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-iphone-successor-comes-into-focus-11638594004"&gt;predicted that someday high-tech glasses will become Apple’s successor to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. It looked at similar efforts from Facebook, Microsoft, and the lesser-known Vuzix, among others. And to Snap, which made the first major set of high-tech glasses when it released Spectacles in 2016, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; devoted just a single sentence: “Snapchat parent Snap earlier this year added AR functions to the latest version of its Spectacles smart-glasses, which are so far available only for developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekHrFP"&gt;Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/snap-hits-its-stride"&gt;when they were announced in May&lt;/a&gt;, Spectacles became the first pair of the company’s glasses I didn’t get to try myself. Instead, the company seeded them with a handful of developers who create AR effects, games, and utilities and gave them a few months to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMG2bw"&gt;And then, one day last week, the company invited me to a rented backyard in San Francisco’s Castro District to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Eg1cFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only the most hardcore futurists would want these today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gt29pb"&gt;Within a few minutes of wearing the glasses, two things became clear to me. One is that these are very much a product for developers rather than consumers. The chonky frames, 30-minute battery, and presumably high price would limit their appeal to all but the most hardcore futurists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYt7IO"&gt;At the same time, my morning with Spectacles was enough to convince me that AR glasses have a promising future and are likely to print money for the companies that manage to perfect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ku2QsJ"&gt;It started with a donut. Sitting around a table with some Snap executives, I was introduced to &lt;a href="http://www.tacolamp.com/"&gt;Brielle Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, a full-time AR creator who is part of the company’s &lt;a href="https://ar.snap.com/ghost"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; program for up-and-coming developers. Garcia has made dozens of AR effects for Snapchat — the company calls them “lenses” — and one such idea came to her while eating at a restaurant during COVID. Like many eateries, this one had begun telling customers to scan codes with their phones to access the menu. Garcia thought it would look better in AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BuasF"&gt;Using Snap’s &lt;a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/"&gt;Lens Studio software&lt;/a&gt;, she mocked up a menu that displays items in three dimensions sitting virtually on your table. When I opened it up using Spectacles, I waved my hands to advance through the virtual goods: a burger, a sushi roll, a piece of pie. The donut looked realistic enough that I developed slight hunger pangs looking at it. Compared to a QR code menu on my phone, Garcia’s AR project was meaningfully better. And I felt that way despite the relatively low resolution of the text, at least compared to what you might see on a current-generation smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUzF3o"&gt;The Snap team had other tricks to show off. In one game, a zombie chased me around the yard. (Alex Heath, who got a similar demo at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"&gt;posted a video of his zombie chase that gives you the idea&lt;/a&gt;.) In another, I hung virtual Christmas lights on the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFw1vpoveC3rzomUOvIuSdRum7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060786/alopez_211129_4909_0015.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge reporter Alex Heath wears the new Spectacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fKzFE9"&gt;The flaws are all readily apparent. The biggest among them is the relatively small field of view that Spectacles can produce using its current technology. When you don the glasses, you might assume that you’ll be able to see a digital overlay that covers everything you see. Instead, it’s a relatively small box at the center of your vision. As a result, I was constantly moving my ahead to attempt to “place” the digital effect back in the box where I could see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kcy7o"&gt;In some cases, as with Garcia’s menu, objects were relatively small and slow-moving, and this was fine. In others, particularly the zombie chase, the field of view was so small that I found the game all but unplayable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D5IGM"&gt;That said, the state of the art is still further along than I expected when I first sat down with the glasses. For my final demo of the day, I used Spectacles to project a toy dinosaur on the table where we were all sitting. It appeared as a perfect hologram, contained neatly within the glasses’ field of view — the sort of thing that would delight any child to whom you showed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtuC6R"&gt;A small thing today but one that points to a big future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEnf5reRxNrtBc5ODWV-bLrCTFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060793/alopez_211129_4909_0022.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iXM5gh"&gt;Snap faces a lot of competition as it works to turn today’s Spectacles into the iPhone of the future. Apple is at work on its own headset, which will combine AR and VR and will &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-31/why-are-apple-aapl-iphone-13-watch-series-7-ipads-taking-so-long-to-arrive-kvfjgjkx?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt;reportedly debut it next year&lt;/a&gt;. Meta is &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/facebook-says-its-developing-fully-ar-glasses/#:~:text=A%20Facebook%20employee%20demonstrates%20a%20prototype%20of%20true%20AR%20glasses.&amp;amp;text=The%20social%20network%20announced%20the,an%20AR%20family%20game%20night."&gt;working to launch AR glasses&lt;/a&gt; next year as well. And &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3653"&gt;Microsoft just signed a deal with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate on a future generation of its HoloLens headset that will presumably be aimed at consumers. (It’s not expected until 2024.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrwviH"&gt;Meanwhile, more software-oriented efforts from Roblox, Epic Games, and Niantic are all afoot — and will likely lead to hardware projects of their own down the road. (Niantic&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/niantic-ceo-shares-teaser-image-of-ar-glasses-device/"&gt; has already commissioned a reference design&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7wfNn"&gt;But one thing about Snap, as co-founder Bobby Murphy told me this week, is that the company has been working on this initiative for many years — predating much of its current competitive set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9rx2V"&gt;“We’ve been incredibly invested and interested in an AR future for many, many years now,” Murphy told me ahead of &lt;a href="https://lensfest.live/"&gt;its LensFest developer event&lt;/a&gt;, which runs through Thursday. “The ability to perceive and render digital experiences directly into the world really aligns to how we as humans naturally operate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfVnMG"&gt;To date, Snap has signed up 250,000 people to create more than 2.5 million AR effects. More than 300 of those people have gotten 1 billion or more views on their Snapchat lenses, the company says. Snapchat lenses are viewed 6 billion times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfTKH7"&gt;Of course, the majority of those are purely for entertainment: making your face look younger, or prettier, or otherwise distorted to send snaps to your friends, or to place a digital dancing hot dog in the environment around you. But Snap has started to layer in other sorts of experiences, like a “scan” feature that lets you use the Snapchat camera to identify trees — or, more importantly, from a revenue perspective — shopping opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ARBh2X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does money grow on AR trees?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ3l9i"&gt;It turns out that all those funny-face lenses trained a generation of users that a screen can itself be a window into real-world experiences, whether on a smartphone or a pair of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VpngF"&gt;“That’s actually been a very helpful starting point for us to start to push into kind of a much wider variety of use cases,” Murphy told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIP0ml"&gt;One thing you won’t catch Murphy doing much is talking about the metaverse. While Snap’s ambitions arguably fit under that umbrella, the company seems confident enough in its existing vision not to adopt the buzzwords of the moment. At the same time, Murphy says the recent acceleration in development around AR is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEBcxW"&gt;“It’s not that there’s been a leap in technology, but I think we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; starting to see a broader emergence of use cases for which AR is maybe escaping the novelty sphere, and actually driving real value for companies and for creators,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yL3H0X"&gt;There’s no reliable timeline for when that next leap will occur — and when hundreds of millions of people will begin wearing their AR glasses in the way many assume they someday will. But using the latest version of Spectacles, I find myself having trouble believing that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; won’t get there eventually — and maybe sooner than a lot of people think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCs8Ps"&gt;“The way that we’re looking at our opportunity in the future, it’s really around developing this kind of singular, holistic platform,” Murphy said. “In which you as an AR creator can make something really compelling, and get that in front of people — through Snapchat, through &lt;a href="https://kit.snapchat.com/camera-kit"&gt;CameraKit&lt;/a&gt;, through Spectacles — and then build a career or build a business through that kind of path.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="R75S9e"&gt;Winning over developers doesn’t guarantee that any particular company will win the mixed-reality future. But no one can win without them, either. For the moment, Snap has more than its share of enthusiastic creators. And together, they just might make the metaverse an actual reality — even if the company never calls it that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bowser agrees to $10 million fine for selling Nintendo Switch hacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLYlLT"&gt;Canadian hacker Gary Bowser has &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-07-nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-agrees-to-pay-usd10m-fine"&gt;agreed to pay $10 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle a Nintendo lawsuit against him over piracy charges. Bowser is a member of the Team Xecuter group that have created mod chips or jailbroken the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, NES Classic Edition, and other consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MlCn2"&gt;Team Xecuter’s most well-known product is a USB device called the SX Pro that allows the Nintendo Switch to run pirated games. Nintendo has been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/18/21262121/nintendo-switch-hacking-lawsuit-pirated-games"&gt;chasing Switch hackers&lt;/a&gt; for years, and Bowser was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499297/team-xecuter-selling-nintendo-hacks-arrested-charged-fraud"&gt;arrested and indicted&lt;/a&gt; last year in a separate federal case. He was ordered to pay $4.5 million for charges related to Nintendo Switch hacks. In total, Bowser is paying Nintendo at least $14.5 million in restitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhD37c"&gt;Bowser made a business out of selling console mods, a controversial decision in a modding and emulation community that typically focuses on open-source efforts that usually avoid federal authorities. Nintendo has a history of aggressively pursuing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18117172/nintendo-youtube-monetization-partner-program-super-smash-bros-ultimate-lets-play-livestream"&gt;unauthorized use&lt;/a&gt; of its intellectual property, and the company has regularly gone after ROM sites that host game files.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo teases retractable rear camera for phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LTrYZpknmIRBlb2ESvWB1D_RGaE=/0x0:1119x746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70243251/Screenshot_2021_12_08_at_16.19.32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjsbeB"&gt;Oppo has released a brief video hinting at a new type of camera design for smartphones. The company’s “self-developed retractable camera” is shown extending from the phone’s body before retracting back inside. The video suggests that the mechanism is waterproof and that it’ll automatically retract the camera if the phone is dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6UIgo"&gt;Unlike pop-up selfie cameras that hide themselves inside a phone until needed, moving the camera back and forth on the Z-axis could have implications for image quality, though Oppo hasn’t yet claimed anything about any optical advantages of this design. It doesn’t appear to be a zoom lens, given it’s marked simply as 50mm, but it could theoretically help improve telephoto performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B6GnXn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most pop-ups are annoying... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not our self-developed retractable camera!   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explore more in INNO WORLD on 14/12.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOINNODAY2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOINNODAY2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/33hgJSw8If"&gt;pic.twitter.com/33hgJSw8If&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468143243183468556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vlj0TN"&gt;The markings on the camera module show that the sensor is 1/1.56 inches and the lens is 50mm-equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture, meaning it should be around 2x longer than the phone’s main lens. That’s a much bigger sensor than you tend to find behind telephoto lenses, so maybe the extra height allowed by the retracting mechanism is what makes this possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TwZRR"&gt;Oppo is releasing this video ahead of next week’s annual Inno Day event, where the company often shows off various concepts and technologies before they’re commercially deployed. Last year’s event featured &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;a rollable phone and AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Oppo is holding Inno Day across two days, December 14th and 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
