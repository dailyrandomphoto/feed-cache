    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons adds Mario-themed items this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Mario items in Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/002hXZLoaiXXTd-UuJhc9SzgWKg=/0x0:1512x1008/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833222/animalcrossing32thanniversarymario.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYCe3O"&gt;In celebration of Mario’s 35th anniversary, Nintendo is adding Mario-themed items to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. New content will be available on February 25th, the developer announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vatJv"&gt;Included in the update are Mario and Luigi’s signature costumes, as well as items like Bowser flags and blocks to make islands feel a little more in tune with the mustachioed plumber. A trailer released alongside the news today features an impressive look at the possibilities, from classic dungeon-themed items to villagers hanging out in costume. The update will be available for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="erMybG"&gt;Nintendo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250249/animal-crossing-new-horizon-nintendo-switch-festivale-update"&gt;teased the update&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, though it’s arriving a little earlier than expected. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;continues to hold in-game events year-round to keep the game fresh. Earlier this week, players got carnival content. The game launched last  March, becoming a cultural phenomenon — in part due to its coincidental timing alongside pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22188452/animal-crossing-new-horizons-coronavirus-pandemic-year-2020"&gt;lockdowns&lt;/a&gt; across the world. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo announces a new Mario Golf for the Switch coming June 25th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9gTc6"&gt;Nintendo is bringing back its &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf&lt;/em&gt; series for the Switch with a new entry, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aucAzFWpvMc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, arriving June 25th. The game is the sixth entry in the series and the first since &lt;em&gt;World Tour &lt;/em&gt;released for the Nintendo 3DS handheld back in 2014. It’s also the first home console &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf &lt;/em&gt;since 2003, Nintendo confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qsh5s"&gt;The game looks like it features your standard Mario sports-themed gameplay, with multiplayer and a variety of modes, including a speed golf mode. Nintendo also revealed a new story mode for &lt;em&gt;Super Rush &lt;/em&gt;and the ability to play as your own customizable Mii. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dbrand’s matte black PS5 side panels are now available for both models</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3a2DmMC2tyQTYt3imVLwjKi65Y4=/0x0:2061x1374/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833132/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_1.56.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dbrand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LTWTvA"&gt;Skin company Dbrand &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1362149455806537729"&gt;is now selling&lt;/a&gt; its blacked-out PlayStation 5 “Darkplates” for the digital edition of the console. The company released the panels for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;disk version of the console last week&lt;/a&gt;, but now they’re available for people who have said goodbye to physical media as well. At time of writing, Dbrand is estimating that the digital edition plates will ship in May, and they cost $60.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqXMV9"&gt;The “Darkplates” are designed to replace the PS5’s standard (and striking, but not necessarily in a good way) white side panels with matte black ones instead. The company is also sticking with its typically aggressive marketing style by replicating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;Sony’s texture patterning&lt;/a&gt;, but with images of Dbrand’s logo instead. If you’re lucky enough to have the console, are looking to make it blend in a bit more, and don’t mind scrolling through some cringe (or cool, depending on your tastes) marketing, you can check out &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;the Darkplates store page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>RetroN Sq is a cube-shaped console for playing Game Boy titles on your TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FSH0T5YGl-mSpw6q7vcJvag0wA=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833124/retron_square.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RetroN Sq comes in two colors: “black gold” and “hyper beach.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Hyperkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z3TvH5"&gt;Hyperkin is best known for making gaming peripherals, but it also creates clones of consoles that allow you to play retro games in modern resolutions. Now it is releasing a new retro console that will allow you to play Game Boy games on your TV. &lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-blackgold-hyperkin/"&gt;Hyperkin's RetroN Sq&lt;/a&gt; (Square) is a console that will allow you to play Game Boy, GBC, and GBA cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNrENT"&gt;The RetroN Square includes one wired USB “Scout” controller with a shape similar to a SNES controller. Instead of composite video hook-ups, the RetroN Sq connects to a TV via HDMI with games upscaled to 720p resolution; there’s also a switch that will allow you to switch the aspect ratio to either 4:3 or 16:9, depending on your preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GztJal"&gt;The console will allow you to natively play Game Boy and GBC cartridges, while GBA games are listed as a “beta feature,” but it does not note which GBA games are compatible. The back of the console includes a memory card slot, allowing you to store firmware for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7Zz8m"&gt;I know the official product name hints it is supposed to be a square-shaped console, yet the design looks more like a color, compact Nintendo GameCube that strictly plays Game Boy cartridges, but I’ll let you be the judge of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gtI8Hk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10348071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QMKbNo"&gt;Hyperkin’s RetroN Sq will release on March 25th for $75. But if you already know you want to buy one, you can preorder your unit at &lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-blackgold-hyperkin/"&gt;Hyperkin’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The gadget comes in two colors: “&lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-blackgold-hyperkin/"&gt;black gold&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://hyperkinlab.com/retron-sq-hd-gaming-console-for-game-boy-game-boy-color-game-boy-advance-hyper-beach-hyperkin/"&gt;hyper beach&lt;/a&gt;,” which to me looks more like a turquoise color. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fall Guys is coming to Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jdj7ujpHg7B5tScVqZwD_Babnx8=/185x0:2204x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833094/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_5.08.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oBYdFr"&gt;Mediatonic’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;goofy&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;colorful hit from last year,&lt;em&gt; Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is launching for Nintendo Switch this summer. The news was announced today during a special Nintendo Direct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkQU9i"&gt;Fall Guys is a battle royale game in which players compete in massive elimination-style party games. Each match lasts only a matter of minutes, and players can choose to watch matches play out. The developer released season 2 last fall, which added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507721/fall-guys-season-2-available-now"&gt;medieval-themed&lt;/a&gt; games into the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OFyhVw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aaIs_tQBMKc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17nihZ"&gt;It was an immediate success following its August release, with more than 7 million downloads on Steam that month. It also became the most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402473/fall-guys-sony-ps-plus-most-downloaded-game-all-time"&gt;downloaded PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; title of all time. It failed to become the biggest game on Twitch that month, but it still clocked in as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452358/fall-guys-among-us-twitch-facebook-gaming"&gt;second most-watched&lt;/a&gt;, beating out &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlWrmw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; is currently available on PC and PlayStation 4. The game is also being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397170/fall-guys-mobile-china-game-developer"&gt;ported to mobile&lt;/a&gt;, but only in China. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola One 5G Ace, Moto G Power, and G Play now available on Google Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-Z96kCQERTTvtOcgcmPWjup87Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833072/ajohnson_210126_4384_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Motorola One 5G Ace is now available for sale through Google’s MVNO. | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F0uwoo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi/more-phones-fi-more-choices-you/"&gt;Google Fi is adding&lt;/a&gt; three new Motorola phones: the One 5G Ace, Moto G Power (2021), and Moto G Play (2021). The devices are &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto"&gt;available for sale&lt;/a&gt; directly through the MVNO with the Ace priced at $279, the Moto G Power for $199, and the Moto G Play for $99. You’ll also find last year’s versions of the Power and Play for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C41Aek"&gt;The One 5G Ace has the highest specs of the three, offering a big 6.7-inch 1080p screen, 5,000mAh battery, a capable Snapdragon 750G chipset, and of course, 5G. Google Fi is selling the less expensive version with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a1IRJX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Motorola One 5G Ace review: a weak hand","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"},{"title":"Motorola Moto G Power (2021) review: power over perks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tjojX5"&gt;The G Power model at Fi is the more expensive variant, and that’s a good thing: it includes 64GB of storage rather than the 32GB offered by the base model, which is just not enough for a modern phone. This year’s G Power includes a 5,000mAh battery that provides multiple days of use on a single charge. The G Play is the budget-friendliest option, but you’ll want to add a microSD card for additional storage, since 32GB is your only choice there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCNXE7"&gt;The One 5G Ace and G Power are two takes on a budget device: the Ace aims to do a little bit of everything, while the G Power goes all-in on battery life. We think the Ace is a fine device if you can live with some of its shortcomings, like a so-so camera. The G Power is tougher to recommend — if excellent battery life is a major priority, then it will get the job done, but ultimately it sacrifices a lot in the name of, well, power.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Smash Bros’ Ultimate’s next characters are from Xenoblade Chronicles 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kfQL_zEkLEQpa5Z5IuQcDL3C1do=/200x0:2282x1388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68833005/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_5.02.02_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTdNPl"&gt;Nintendo has announced that Pyra and Mythra from &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2 &lt;/em&gt;will be joining &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, as part of the news from its Nintendo Direct presentation. Pyra and Mythra are set to release in March, with the company promising more details closer to release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWXfco"&gt;The duo marks the latest additions from the &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade &lt;/em&gt;franchise to join Super Smash Bros., following the addition of Shulk — the protagonist of the original &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; — as part of &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros&lt;/em&gt;. on the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The choice of Pyra and Mythra are in some ways an unconventional one, with Nintendo choosing the two companion characters from &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/em&gt; over the game’s main playable character, &lt;a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Rex"&gt;Rex&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YhdpqJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A new DLC fighter for Super &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmashBrosUltimate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SmashBrosUltimate&lt;/a&gt; has been announced! This fighter will release in March, so stay tuned for more information soon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5yBSEMOyx9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5yBSEMOyx9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1362163801890590722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1Vq5L"&gt;Pyra and Mythra (the two count as a single character that players will be able to freely swap between) constitute the fourth DLC character in &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;’s second Fighters Pass. Previous additions included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21298847/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-arms-character-min-min-release-date"&gt;Min Min from &lt;em&gt;Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21495481/steve-minecraft-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-fighter-pass-vol-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; mascots Steve and Alex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; villain Sephiroth, who was announced in December at The Game Awards. The Fighters Pass costs $29.99 for six characters (the four aforementioned characters that have been announced so far, along with two more fighters that should be announced in the coming months), but you can pay $5.99 for each character individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfyw25"&gt;That’s all in addition to &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;’s first Fighters Pass, which costs $24.99 and includes Joker from &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt; hero, Banjo and Kazooie from &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The King of Fighters&lt;/em&gt;’ Terry Bogard, and Byleth from &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NZXT’s H1 PC case gets recalled after that whole ‘catching on fire’ thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NZXT H1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08RLYnJrO5M_raXkvSZq4riVjoc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832999/nzxth1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This case has been recalled, which is a shame as it looks stunning&lt;/em&gt; | NZXT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gipiLS"&gt;PC case and peripheral maker NZXT has recalled its H1 mini-ITX case due to the possibility of a fire hazard under normal use (via &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nzxt-officially-recalls-h1-case-us-canada"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you used the metal screws included with the $350 case to secure your graphics card or other PCIe device to the riser, there was a chance you’d create sparks, or a fire, if it came into contact with a trace in the printed circuit board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eslzg"&gt;NZXT seemed to know this &lt;a href="https://info.nzxt.com/h1-safety-notice/"&gt;in late 2020&lt;/a&gt; when it opted to send out nylon plastic screw kits for H1 owners (upon request) to use in place of the metal ones. But it didn’t issue a full recall at that point, instead opting to resume selling the case. It &lt;a href="https://blog.nzxt.com/details-on-h1-case-safety-issue/"&gt;initially stated&lt;/a&gt; that the issue affected “fewer than ten H1 cases,” but more recently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIs72whgZI9w6d6FhwGGHA"&gt;YouTube channel Gamers Nexus&lt;/a&gt; argued that the nylon screws don’t solve the root problem. If owners ever switched to using a metal screw in the rise, they’d reintroduce the possibility of a fire. It could also spell trouble for people who use metal screws and aren’t aware of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Wp3FS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9XIKOSrQdQ0?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1261&amp;amp;start=1261" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JatXuK"&gt;Gamers Nexus helped to further expose this hazard in a series of videos (here’s parts &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XIKOSrQdQ0&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUscSRLwks&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnDWxiFvUtE&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;), showing its work along the way, which essentially proved the design to be flawed — and dangerous. According to its research (and confirmed by NZXT &lt;a href="https://blog.nzxt.com/a-message-from-our-ceo-johnny-regarding-the-h1-safety-issue/"&gt;in the FAQ section of this post&lt;/a&gt;), the screw’s thread can brush up against the trace in the circuitry as it’s twisted into place. Gamers Nexus worked with NZXT and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a government agency, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/NZXT-Recalls-H1-Computer-Cases-Due-to-Fire-Hazard"&gt;which issued a Fast Track recall of the PC case on February 12th&lt;/a&gt;. CPSC says you should stop using the recalled case, a situation which isn’t convenient ever — especially during a pandemic when it’s tougher to get a different case quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CwUK4H"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QtCqXM"&gt;The recall affects 32,000 cases sold in the US, along with about 1,024 sold in Canada. The CPSC notes that the recall involves “cases with model numbers CA-H16WR-W1 (matte white) and CA-H16WR-B1 (matte black) and serial numbers 1200233400001 to 1203962204202, 00648999610844189725 to 00648999610844206361, and 0120AC00100001 to 01211C01900285.” You can find that info on the bottom of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FP4pkT"&gt;As noted on the CPSC site, if you’re affected, you can call NZXT toll-free at 888-965-5520 from 11AM to 9PM ET (8AM to 6PM PT) Monday through Friday, or contact the company by email at &lt;a href="mailto:h1support@nzxt.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h1support@nzxt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;online at &lt;a href="https://info.nzxt.com/h1-recall/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://info.nzxt.com/h1-recall/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzxt.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F17%2F22287950%2Fnzxt-h1-pc-mini-itx-case-recall-cpsc-gamers-nexus-nylon-metal-fire-hazard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.nzxt.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and click on “Contact” then “Customer Support” for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC A-List subscribers can now wait until July to reactivate due to lack of new Hollywood releases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Entertainment &amp;amp;amp; Tourism Industries In New York City Struggle Under Pandemic Restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zK_6MVqt5A1GTiylpo_-X7RlX9Y=/0x117:5187x3575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832903/1292873510.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYopNh"&gt;AMC Theatres has announced another extension for subscribers of its Stubs A-List membership who are mulling over when to reactivate. Now, existing members of the MoviePass-style plan can wait until July to decide whether they’d like their plan to resume or whether they’ll cancel instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BNwNh"&gt;Previously, AMC said in November it would give subscribers a deadline of March 1st to reactivate or cancel their membership. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, AMC Theatres has allowed its A-List members to keep their plans but pause payments due to widespread theater closures and a severely constricted pipeline of new Hollywood releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6QDrc"&gt;AMC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17482918/amc-subscription-moviepass-stubs-a-list"&gt;launched A-List in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, following MoviePass’ meteoric rise and prior to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer"&gt;disastrous crash&lt;/a&gt;. The service, an extension of the AMC Stubs rewards program that lets customers pay around $20 per month (although more in markets like California and New York) to see three movies per week, quickly became a huge boon to AMC’s business, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/05/amc-stubbs-a-list-800000-moviepass-members-number-1-subscription-movie-ticket-1202619105/"&gt;amassing 800,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in its first year. Yet A-List, like the theater business at large, has been hit hard by COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KxXFmh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMC is hoping summer 2021 will help Hollywood and the theater industry turn the corner&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mSJAf2"&gt;It looks like AMC is now signaling that the new release schedule won’t be improving at the very least until this summer. The company would likely much rather keep people signed up with the prospect of becoming paying customers again in the future rather than risk letting a once-paying subscriber cancel altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ay6bLk"&gt;“We understand that it still may be less than ideal to reactivate your membership at this time. Since there is not a steady stream of new releases, we have once again extended the pause on your A‑List account for four additional months, until July 1, 2021,” AMC wrote in an email to existing A-List subscribers. “We anticipate a robust movie calendar by summer, so all A‑List memberships that remain in a paused state are planned to be automatically reactivated on July 1, 2021.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNR1wV"&gt;With vaccinations on the rise and various states in the US slowly reopening, there is a strong possibility that AMC’s prediction of a robust summer theater schedule pans out and brings in waves of new attendance. And &lt;em&gt;Collider&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://collider.com/upcoming-movies-2021-release-dates/"&gt;up-to-date 2021 release calendar&lt;/a&gt; does show some promising midyear releases on the horizon, like Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(May 7th) and &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick &lt;/em&gt;(July 2nd). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlaeEK"&gt;However, some of the most high-profile releases of last year that were delayed due to COVID-19 are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;not scheduled until the second half of 2021&lt;/a&gt;, including Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; adaptation (October 1st), the newest Bond entry &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die &lt;/em&gt;(October 18th), and &lt;em&gt;Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt; (December 22nd). There’s also no telling whether the pace of COVID-19 vaccination will make it largely safe to resume indoor activities come this May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gUyRn"&gt;AMC last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248335/amc-bankruptcy-debt-movies-delay-streaming"&gt;staved off bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; by raising nearly $1 billion in new funding since December of last year, just shortly before the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;shares received a temporary boost&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the hordes of Reddit retail investors promoting GameStop and similar stocks. That means AMC should be on more solid ground until at least the summer months, when the company expects Hollywood releases and theater attendance to turn the corner. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is ordering way more kids’ content to compete with Netflix and Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Dk3bxBN5Zgv9pwTknC3Z-WH-_M=/195x0:1317x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68832726/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_3.46.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eqJEaI"&gt;With orders for new shows, specials, and movies from some of Cartoon Network’s biggest franchises — including &lt;em&gt;Ben 10&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Teen Titans Go!&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Amazing World of Gumball — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxisOrderingWayMoreKidsContent02172021&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; is leaning hard into kids’ and family content in an effort to compete with top players like Netflix and &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxisOrderingWayMoreKidsContent02172021&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2prJF"&gt;At the center of WarnerMedia’s plans to make HBO Max a must-have streaming service for families in the way that Disney Plus and Netflix have is “unveiling” Cartoon Network as the core family brand at WarnerMedia. The &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/ca/media-release/hbo-max/warnermedia-expands-kids-family-offerings-cartoon-network-and-hbo-max-under-new"&gt;new series and specials ordered&lt;/a&gt; for HBO Max will join a library of shows and movies that make up 3,000 hours of content. Branding is important — and hard — but it’s what works for a studio like Disney. Disney Plus is built around its biggest franchises, including Pixar, which makes it an easy sell for families. By leaning into Cartoon Network, which already has a dedicated hub on HBO Max’s homepage, and producing more content, WarnerMedia is likely hoping that some families will spend more time on HBO Max instead of Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBWY2r"&gt;Kids’ content is a hot commodity, and it’s not difficult to see why. A Morning Consult &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/08/20/youtube-netflix-and-gaming-a-look-at-what-kids-are-doing-with-their-increased-screen-time/"&gt;study from August 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that YouTube and Netflix ranked as the top two platforms on which kids aged five to 12 spend time. Roughly 65 percent of kids pick YouTube as their go-to entertainment source, while 55 percent pick Netflix. At the same time, cable networks like Nickelodeon are losing large swaths of their audience — seeing a drop of nearly 50 percent of its viewership between 2015 and 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnchmielewski/2020/02/24/viacomcbs-has-lost-its-children-nickelodeon-is-looking-for-them-on-youtube/?sh=256e156b7a70"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; While viewership on cable is down, the time kids spend on screens is way, way up. They’re just getting it directly from streaming platforms and apps like YouTube or TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dI6b1U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WarnerMedia is likely hoping that some families will spend more time on HBO Max instead of Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfT1VL"&gt;Another study found that about &lt;a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/355322/78-of-us-households-now-have-one-leading-svod-s.html"&gt;55 percent of households&lt;/a&gt; are interested in having two subscription-based streaming services (think two premium subscription services like Netflix and HBO Max). If companies are trying to figure out how to scale their streaming platforms, and then keeping said subscribers, giving families everything they need in one place is crucial. Streaming platforms have to be something for everyone when everyone is looking for something. That’s especially true right now when people are stuck at home looking to keep themselves and their family members entertained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qH8bzz"&gt;For HBO Max, a platform that is most associated with adult-oriented TV shows and films, it’s tougher to get the “family” message across. AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey told a virtual audience &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/john-stankey-att-warnermedia-restructuring-hbo-max-1234809499/"&gt;during a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; conference&lt;/a&gt; that part of HBO and HBO Max content head Casey Bloys’ new job was figuring out a way to allocate content spending, which will “hit that entire breadth of the family.” While HBO orders teen-centric shows, like &lt;em&gt;Euphoria &lt;/em&gt;and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Generation&lt;/em&gt;, Cartoon Network (and shows like &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;) will likely have a bigger presence on HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEFxDa"&gt;WarnerMedia isn’t the only company trying to figure it out, either. Today, Apple announced a multiyear deal with Skydance Animation, which will include feature films and shows targeted at families. YouTube announced that its YouTube Kids app has more than 35 million weekly viewers, and it’s giving parents more customization power to let kids watch even more within the app. Netflix has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287965/tim-burton-live-action-addams-family-spinoff-wednesday-for-netflix"&gt;Wednesday Addams series from Tim Burton&lt;/a&gt; that will likely find a tween and teen audience. Finally, next week ViacomCBS will unveil its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, including talking about how Nickelodeon and family content fits into the company’s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vtgXgj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For HBO Max, a platform that is most associated with adult-oriented TV shows and films, it’s tougher to get the “family” message across&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGmxzQ"&gt;WarnerMedia has the right tools to be a leader in the kids’ and family space, too. Cartoon Network is a treasure trove of IP. Add in &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Looney Toons&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and streaming rights to the Studio Ghibli collection in the United States, and there’s a lot for kids and families to watch. That’s on top of Warner Bros. films, HBO shows, and more. The only issue WarnerMedia still faces with HBO Max is getting that message out. Again, families know what they’re getting with Netflix and Disney Plus — what they get with HBO Max isn’t always as obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
