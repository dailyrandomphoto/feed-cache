    <title>Twitter Spaces adds co-host option to help moderate and manage rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x9uhxQryTqKJsFjeq-nkLLA3ygw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685280/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0setuD"&gt;Twitter is updating Spaces to allow hosts to designate up to two co-hosts for its social audio rooms, making it easier for hosts of the audio space to help manage and moderate conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPFJYU"&gt;Once invited, co-hosts have almost all the same moderation and managing privileges as the main host: they can speak, invite other members of the room to speak, pin tweets, boot people from the room, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNcz6-sZ6nYhowVSilBqbw2RNCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764381/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_3.42.05_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7pxy5WaCKZahGvcmRijivoirWCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764380/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_3.42.41_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RLqIA1"&gt;There are a few limitations, though: only the main host can invite or remove other users as co-hosts — one co-host can’t invite a second one, for example. Co-hosts also can’t end the room; only the original host can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGLPXv"&gt;The co-host feature also expands the number of participants that can talk at once in a Space: now you can have one host, two co-hosts, and ten speakers all active in a room at once, up from the previous ten-speaker limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OLR0XO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;making it easier to manage your Space…introducing co-hosting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- hosts have two co-host invites they can send&lt;br&gt;- the table just got bigger: 1 host, 2 co-hosts, and 10 speakers&lt;br&gt;- co-hosts can help invite speakers, manage requests, remove participants, pin Tweets and more! &lt;a href="https://t.co/s76JFbhTL2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s76JFbhTL2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1423333566675628039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAkUvr"&gt;The new addition is rolling out now and should be a useful part in helping hosts keep Spaces under control, especially for larger conversations. The fast-paced rollout also shows how important Twitter views Spaces to be: the company also recently dedicated the top area of users’ timelines in the app (where Fleets used to live) to the social audio feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reveals new efforts to fight child abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gok31hxdir1iv9lGvMHre9icNaQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685176/acastro_180130_1777_0005_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ijVtvE"&gt;In a briefing on Thursday afternoon, Apple confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;previously reported plans&lt;/a&gt; to deploy new technology within iOS, macOS, watchOS, and iMessage that will detect potential child abuse imagery, but clarified crucial details from the ongoing project. For devices in the US, new versions of iOS and iPadOS rolling out this fall have “new applications of cryptography to help limit the spread of CSAM [child sexual abuse material] online, while designing for user privacy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVAAte"&gt;The project is also detailed in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;a new “Child Safety” page on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The most invasive and potentially controversial implementation is the system that performs on-device scanning before an image is backed up in iCloud. From the description, scanning does not occur until a file is getting backed up to iCloud, and Apple only receives data about a match if the cryptographic vouchers (uploaded to iCloud along with the image) for a particular account meet a threshold of matching known CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s7c9Mt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple described several restrictions that are included to protect privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MWQ3zI"&gt;For years, Apple has used hash systems to scan for child abuse imagery sent over email, in line with similar systems at Gmail and other cloud email providers. The program announced today will apply the same scans to user images stored in iCloud Photos, even if the images are never sent to another user or otherwise shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVFdM5"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; provided along with the briefing, Apple justified its moves for image scanning by describing several restrictions that are included to protect privacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SWQhU3"&gt;Apple does not learn anything about images that do not match the known CSAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnepX8"&gt;database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyjJWd"&gt;Apple can’t access metadata or visual derivatives for matched CSAM images until a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFPm9k"&gt;threshold of matches is exceeded for an iCloud Photos account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hlnFE"&gt;The risk of the system incorrectly flagging an account is extremely low. In addition,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWYbmK"&gt;Apple manually reviews all reports made to NCMEC to ensure reporting accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7XIpC"&gt;Users can’t access or view the database of known CSAM images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNtzsj"&gt;Users can’t identify which images were flagged as CSAM by the system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xsxTtI"&gt;The new details build on concerns leaked earlier this week, but also add a number of safeguards that should guard against the privacy risks of such a system. In particular, the threshold system ensures that lone errors will not generate alerts, allowing apple to target an error rate of one false alert per trillion users per year. The hashing system is also limited to material flagged by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and images uploaded to iCloud Photos. Once an alert is generated, it is reviewed by Apple and NCMEC before alerting law enforcement, providing an additional safeguard against the system being used to detect non-CSAM content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5RQd2"&gt;Apple commissioned technical assessments of the system from three independent cryptographers (&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_Benny_Pinkas.pdf"&gt;PDFs 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_David_Forsyth.pdf"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_Mihir_Bellare.pdf"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), who found it to be mathematically robust. “In my judgement this system will likely significantly increase the likelihood that people who own or traffic in such pictures (harmful users) are found; this should help protect children,” said professor David Forsyth, chair of computer science at University of Illinois, in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_David_Forsyth.pdf"&gt;one of the assessments&lt;/a&gt;. “The accuracy of the matching system, combined with the threshold, makes it very unlikely that pictures that are not known CSAM pictures will be revealed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNvsmU"&gt;However, Apple said other child safety groups were likely to be added as hash sources as the program expands, and the company did not commit to making the list of partners publicly available going forward. That is likely to heighten anxieties about how the system might be exploited by the Chinese government, which has long sought greater access to iPhone user data within the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVILkJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample Messages warning for children and parents when sexually explicit photos are detected" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YMgiqX4ORjTh6vSUvHOAFrLTHr8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764418/child_safety__evd7tla79kqe_large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample Messages warning for children and parents when sexually explicit photos are detected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="erd5tl"&gt;Alongside the new measures in iCloud Photos, Apple added two additional systems to protect young iPhone owners at risk of child abuse. The Messages app already did on-device scanning of image attachments for children’s accounts to detect content that’s potentially sexually explicit. Once detected, the content is blurred and a warning appears. A new setting that parents can enable on their family iCloud accounts will trigger a message telling the child that if they view (incoming) or send (outgoing) the detected image, their parents will get a message about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obkAvI"&gt;Apple is also updating how Siri and the Search app respond to queries about child abuse imagery. Under the new system, the apps “will explain to users that interest in this topic is harmful and problematic, and provide resources from partners to get help with this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram scammers figured out a way to get paid for banning people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e2MnHWMIInM1YAQHJy8l5SoSQg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684779/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a24fCm"&gt;Instagram scammers have developed a lucrative “banning” racket, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k78kmv/instagram-ban-restore-service-scam"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For around $60, some scammers will get banned whatever Instagram account you choose, friend or foe, and often the scammers make even more money on the backend by helping the targeted users regain access to their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4g5PZ"&gt;The process, according to interviews and material reviewed by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, involves using a verified account to impersonate a target (their name, photo, bio), and then reporting the target as an impersonator to get them banned. Apparently, as long as the target has a human in their profile picture the method works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nMwEN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Banning and restoring accounts pays well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3OyrQP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;writes that other users they spoke to also had their accounts banned for being reported for violating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2965449/instagram-self-harm-policy"&gt;Instagram’s policies around suicide and self-harm&lt;/a&gt;, a type of content the company has tried to become even more &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/more-steps-to-keep-instagram-users-safe"&gt;proactive around addressing in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. These bans could have been caused by any variety of scripts that can spam Instagram’s reporting tools without hitting the app’s limits (around 40 reports, apparently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZP838"&gt;The businesses of banning people is very lucrative according to at least one of the people &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;spoke to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5K1drb"&gt;War, the pseudonymous user offering the ban service, told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; in a Telegram message that banning “is pretty much a full time job lol.” They claimed to have made over five-figures from selling Instagram bans in under a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="suIMAQ"&gt;The fact that many of the businesses offering banning services also offered help getting accounts back, sometimes for anywhere between $3,500 to $4,000, probably doesn’t hurt either. Some users noted that they received offers of account help immediately after their accounts were disabled, and that often the Instagram account that reported them was following the Instagram account that offered help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGKm6r"&gt;Instagram did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the company told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that it was investigating sites that offered banning services, and that users should report people they suspect are guilty of that kind of activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UszCvH"&gt;If you believe your account has been disabled or banned, Instagram &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/366993040048856"&gt;offers instructions in its Help Center&lt;/a&gt; on how to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xhr6Lh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Halo band can share your heart rate to other apps and workout equipment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The three color options for the Halo Band" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jVhZC2kmMbQJIDQZelQksbd6zQg=/138x0:2363x1483/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684745/Halo_Band_Hero_Colors.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="90QH7r"&gt;Amazon is updating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;its Halo fitness band&lt;/a&gt; today with the ability to share live heart rate information with third-party devices and fitness apps over BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The company is currently partnered with NordicTrack for its iFit service, along with Openfit and CLMBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkrEwl"&gt;Live heart rate has been available to view since launch in the Live tab of the Halo app, but connecting it to display in other apps and devices is just as easy. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G49AV98U5TBYACVG"&gt;Amazon says&lt;/a&gt; you can turn on heart rate sharing by going to the Halo app’s Settings, selecting Heart Rate Sharing, switching it to on, and then following the on-screen prompts to share your heart rate with the other app or device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qt3jgoFH8Goa-inQVhZzT4FIU_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764039/Openfit.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo live heart rate data overlaid in the Openfit app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jMSTAO"&gt;Showing on-screen heart rate is a fairly common feature for fitness services to motivate you while exercising and help explain why you might feel strained during a specific part of your workout. In some cases, on-screen heart rate is a feature that also sells other devices, like how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; requires the use of an Apple Watch for features like its “Burn Bar.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szwfLC"&gt;The Halo band already working with a few more services is a real plus if you don’t want to be locked into a specific service. Flipping the switch on live heart rate monitoring is also just the latest way Amazon has supported its device post-launch with software features. In June, Amazon added the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465737/amazon-halo-fitness-phone-camera-measure-movement-health"&gt;for its app and band to monitor “movement health.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available online now at Walmart (Update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bjEjtNoRj9yx23VZM0T4lLefmw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684582/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qc82Bf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 5th, 4:07 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Xbox Series X is no longer in stock at Walmart and the rolling restocks appear to have concluded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPoHXb"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F141335186&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; is available online for delivery through Walmart. It’s also offering both the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 disc-based console&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F493824815&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;digital version&lt;/a&gt;. The pricier and more powerful Series X that has a disc drive and 1TB of storage has been almost as tough to find as the PlayStation 5, so this restock is very welcome news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DBLF8t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4G7DpQ"&gt;If this is your first time jumping into the ring, there are a few bits of advice that might lead to success for you. Don’t leave the site if the console appears to sell out immediately. Walmart usually releases stock in 10-minute intervals, with the next being at 3:50PM, 4PM, and so forth until it runs out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wdz7DM"&gt;I recommend ensuring that you sign in to your Walmart account ahead of time to make sure that your shipping and payment settings are just the way you want them. Lastly, be patient, as sometimes the “add to cart” button will pop up after it appears to be sold out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5ubig"&gt;We’ll update this post if more retailers offer the new Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CUs33L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sTMezi"&gt;One of the great things about getting an Xbox console is you’ll be able to access a trove of games with the affordable Game Pass Ultimate subscription. If you aren’t sure which games to get, I suggest signing up for a month to start, which should be around $1 if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bH0R88"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vg27ec"&gt;Other things to consider are accessories. Online retailer Antonline is currently offering a bundle containing the Xbox Wireless Headset and an official Microsoft wireless controller for $140. Purchasing them separately would usually cost you $165.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4G7DpQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 5th, 4:07PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart is sold out of PS5 consoles for the moment. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpWwfJ"&gt;If you haven’t been able to secure a PlayStation 5, you might be in luck. Walmart has opened orders for the PS5 (online only); this includes the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 disc-based version&lt;/a&gt; of the console as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F979738052" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 digital disc-less version&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, it’s usually the first who gets the worm, but not always. If you miss out on the first wave at Walmart, the retailer usually releases more in 10-minute intervals, with the next being at 3:10PM, 3:20PM, and so forth until it runs out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T2BM0q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Wdz7DM"&gt;Also, if you don’t get lucky at first, persist! Sometimes, the “add to cart” button will pop up intermittently, so just be patient and watch closely. It’ll only help your chances of securing a console if you sign in to your Walmart account and ensure that all of your shipping and payment details are set so you can fly through checkout if you get a PS5 in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI5wAx"&gt;We’ll add more retailers to this post if any join in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9FpTcg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WMKy7m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArYNbs"&gt;If all you wanted was the console, well, you’re all set with the links above. But there are several games and accessories you could add to your cart right now that’ll let you have more fun with your PS5 when it arrives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t2rSE8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s office workers now won’t return until early 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJ_he9UhXKt5hoopMnBSu8CXubo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684517/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="INy2FQ"&gt;Amazon’s corporate workers &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/amazon-postpones-return-to-office-until-january-2022-.html"&gt;won't be returning to its offices until January 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. This marks a delay of around four months, as the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/amazon-wants-office-workers-back-3-days-a-week-in-september?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;company’s previous plan&lt;/a&gt; called for employees to return on a hybrid basis starting on September 7th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTT7vm"&gt;Amazon released updated return-to-office procedures for its employees in June, and it tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that wearing masks will be optional for fully vaccinated employees but required for everyone else. The &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance"&gt;company’s news post&lt;/a&gt; about the return to office guidance stated that employees could expect a hybrid work model, with the standard being three days in the office and two remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7u7J5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many of Amazon’s workers have been working on-site throughout the pandemic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mjgPIR"&gt;The news of Amazon pushing back its in-person working plans comes as many other tech companies are reconsidering how to bring workers back. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607690/microsoft-proof-vaccination-covid-19-us-buildings-office-reopening"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have all recently announced that their office workers would have to be vaccinated to return. Last month, Amazon said it &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-covid-vaccine-mandate-11627582286"&gt;wouldn’t require its employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, and its masking requirements for non-vaccinated employees implies that’s still its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76P9rB"&gt;Of course, many of Amazon’s workers, including its warehouse and Whole Foods staff, have been working on-site throughout the pandemic. In October 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497941/amazon-disclose-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;Amazon reported&lt;/a&gt; that from March 1st to September 19th, 2020, almost 20,000 of its frontline employees either tested positive or were presumed positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DThBUM"&gt;In July 2021, Amazon said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22584386/amazon-end-onsite-covid-19-testing-us-warehouses"&gt;halting its on-site testing program&lt;/a&gt; for its warehouses but that it would resume the tests if official health guidance changed. Amazon says it’s still following local regulations and guidance, but it decided to wind down its warehouse testing sites due to the widespread availability of testing in the US. This does, however, put the burden of finding and visiting a testing site onto the workers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow lawsuit has unearthed a huge problem with streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwjrDBcyvWGixMe5vUB1t3ojU00=/0x0:2505x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684386/fbg7020_comp_v003_bf38a189.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urGHo9"&gt;This summer’s biggest Hollywood attraction is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;a multimillion-dollar battle between two of the industry’s best-known players&lt;/a&gt;: Scarlett Johansson and Disney. Johansson sued Disney last week over its day-and-date release of her Marvel superhero film &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, which put the movie on Disney Plus the same day it hit theaters, potentially depriving her of a huge box-office-infused paycheck. The aftermath has been chaotic, but it’s more importantly illuminated the myriad ways that streaming has forever changed the way we experience movies and the implications for the creatives and talent who make them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3amZ80"&gt;Movie contracts have traditionally been negotiated around box office results, with sizable bonuses tied to how well a film performed. This worked out well for both talent and studios. Studios saved a chunk of money up front and didn’t risk spending big on a flop, while actors, producers, and others involved in a film could look at box office results to see exactly what their production was worth and get paid accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GR0buB"&gt;But with the shift to streaming, things have had to change. Actors and producers working with a streamer like Netflix are typically paid a set fee, an industry attorney who negotiates contracts for top-level talent told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. (The attorney asked not to be named so as to speak freely about the topic.) If they’re lucky enough to have significant leverage, they could also potentially secure a bonus premium fee that’s a contractual dollar amount paid out over months or quarters. But it’s not performance-based like box office bonuses are. Netflix often pays out this prenegotiated sum in eight quarterly installments following a title’s release, the attorney said, while Apple tends to pay out a little quicker over 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NSgME"&gt;Because the space is changing so quickly, part of this attorney’s role in contract negotiations now is to “read the tea leaves and project where the deals are going to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3QEjds"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lawyers have to “read the tea leaves and project where the deals are going to go”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qC7HLT"&gt;The old way of negotiating talent earnings has changed rapidly. According to Johansson’s complaint, terms of her &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; release were initially finalized in 2017 — early enough that Disney Plus hadn’t been announced, and Johansson’s team evidently didn’t think it was necessary to negotiate terms around streaming. Her contract specified &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; would debut with a “wide theatrical release,” but that it would be &lt;em&gt;exclusively &lt;/em&gt;theatrical appears to have been only an understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzWLjb"&gt;While actors know now that they need to negotiate terms for streaming, determining their worth is more difficult than simply looking to box office receipts. Streaming services hold their performance data extremely close to the chest, and they’re reluctant to share specifics about engagement and earnings on specific titles. Data that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; shared is often &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflixs-most-important-metric-2016-2"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/those-hbo-max-numbers-arent-what-they-seem-1846752112"&gt;obscured&lt;/a&gt;, or lacking context for how a title’s success (or failure) was measured by respective streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57heDu"&gt;“I don’t see Netflix wanting to share how much of their subscriber base is growing and what their viewership is any time soon,” the attorney said. “But we would like to see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgDTRJ"&gt;This is one reason why industry analysts who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; expressed a need for greater transparency by not just Disney but all streamers about performance data of titles on their platforms. Without it, it’s difficult for talent to advocate for themselves in negotiations in a swiftly evolving streaming landscape, argued&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Karie Bible, a media analyst with Exhibitor Relations Co. who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oGKRF"&gt;“The streamers are, for the most part, pretty darned nontransparent about numbers, about breakdowns, about demographics,” Bible said, adding that this information is not only crucial for analysts but agents, managers, and lawyers, too, who have traditionally negotiated based on box office performance. What this lack of transparency by streamers can lead to is not only mistrust, but possibly even more of what Bible described as “creative accounting” by companies who aren’t forthright during contract negotiations. And that could potentially mean lost earnings for talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pKfmjT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The streamers are, for the most part, pretty darned nontransparent about numbers, about breakdowns, about demographics”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CkPVLk"&gt;Another thing to consider is that each individual streamer’s metrics for success are, by and large, unclear. Box office numbers offer a clear picture of how a movie performed relative to its budget and projected ticket sales. But with streaming, none of us really know what a win looks like — huge viewership numbers, new signups, repeat views — short of the company telling us that a movie was one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3bqSZ"&gt;“I think we have to understand this lawsuit in the context of the redefined success metrics for any movie in the market today,” Daniel Loria, SVP of content strategy and editorial director at Boxoffice Pro, said by phone. “Unfortunately, we are all in the dark as to what that success means in the streaming era — not just the COVID era — but the streaming as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rS7K69"&gt;Like Bible, Loria added that it’s likely frustrating for people in the entertainment industry who stand to benefit from streamer-produced titles but are not getting enough transparency around data and seemingly arbitrarily concocted metrics for success, which can vary by company and service. That could lead to top-name talent thinking twice about engaging in these types of agreements, or at the very least demanding clauses that protect their earnings in the event that a film’s release rollout is changed by a streaming-adjacent studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1N57uy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It seems right now like every studio is playing by a different set of rules and different metrics on what is financially successful and what isn’t”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4mNR8"&gt;“If the industry wants to redefine the metrics of success for a movie, it needs to be on the same page on what that definition is,” Loria said. “And it seems right now like every studio is playing by a different set of rules and different metrics on what is financially successful and what isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tWKMB"&gt;Now, negotiations are not going to operate the same way for every actor. Streaming services are willing to shell out more for talent if they believe the production is likely to drive subscriptions to the service, the Hollywood attorney told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That in itself presents a lot of opportunity for talent willing to join a production that may be a straight-to-streaming release, as we’ve seen play out on services like Netflix and Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqiM8E"&gt;“I think in our business, high-end talent has always had leverage and will continue to have leverage,” the attorney said. At the same time, the attorney pointed to a “maelstrom” of two significant influences, COVID-19 and a new streaming era, that has complicated contracts negotiated prior to either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdfd7L"&gt;Whether Johansson’s lawsuit is settled out of court is less important than what we’ve learned from Disney’s response to it: streaming services are being intentionally obtuse about how owning every single element of production, including releases, and an insatiable appetite for streaming influence is impacting the entertainment industry. No one’s sure what success looks like today, and that’s made knowing who’s winning and who’s losing hard to size up. Short of streamers making that data more transparent and available, the people who make the stuff we watch are walking into negotiations blind. And ultimately, what’s bad for streaming is bad for viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is creating a single OneNote for Windows app with a visual refresh</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vc5nlZr6dHvEz8M-5lbyXrKoAmE=/11x0:481x313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684082/OneNotePM_2_1628115749181.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new OneNote visual refresh.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OoQbrW"&gt;Microsoft is planning to unify its OneNote and OneNote for Windows 10 apps into a single OneNote app. The software maker is taking all the improvements in its UWP OneNote for Windows 10 app and bringing them over to the traditional OneNote desktop app instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vR4xvl"&gt;These improvements will appear in a series of updates over the next 12 months to the traditional OneNote desktop app that installs as part of Office. The updates include a visual refresh and “key existing features currently unique to OneNote for Windows 10.” It’s not clear which features from OneNote for Windows 10 will make their way over to the OneNote desktop app, but &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/office-365-blog/what-s-coming-to-onenote/ba-p/2612960"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; “we are working to ensure that all the most loved features will continue to be a part of OneNote.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/atN17Waz5XGxl0nK3A1dbzb8sTw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763938/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mockup of the changes coming to OneNote on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6iCJnD"&gt;Existing users of the dedicated OneNote for Windows 10 app will be asked to upgrade to the full desktop OneNote app in the second half of 2022. “Advances in Windows and Office will allow us to unify the two apps so that you’ll have the simplicity of a single OneNote app on Windows while enjoying the interface and features you’re already familiar with,” explains the OneNote team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CISON3"&gt;While Microsoft won’t immediately kill off the UWP version of OneNote for Windows 10, the company does note that OneNote users should move to the desktop app by October 2025, when OneNote for Windows 10 will reach end of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wxv5wS"&gt;These changes to OneNote on Windows won’t affect Microsoft’s other OneNote apps for macOS, iOS, Android, or the web. It’s simply Microsoft unifying its separate OneNote apps into something that hopefully has the best of the UWP and desktop worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is the best gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is the best gaming laptop you can buy for $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. You can buy it for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tCRMB0"&gt;A gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;
