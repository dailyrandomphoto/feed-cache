    <title>A show about Gawker proved too hot for Apple to handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OuhDsLWx-0TnonkXLoi3zjdjnCU=/74x0:1451x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514003/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBwXnT"&gt;Apple has killed an upcoming Apple TV Plus show about &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, a now-defunct news organization, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html"&gt;a report by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The show, called &lt;em&gt;Scraper&lt;/em&gt;, is one to add to the list of stories about Apple killing projects that touch things that are too sensitive or edgy for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpiG4e"&gt;When Tim Cook found out that Apple was working on the show, he reportedly sent an email saying that he was surprised to hear about it. He also mentioned he disliked Gawker. Although Apple has decided to kill the project, the show is back on the market, where another distributor could buy and finance it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iUD5oT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qJbxxa"&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy. In 2018 Apple reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880"&gt;killed a movie about Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt; for having gratuitous violence and sex, and Apple executive Eddy Cue has reportedly said that the service will never do two things: “hardcore nudity and China”. Apple directed show-runners to avoid portraying China in a negative light, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/apple-china-tv-protesters-hong-kong-tim-cook"&gt;Buzzfeed has reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqxZkY"&gt;The executive who bought the show, Layne Eskridge, is leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unkwOG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; was inherently controversial — as Tim Cook personally knew. &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; outed him as gay in 2008. The Gawker Media Group&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;included several blogs; in 2010, one of them, &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-apple-lost-the-iphone-4-5520438"&gt;found and leaked the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt; before it was launched. (Later, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/police-seize-jason-chens-computers-5524843"&gt;the reporter’s home was raided by police.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1QCL6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; is appealing as a show precisely because the blog has such a mixed legacy. It was one of the media outlets that &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/who-wants-to-remember-bill-cosbys-multiple-sex-assaul-1515923178"&gt;revived interest in Bill Cosby&lt;/a&gt;, who was later convicted of aggravated indecent assault. It also reported on rumored misconduct by Louis CK and &lt;a href="http://defamer.gawker.com/tell-us-what-you-know-about-harvey-weinsteins-open-sec-1695071092"&gt;Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JAHlR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker &lt;/em&gt;alums Max Read and Cord Jefferson are attached to the show. Jefferson has also written for &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Master of None. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVk0I9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, it seems, was born to bring controversy to everything it touched — even four years after its death.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA approves genetically engineered pigs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xfncn6mgrO_BijrsRxEvFonuKs=/0x0:2766x1844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68513333/1228295080.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yOViUs"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved genetically engineered pigs for use in food and medical products. The pigs, developed by medical company Revivicor, could be used in the production of drugs, to provide organs and tissues for transplants, and to produce meat that’s safe to eat for people with meat allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rT4yX"&gt;“Today’s first-ever approval of an animal biotechnology product for both food and as a potential source for biomedical use represents a tremendous milestone for scientific innovation,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uz6qT"&gt;The pigs are called GalSafe pigs because they lack a molecule called alpha-gal sugar, which can trigger allergic reactions. Alpha-gal sugar is found in many mammals, but not usually in humans. Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), which causes a serious meat allergy, can happen after a bite from a lone star or deer tick. Though it hasn’t been tested specifically for people with AGS yet, the FDA has determined GalSafe pork products are safe for the general population to eat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izmh9N"&gt;In addition to their potential for safer consumption, there are several potential medical uses for GalSafe pigs. They could be used to make drugs like heparin, a common blood-thinner derived from animal tissue, safer for people with AGS. GalSafe pigs could also be useful in organ transplants, as alpha-gal sugar can be a cause of organ rejection. The pigs haven’t been tested for transplantation potential yet, so further research is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7ngQ3"&gt;This isn’t the first time the FDA has approved genetically modified animals. In 2009, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/business/07goatdrug.html"&gt;approved genetically altered goats&lt;/a&gt; that produce a drug in their milk for preventing blood clots. Chickens that can make a drug in their eggs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/9/9879678/gmo-chicken-transgenic-fda-approved-kanuma-drug-eggs"&gt;were approved in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the same year salmon became the first genetically modified animal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/19/9761468/fda-approval-gmo-aquadvantage-salmon-safe"&gt;to be approved for eating&lt;/a&gt;. But the GalSafe pigs mark the first time the FDA has granted approval of a genetically altered animal for both human consumption and medical use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bXsTl"&gt;These pigs are not superpigs à la &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/27/15878944/okja-review-netflix-tilda-swinton-superpig-gyllenhaal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okja&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or Atwood’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/8/11885596/margaret-atwood-dystopian-future-handmaids-tale-maddaddam-pigoons"&gt;pigoons&lt;/a&gt;. The only difference between them and their unaltered peers is a lack of a specific sugar molecule. Any developers that want to use GalSafe pigs will have to seek further FDA approval before using new drugs, transplants, or implants in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google discontinues the Google Home Max </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yiw50PMbDxPaaY4f-6lvydId1Ys=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68513109/google_home_max_review_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F3D1fk"&gt;Google is no longer manufacturing the Google Home Max, its smart speaker designed with high-quality sound in mind, and it has sold out of the product on the Google Store, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, if you check the Google Home Max page &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_home_max"&gt;on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that the white and black models are listed as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOhs3q"&gt;Even though Google is discontinuing the Google Home Max, the company still plans to support it with software updates and security fixes. “Existing Google Home Max users shouldn’t worry as they won’t see any change in their service,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “We’ll continue to offer software updates and security fixes to Google Home Max devices. We’re committed to delivering great sound and whole home audio features across all of our Assistant-enabled products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLa5dQ"&gt;The Google Home Max launched in December 2017 for $399. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16797728/google-home-max-smart-speaker-assistant-review"&gt;his review&lt;/a&gt;, Dan Seifert found that the Google Home Max sounded good on its own, but wasn’t quite as nice as Sonos’ similar Play:5. Google’s newest smart speaker is the Nest Audio, which it launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The Nest Audio costs $99.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest settles gender discrimination lawsuit brought by former COO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pinterest Takes Stock Public On New York Stock Exchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ap_lm0lAimKc778HIx0ny7zOyg4=/0x0:6693x4462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68513005/1143514663.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N3dVUU"&gt;Pinterest is &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1506293/000150629320000291/pins-20201214.htm"&gt;settling a gender discrimination lawsuit brought by former COO Françoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt; for $22.5 million. Pinterest and Brougher will also jointly contribute $2.5 million to philanthropies supporting women and underrepresented minorities in the tech industry. The remaining amount will be paid to Brougher and her attorneys. News of the agreement was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hyrb7"&gt;The settlement is one of the largest in a publicly announced, individual gender discrimination lawsuit. Brougher’s lawyer told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that while private agreements can be bigger, they don’t hold companies accountable in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gj7KLq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is one of the largest in a publicly announced, individual gender discrimination lawsuit.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PX8CRY"&gt;In her complaint, which was filed in August, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;Brougher said she was paid less than her male colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly left out of important meetings, and given gendered feedback by Pinterest CFO Todd Morgenfeld. When she spoke up about this mistreatment, she says she was fired. Morgenfeld still works at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pwDFl"&gt;The complaint followed public statements from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks&lt;/a&gt;, two Black women on the policy team who said they’d faced racism and sexism at the company. Both said they were underpaid despite leading major initiatives at Pinterest, including banning anti-vax posts and putting an end to the promotion of plantation weddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teivXW"&gt;Ozoma and Banks got less than a year’s severance when they left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkuZtj"&gt;Pinterest announced an outside lawyer was conducting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/pinterest-hires-outside-lawyer-to-investigate-workplace-culture"&gt;an independent investigation into its culture&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of these allegations. Yet more stories continued to pour out. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published an article&lt;/a&gt; detailing new allegations of workplace discrimination and retaliation — particularly for women and people of color on the finance team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJMAsX"&gt;In a joint statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;Brougher and Pinterest said: “Pinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture. Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pushes return to office to September and will test flexible work week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NI_d9NxfAymwxWMdQnLdUEczjoA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512915/acastro_170808_1777_google_logo_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HCPruE"&gt;Google has pushed back its return to the office until September, and will experiment with a hybrid model allowing some employees to work from home part of the week, the company said. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/google-delays-return-to-office-and-eyes-flexible-work-week.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Google CEO Sundar Pichai emailed employees Sunday about plans to test a flexible work week once conditions are safe for people to return. Google employees would work three days in the office and the rest of the week at home under the new plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeUpzt"&gt;Pichai said the company is testing whether such a model would lead to greater productivity and employee well-being. “No company at our scale has ever created a fully hybrid work force model — though a few are starting to test it — so it will be interesting to try,” Pichai wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43NPnw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/google-ceo-email-delays-return-to-sept-2021-no-permanent-remote-work.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1607976163"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, Google’s hybrid work model would require employees to live within commuting distance to their offices, and a fully-remote option wasn’t offered. And some employees may not be eligible for a flexible work week, such as those who need access to specialized equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDdcvd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter, and Square are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21261798/square-employees-work-from-home-remote-premanent-policy-ceo"&gt;among the companies&lt;/a&gt; to announce they would permanently extend their current fully-remote work policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05YOOq"&gt;Google was one of the earliest tech companies to go fully remote as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173994/google-coronavirus-north-american-employees-work-from-home-sick-leave-fund"&gt;telling employees in March&lt;/a&gt; to work from home to support social distancing. It previously said it would keep its 200,000 full-time and contract employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340038/google-remote-working-employees-2021-twitter-facebook-alphabet"&gt;working remotely until July 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but has now pushed that date back again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber fined $59 million for dodging questions about sexual assaults</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfNE6aIeei3CYmxhy3nvs_MEABY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512756/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QJe06T"&gt;Uber has 30 days to pay a $59 million fine to California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for failing to answer the regulator’s questions about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;damning safety report&lt;/a&gt; released by the company in December 2019. If Uber doesn’t pay up &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;answer the outstanding questions, CPUC could suspend the company’s license to operate in the state, an &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M354/K636/354636771.PDF"&gt;administrative law judge ruled on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc8ov0"&gt;It’s the latest development in Uber’s long history of trouble with violence and assault between its drivers and passengers — trouble that competitor Lyft shares, too. News of the fine was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-to-Uber-Pay-59-million-and-give-data-15801080.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hLPHRr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Regulators want to know more about Uber’s own damning safety report, released in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHHRZw"&gt;The report, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;Uber itself called “jarring” at the time&lt;/a&gt;, detailed thousands of sexual assaults in the US that happened in 2017 and 2018 during trips taken with the company’s ride-hailing platform. While the &lt;a href="https://www.uber-assets.com/image/upload/v1575580686/Documents/Safety/UberUSSafetyReport_201718_FullReport.pdf"&gt;84-page report&lt;/a&gt; included a fair amount of data in aggregate, CPUC wanted to know more shortly after it was released — especially because Uber admitted in the fine print that the report did not “assess or take any position on whether any of the reported incidents actually occurred.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk0HKn"&gt;The CPUC has regulatory authority over transportation companies in the state and regularly investigates complaints against them. So it asked Uber a handful of questions about who authored the report, and also asked Uber for specific details on each incident of assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCX7dX"&gt;Uber never answered the questions, claiming that further disclosure would present a privacy risk for both the assault survivors as well as its employees. In January 2020, a judge denied the company’s request to avoid answering, saying Uber could file the answers under seal in order to protect confidentiality. Uber continued to fight answering the CPUC’s questions throughout the year until up Monday’s ruling, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RX5NI"&gt;In the ruling, the judge described those efforts as little more than “specious legal roadblocks” meant to “frustrate the Commission’s ability to gather information” about whether Uber is operating safely. They did, however, say that Uber can use “a code or some other signifier rather than a victim’s name” when it eventually answers the CPUC’s questions. The judge arrived at the $59 million figure by levying a $7,500 fine for every specific time that Uber refused to answer each question during the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8buolO"&gt;“Uber is a billion-dollar business that can easily afford to pay ... [e]ven during a pandemic where ridership has undoubtedly declined,” the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWR25S"&gt;The CPUC has been “insistent in its demands that we release the &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;contact information&lt;/em&gt; of sexual assault survivors without their consent,” Uber said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. “&lt;/em&gt;We opposed this shocking violation of privacy, alongside many victims’ rights advocates. Now, a year later, the CPUC has changed its tune: we can provide anonymized information—yet we are also subject to a $59 million fine for not complying with the very order the CPUC has fundamentally altered.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VJ05B"&gt;Uber further said these “punitive and confusing actions will do nothing to improve public safety and will only create a chilling effect as other companies consider releasing their own reports. Transparency should be encouraged, not punished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwUTVK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 14th, 6:36PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Uber.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike the regular Switch, this model has a few standout features that make it one of the best-looking Switch models to date. It includes pastel green and blue Joy-Con, a white dock adorned with images of the Nook family, and the back of the Switch has an embossed design with little icons associated with the game.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veAGHSQdVpomFEThPomQmjmS1bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070145/jbareham_1492_170228_0275.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yrravQwglpzWOC1tZVT479bwzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=03e07706174eba9d98e121bd33c717da&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=40eaf677c94a1341b4ed7beb385dbb06&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $7&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney World is going to stop photoshopping masks onto people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of the castle at Disney World Orlando" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UyM6V5g7RwaBAB_DVD62Skj5YI0=/0x316:1331x1203/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512541/walt_disney_world_castle.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Becky O’Bryan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SgOYS"&gt;Today in stories that make you go “Wait, &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;”, &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/update-walt-disney-world-no-longer-placing-digital-face-masks-over-maskless-guests-in-on-ride-photos-statement-issued/"&gt;Disney World is going to stop digitally adding masks&lt;/a&gt; to people who don’t have them in their on-ride pictures, according to a report from &lt;em&gt;WDW News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT0y7W"&gt;Even if you’ve never been to a theme park, you’ve probably seen these kinds of photos: people on a roller coaster screaming or reacting in some funny way to whatever’s happening, captured by a camera built into the ride and sold at some crazy price. In the age of COVID-19, however, Disney has had to adapt to how it handles these pictures. For example, previously, if someone wasn’t wearing a mask on the ride, &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/07/guests-not-wearing-face-masks-on-attractions-will-not-receive-in-ride-photo-at-walt-disney-world/"&gt;neither they nor anybody else in the picture&lt;/a&gt; would be able to download it in the Disney app or get it printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iutd5Z"&gt;It’s understandable how this could cause some annoyance — if you were wearing your mask on the ride, why shouldn’t you be able to get the picture just because someone else wasn’t? Disney’s solution to this, apparently, was to start &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/photo-walt-disney-world-now-placing-digital-face-masks-over-maskless-guests-in-on-ride-photos/"&gt;digitally adding masks to non-wearers&lt;/a&gt; (rather poorly, as you can see in the tweet below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you refuse to wear a mask on a Disney ride, cast members will photoshop one onto your face for the picture wall &lt;a href="https://t.co/4gocKiaLx0"&gt;https://t.co/4gocKiaLx0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Claire Downs (@clairecdowns) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clairecdowns/status/1336918024117342209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SErsan"&gt;It’s unclear when exactly Disney started doing this, but it announced over the weekend that it was going to stop, saying in a statement that it had “tested modifying some ride photos”, but that it will “no longer doing this and continue to expect guests to wear face coverings except when actively eating or drinking while stationary.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjph8z"&gt;What’s not clear yet is whether Disney will go back to its stricter photo policy, where it won’t allow anyone in the photo to purchase a copy if someone isn’t wearing a mask in it. Either way, it’s a good idea to wear a mask even regardless of whether your vacation pictures depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook launches its Collab music app to the public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Facebook Collab logo next to a smartphone showing a screenshot of the Collab interface." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gqPy438PDczMoiCXhZ8HY3T43qk=/0x15:768x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512379/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.00.57_AM_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaB9TH"&gt;Facebook has publicly launched Collab, an experimental music-making app that first launched as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21270640/facebook-collab-npe-invite-only-beta-release-music-making-app"&gt;invite-only beta&lt;/a&gt; back in May, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jTqAn"&gt;The app allows users to create short-form music videos by combining up to three independent videos. So, for example, three musicians could each play a different part of a song and combine them into one video. But each video that’s created is also posted to a public “Collab” feed, where people can view and play along with it if they choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FeEiI"&gt;So you could also record one part, then mix it with two other parts you find on the Collab feed that other people have recorded. Or you can just mix other people’s videos together — you don’t need to be a musician yourself. (Every user is properly credited for their contributions, according to Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLWkdJ"&gt;You won’t have to worry about lining all the videos up — Collab includes in-app tools to sync the parts together. Per its App Store page, “We make sure that as you swipe, the videos play at exactly the right moment to be in sync.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nD70JX"&gt;The app isn’t directly integrated with Facebook (yet, at least), but you can export the finished products to your Instagram story (as well as other platforms, including TikTok) via iOS share sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOLd38"&gt;Collab is free on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collab-band-together/id1507800473"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and you can download it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bxwQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woEYCQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 leak shows off the upcoming 2021 flagship in photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewUM02R_Z9tORzE39Ylx8ymVTIk=/0x1:1874x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512324/oneplus_9_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images of a prototype device confirm some previously leaked spec. | Photo: PhoneArena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vov8Sx"&gt;The OnePlus 9 likely won’t arrive until spring 2021, but thanks to some &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-9-5g-hands-on-specs-leak-exclusive_id129026"&gt;photos published by &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we won’t have to wait that long for a glimpse of it. The images are of an alleged prototype device complete with unique pre-prod branding, and some software screengrabs reveal a little extra detail about the upcoming flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG6KWK"&gt;First up: the screen. It looks like OnePlus will stick with the flat screen format it used in the OnePlus 8 and 8T – the 9 has a flat 6.55-inch display with a hole punch camera in the upper left corner. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s screen features a design that curves around the edges of the phone, which we found lead to more accidental touches than occurred with the flat version. &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena &lt;/em&gt;reports that the 9’s screen is a 2400 x 1080 panel with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jFYLMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 8 review: familiar formula","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219278/oneplus-8-review-specs-features-camera-battery-screen-price-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8 Pro review: big league","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8T review: the numbers game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CDjerY"&gt;The pre-prod device also looks to include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888 processor&lt;/a&gt;, the chipset of choice for 2021 flagship phones. And that leads into another previously leaked OnePlus 9 feature: 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbvvAx"&gt;As for imaging hardware, the images show a camera bump pushed to the upper left corner of the device’s rear. There’s also new “Ultrashot” branding on the bump not seen on previous models, though it may or may not remain on the final device. The specs gleaned from this early look don’t give away exact details about camera sensor resolution or focal length, but it seems likely that two of the rear cameras seen in these photos will be standard wide and ultrawide modules. The third could be a macro or depth-sensing camera.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A look at the SIM card slot and USB-C port on the upcoming OnePlus phone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lL48kO"&gt;Other details include a 4500 mAh battery, Android 11 with Oxygen OS, and a version with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM (there will likely be an option with a different memory configuration). There’s no confirmed launch date for the OnePlus 9, but the company’s schedule for past releases — and the timing of this leak — mean early spring 2021 looks likely.&lt;/p&gt;
