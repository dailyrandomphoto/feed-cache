    <title>Watch SpaceX fly a prototype of its Starship rocket to its highest altitude yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izSE1T1styfUSfanRx1Gt8cG_90=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478163/SN8_20201110.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qIK1iO"&gt;Sometime today, SpaceX hopes to conduct a pivotal test flight of its next-generation Starship rocket, flying a prototype of the vehicle to its highest altitude yet. The company plans to launch the massive rocket to a height of nearly 8 miles, or 12.5 kilometers, up above SpaceX’s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, before landing the vehicle back down on the ground again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YISOcP"&gt;The test is meant to prove out Starship’s capability of launching and landing upright, something the spacecraft will be expected to do both on Earth and on other worlds. SpaceX aims to use Starship to send cargo and people to deep-space destinations like the Moon and Mars. A test like this will help demonstrate Starship’s ability to perform a controlled flight and see if the rocket’s hardware — particularly the three main Raptor engines — functions as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFXPd7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Launch and landing are just part of the test today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej2px2"&gt;Launch and landing are just part of today’s test. On its website, SpaceX claims the Starship prototype will actually perform “a landing flip maneuver, which would be a first for a vehicle of this size.” There aren’t many details about the maneuver publicly available, but it’s a risky test that could easily go wrong, with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1331388984023461888?s=20"&gt;only giving the flight a “1/3 chance” of success&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX itself is also deemphasizing the possibility that the test will pull off a perfect launch and landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UA3Gf"&gt;“With a test such as this, success is not measured by completion of specific objectives but rather how much we can learn, which will inform and improve the probability of success in the future as SpaceX rapidly advances development of Starship,” &lt;a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/index.html"&gt;SpaceX wrote about the flight on its website&lt;/a&gt;. But if all goes well, the flight will put the company on course to attempt even more ambitious tests in the future, eventually culminating in Starship’s first launch to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P30HAF"&gt;For this test, SpaceX plans to provide a live stream of the flight, which will go live just ahead of takeoff. However, it’s hard to give a solid time for when that will happen. The Federal Aviation Administration released flight restrictions for the airspace around Boca Chica from 9AM to 6PM ET, and there are flight restrictions in place for Thursday and Friday of this week, too. “The schedule is dynamic and likely to change, as is the case with all development testing,” SpaceX writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUCPgz"&gt;SpaceX attempted a launch on Tuesday but aborted just a second before liftoff. Now it seems the company is targeting this afternoon for a flight test. The company will &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX"&gt;provide updates through Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to follow SpaceX throughout the day to catch a glimpse of this rocket’s flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Pdviu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 8th, 5:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; SpaceX counted all the way down to launch on Tuesday afternoon, but at 1.3 seconds to liftoff, the Raptor engines initiated an abort, and the Starship prototype didn’t take flight. The company will provide updates about its next launch opportunity &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;on its Twitter account&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google CEO Sundar Pichai apologizes for Timnit Gebru controversy but not her firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Hosts Its Annual I/O Developers Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8y0PpKnweLynxwQaS-Ykurap2k=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486474/1147600084.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rkD4rh"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the controversial departure of AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru in an email to staff on Wednesday. “We need to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily,” he wrote. News of the email was &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html"&gt;first published by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZAAar"&gt;While Pichai did not say Gebru was fired as she and many others have claimed, he promised to review the steps that led to her leaving the company. “We need to assess the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jzOSM"&gt;He also apologized for how Gebru’s departure had “led some in our community to question their place at Google” and promised to consider “de-escalation strategies” for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTayc1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1336758639785365506"&gt;On Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Gebru wrote the note was far from an apology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JMH4hW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Finally it does not say "I'm sorry for what we did to her and it was wrong." What it DOES say is "it seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google." So I see this as "I'm sorry for how it played out but I'm not sorry for what we did to her yet." 4\&lt;/p&gt;— Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1336758639785365506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Psk5PP"&gt;Last week, Gebru tweeted that the company had abruptly fired her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;over an email she sent to the Brain and Women Allies listserv&lt;/a&gt;. In the email, she voiced frustration at the company trying to get her to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;retract a research paper on the risks of large language processing models&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPdGaj"&gt;The email led to a conversation between Gebru and higher-ups at Google Research. Gebru asked for certain conditions to be met in order for her to stay at the company, including knowing the details of who had asked for her paper to be retracted. One of the managers, Megan Kacholia, said the company couldn’t meet those conditions and preemptively accepted her resignation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1beK1w"&gt;Google’s head of AI, Jeff Dean, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;published a note&lt;/a&gt; explaining why Gebru’s paper hadn’t met the company’s standards. He said it had been submitted for review a day before the deadline when the company typically requires two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVttCr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158501/timnit-gebru-team-google-public-statement-fired"&gt;But Gebru’s own team pushed back on this assessment&lt;/a&gt;, writing in a blogpost that the publication review policy was applied “unevenly and discriminatorily.” An internal analysis reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verg&lt;/em&gt;e showed that most publication approvals happen right before the deadline, and 41 percent happen after the deadline. “Numerous papers are approved for publication submission without meeting this ‘requirement,’” the team wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uq6qZR"&gt;On December 4th, the Google Walkout Medium account &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;published a petition protesting Gebru’s firing&lt;/a&gt;. It was signed by 2,278 Google employees and 3,114 industry allies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuVykl"&gt;Read Pichai’s full email here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xiVr69"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRkcD6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the things I’ve been most proud of this year is how Googlers from across the company came together to address our racial equity commitments. It’s hard, important work, and while we’re steadfast in our commitment to do better, we have a lot to learn and improve. An important piece of this is learning from our experiences like the departure of Dr. Timnit Gebru.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXcHrN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve heard the reaction to Dr. Gebru’s departure loud and clear: it seeded doubts and led some in our community to question their place at Google. I want to say how sorry I am for that, and I accept the responsibility of working to restore your trust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AwR6h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;First - we need to assess the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process. We will begin a review of what happened to identify all the points where we can learn — considering everything from de-escalation strategies to new processes we can put in place. Jeff and I have spoken and are fully committed to doing this. One of the best aspects of Google’s engineering culture is our sincere desire to understand where things go wrong and how we can improve.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBHCZ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second - we need to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily. This loss has had a ripple effect through some of our least represented communities, who saw themselves and some of their experiences reflected in Dr. Gebru’s. It was also keenly felt because Dr. Gebru is an expert in an important area of AI Ethics that we must continue to make progress on — progress that depends on our ability to ask ourselves challenging questions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEjy5h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s incredibly important to me that our Black, women, and underrepresented Googlers know that we value you and you do belong at Google. And the burden of pushing us to do better should not fall on your shoulders. We started a conversation together earlier this year when we &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://goto.google.com/kw-progress-on-racial-equity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;announced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; a broad set of racial equity commitments to take a fresh look at all of our systems from hiring and leveling, to promotion and retention, and to address the need for leadership accountability across all of these steps. The events of the last week are a painful but important reminder of the progress we still need to make.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fadS6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a top priority for me and Google leads, and I want to recommit to translating the energy that we’ve seen this year into real change as we move forward into 2021 and beyond. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htJgAK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— Sundar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JaKNi1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s privacy labels are coming to all apps, including its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5ROCKsp-0ZY7kaAJwf6endUcPM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486285/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9NOW6I"&gt;Apple has clarified that its &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/"&gt;mandatory app privacy “nutrition labels”&lt;/a&gt; program will apply to all apps, whether they’re from third-party developers or Apple’s own. It’s an apparent response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;criticism from WhatsApp earlier today&lt;/a&gt; that the program unfairly favored Apple’s services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxSXLx"&gt;That means Apple’s apps on the App Store will receive similar privacy labels when the program rolls out later this year as third-party apps. And for the few iOS apps that aren’t available in the App Store — like Messages, a particular point of contention for WhatsApp — they will have the same privacy information available on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHNjJM"&gt;The statement follows a complaint from WhatsApp from earlier today in which the messaging service claimed that Apple’s system was unfair, as it would only impact third-party services but not Apple’s preinstalled apps. For its part, Apple had never announced any policy to indicate that its apps would be exempt from the privacy label requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s3ZRWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All apps will get privacy labels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L1C0P7"&gt;“We think labels should be consistent across first and third party apps as well as reflect the strong measures apps may take to protect people’s private information,” WhatsApp &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/whatsapp-apple-privacy-label-requirements-cc0d5edd-ab2f-4549-b9d7-ea3c97184056.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a statement earlier today. “While providing people with easy to read information is a good start, we believe it’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed, like iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUG1Fg"&gt;Apple first introduced the privacy labels as part of its WWDC announcements earlier this year. The labels — likened to nutrition facts found on food products — will appear in the App Store and give users easy, glanceable breakdowns of the data that developers can collect and track. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551926/apple-privacy-developers-nutrition-labels-app-store-ios-14"&gt;Developers were required&lt;/a&gt; to start submitting labels for their apps starting on December 8th, and the labels themselves are expected to start appearing “&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moto G Stylus 2021 leak suggests a larger screen and higher price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Moto G Stylus 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfwQ4m86UhQqckE51vhPki_TCsw=/250x0:1750x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486040/Moto_G_Stylus_2021_leaked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Moto G Stylus 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image via Phone Arena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OtVRDQ"&gt;Detailed specs and images of the 2021 Moto G Stylus have leaked by way of an early Amazon listing, as &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-renders-leak_id128790"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This iteration on the stylus-having, budget-friendly device looks to borrow features from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432283/motorola-moto-g9-plus-phone-available-now-brazil"&gt;this year’s Moto G9 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, including a 6.8-inch FHD+ display that’s slightly larger than its predecessor’s 6.4-inch screen. Amazon’s (now removed) page lists a price of $341, which is unlikely to be the final MSRP, but it’s a bit higher than the original G Stylus’ $299 introductory price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WuRkwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new Moto G Stylus and G Power are surprisingly adept cameraphones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OFwmp1"&gt;One of the things we liked best about the prior G Stylus was the image quality from its camera, and Motorola appears to have tweaked the hardware setup in the 2021 version. Aside from a 48-megapixel main rear camera, it adopts the quad-camera array from the Moto G9 Plus, including an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro camera, and 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyBiQr"&gt;The leaked listing shows a few other details, including Android 10 pre-loaded, a 4,000mAh battery, and two color options: “aurora white” and “aurora black.” It will be one of few options for those looking for a stylus bundled with their phone; Samsung’s Galaxy Note series is another one, but those devices are much more expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;may be going away soon&lt;/a&gt;. While Motorola hasn’t given an official launch date for the new G Stylus, it’s safe to assume that the device will be formally revealed soon if retailers are readying listings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is suing Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-t4qaOAuuR7PwP50kffonVhFPqE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486026/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5VbIT"&gt;On Wednesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a massive antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, claiming the social media giant has harmed competition by buying up smaller companies like Instagram and WhatsApp to squash the threat they posed to its business. Forty-seven other state and regional attorneys general are joining the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s9HRV"&gt;The lawsuit centers on Facebook’s acquisitions, particularly its $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2011. In addition to its acquisition strategy, the attorneys general allege that Facebook used the power and reach of its platform to stifle user growth for competing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dl6FFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B0SIUU"&gt;“For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition,” James said in a press conference today. “Facebook used vast amounts of money to acquire potential rivals before they could threaten the company’s dominance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXfkHK"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission brought &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/08/state-federal-suits-against-facebook-expected-as-tech-antitrust-fight-escalates-443859"&gt;a separate lawsuit against Facebook&lt;/a&gt; on similar grounds, announced at the same time as the states’ lawsuit. The FTC case goes further than the state case, explicitly calling on the court to unwind the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, spinning off both into independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwbeAJ"&gt;“Our aim is to roll back Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive,” said Ian Conner, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arfVAn"&gt;The FTC case also echoes the state AGs’ claims about anticompetitive use of platform power, particularly Facebook’s practice of “cutting off API access to blunt perceived competitive threats.” The FTC case cites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents"&gt;Facebook’s decision to block Vine’s friend-finding feature&lt;/a&gt; after the Twitter acquisition as a particularly flagrant instance of this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MI6WS1"&gt;In a newsroom statement, Facebook said both acquisitions had been cleared by regulatory agencies, and that overturning them after the fact would set a dangerous precedent. “Years after the FTC cleared our acquisitions, the government now wants a do-over with no regard for the impact that precedent would have on the broader business community or the people who choose our products every day,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goz4nU"&gt;In emails &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21345723/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing"&gt;revealed by the House of Representatives’ antitrust subcommittee hearing this summer&lt;/a&gt;, Zuckerberg characterized his intent to buy Instagram in emails to his David Ebersman, who was then Facebook’s chief financial officer, as a way to neutralize a competitor while at the same time improving Facebook — by incorporating the features its competitor invented before any other upstart has enough time to catch up and pose a similar threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zqfRuL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It appears Facebook simply bought these firms to expand its dominance”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpjijQ"&gt;“One way of looking at this is that what we’re really buying is time. Even if some new competitors springs up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare, etc now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again. Within that time, if we incorporate the social mechanics they were using, those new products won’t get much traction since we’ll already have their mechanics deployed at scale,” Zuckerberg explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQP0bk"&gt;Within the hour, Zuckerberg sent a follow-up reply, writing, “I didn’t mean to imply that we’d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way,” he wrote. Antitrust lawyers saw that as an admission of guilt from Zuckerberg, who appeared to realize that what he wrote in those emails regarding his acquisition strategy constituted anticompetitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj0GBT"&gt;Another pillar of the states’ antitrust lawsuit is whether Facebook acquiring a company made the product worse off from a consumer benefit standpoint — in particular, with regard to privacy. Facebook has long claimed that its resources and scale are responsible for turning apps like Instagram and WhatsApp into gigantic platforms with billions of users. But investigators targeting the deals for anticompetitive behavior are examining how, for instance, Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp and its decision to later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;utilize WhatsApp user data&lt;/a&gt; may have harmed consumers and stifled competition from rivals with better privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AHUU4"&gt;Notably, the creators of both Instagram and WhatsApp have left Facebook — some, like WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955638/whatsapp-brian-acton-facebook-delete-mark-zuckerberg-signal-encryption"&gt;vocally disagreeing with the direction Facebook took his product&lt;/a&gt; and what the company has done to privacy in general. WhatsApp’s other co-founder, Jan Koum, left shortly after Acton, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17304792/whatsapp-jan-koum-facebook-data-privacy-encryption"&gt;reportedly clashed with Facebook leadership&lt;/a&gt; over its data-sharing initiative. Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left the company over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking"&gt;years of built-up tensions&lt;/a&gt; between the photo-sharing app and its relationship to Facebook’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HnaiT"&gt;The actions are already drawing applause from antitrust advocates in Congress. Representative David Cicilline (D-RI), who led the House Antitrust hearing in July, cheered on the lawsuits in a statement to the press. “Facebook is a monopoly,” said Rep. Cicilline. “Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up. I applaud the FTC and state attorneys general who are leading this effort today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg2MIo"&gt;Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) echoed the comments, taking particular aim at the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions. “Rather than competing with Instagram and WhatsApp, it appears Facebook simply bought these firms to expand its dominance,” said Rep. Nadler. “This should never have happened in the first place, and accountability is long overdue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QG221T"&gt;The lawsuit marks the second major regulatory effort from the US government to rein in Big Tech, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Google in October&lt;/a&gt; for alleged illegal monopolization of the search and online ad markets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise is now testing fully driverless cars in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Self-propelled car GM Cruise" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSWtiMLpdAxH7cFets7rVOKqucQ=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485294/1150127517.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fpv4cx"&gt;Cruise, the self-driving car company affiliated with General Motors and Honda, is testing fully driverless cars, without a human safety driver behind the steering wheel, in San Francisco. The company is among the first to test its driverless vehicles in a dense, complex urban environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro4Wgn"&gt;“Getting to driverless in SF took more than five years of rigorous testing, over 2 million miles of driving in one of the craziest driving environments, together with hard work from a huge team of dedicated engineers and others across Cruise, as well as at GM,” Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a call with reporters. “And not to mention several billion dollars of investment along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvXu7p0OD6NO-Ul6mgDPQjs1wzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22157426/Cruise_Going_Driverless_By_The_Numbers.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OLEBR"&gt;To be sure, the vehicles are not completely alone in the wilderness. In a video released by the company, a Cruise employee is seen in the passenger seat while the car drives itself through the darkened streets of San Francisco. Cruise’s vehicles all have an emergency switch in the center channel near the gear shift in case something goes wrong, and they are also monitored remotely by Cruise employees. Asked whether remote operators are able to take control of the vehicle when needed, Ammann declined to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wn1Jsl"&gt;“The safety operator has the ability to bring the vehicle to a stop in the event of an emergency, but does not have access to standard driver controls,” a spokesperson said. “Eventually, this safety operator will be fully removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DC8i3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517833/cruise-driverless-cars-test-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Cruise was approved to test fully driverless cars&lt;/a&gt; (also called Level 4 in industry parlance) in California on October 15th. According to the DMV, Cruise can only test five driverless vehicles “on specified streets within San Francisco.” The vehicles are not allowed to exceed 30 mph, and can’t operate during heavy fog or heavy rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wykK7e"&gt;Cruise was the fifth company to receive a driverless permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, the others being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044670/waymo-fully-driverless-car-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/zoox-becomes-fourth-company-to-land-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/"&gt;Zoox&lt;/a&gt;, and AutoX. Currently, 60 companies have an active permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SaH27r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the first time that Cruise has demonstrated its Level 4 capabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CnLyqr"&gt;This is the first time that Cruise has demonstrated its Level 4 capabilities. Its main rival, Google spinoff Waymo, has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;testing its fully driverless vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix for over a year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be making its Level 4 taxi service available to more customers. Cruise doesn’t allow non-employees to ride in its vehicles. The company had planned to launch a commercial taxi service in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;but failed to do so&lt;/a&gt;, and it has yet to publicly commit to a new date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QH4k5e"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;Cruise unveiled the Cruise Origin&lt;/a&gt;, a fully driverless prototype vehicle without a steering wheel, pedals, or any controls typically associated with human driving. The vehicle, which will go into production at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt;, is built to be shared by multiple passengers — though it remains to be seen how much appetite there is for shared vehicles in a post-COVID world. Cruise recently unveiled a new set of safety protocols intended to keep people socially distant during trips and the vehicle sanitized between fares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ug9q3"&gt;The news that the company will be relying less on its operations staff during its testing comes after Cruise’s safety drivers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21473719/waymo-cruise-self-driving-car-backup-safety-driver-pandemic-wildfires-california"&gt;complained about a lack of safety standards&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic and subsequent wildfires. They accuse Cruise of deploying its self-driving cars during the spring lockdown &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286301/cruise-self-driving-car-testing-san-francisco-stay-home-order"&gt;in defiance of public health orders&lt;/a&gt; banning nonessential travel. And they say Cruise isn’t doing enough to keep them safe during these public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pDpm7A"&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s redesigned Fire TV software starts rolling out today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw409VoTcNy4HtaJSpW11IVPgXU=/119x0:1417x865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485133/NewFireTV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hfn4yn"&gt;The software that runs on Amazon’s Fire TV streaming devices is set to undergo a significant overhaul in the coming weeks, and the rollout of the “new Fire TV experience” begins today on some devices. After the update is installed, you’ll have access to new features like multiuser support (with personalized recommendations and watch lists for each profile) and a streamlined interface that makes it faster to reach your favorite entertainment apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk6xjY"&gt;When you’re in the mood to watch something but you’re not sure what, there’s also a new “Find” tab that brings together movies, TV shows, free ad-supported content, and sports from various services. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EUxilEet9CGXCABt7jt4cWSvgPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22157413/Screen_Shot_2020_12_09_at_12.16.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now have individual user profiles on the Fire TV — including kids accounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AToeyj"&gt;Amazon has also improved Alexa integration with the new Fire TV dashboard. If you set up a voice profile, Alexa will be able to recognize your voice and automatically switch to the right profile when you ask it to, and you can switch between various sections (live TV, news, etc.) with voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DK0ue9"&gt;The new experience also adds support for picture-in-picture and less intrusive on-screen Alexa responses when you ask for things like the weather; it’ll now appear at the bottom of the screen instead of covering the content you’re watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li9B4W"&gt;Oddly, Amazon is rolling out this new software first to its recently introduced Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite; higher-end devices like the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube will have to wait until early 2021. Only a small subset of eligible devices will get it right away; Amazon doesn’t revamp the Fire TV interface often, so the company is taking its time to make sure everything goes smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spider-Man: Miles Morales runs at 60fps with ray tracing in new mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dRF-rG-B6ZEyN7wTLJPstkEwO4k=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485095/MilesMorales_PS5_Standoff_Legal_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qnd8gn"&gt;At launch, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation 5 was able to run at 60fps in Performance mode or at 30fps but with ray tracing in Fidelity mode, meaning that you’d have to pick between buttery-smooth frame rates or higher graphical fidelity while playing through the game. Thanks to a new mode added in an update, though, you can now run the game at 60fps &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRaY0E"&gt;The new mode is called “Performance RT,” and you can turn it on in settings. “This is an alternate version of the 60 frames per second ‘Performance’ mode, adding ray-tracing by adjusting the scene resolution, reflection quality, and pedestrian density,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ax_zer0/status/1336643995515170816"&gt;according to the description of the new mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="coKzTW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our new update overnight introduced Performance RT mode on PS5. 60fps and ray-tracing! &lt;a href="https://t.co/SSRy9vq9Aw"&gt;https://t.co/SSRy9vq9Aw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1336698057900007424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NGtnFC"&gt;It’s not clear exactly how the resolution of the game is changed in the Performance RT mode. And we don’t know if the new mode will also be coming to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, the updated version of the 2018 hit that’s available as part of the $70 &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;. Sony and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; developer Insomniac Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4auH0"&gt;The new Performance RT mode seems like it could be the ideal way to experience &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;. I haven’t played the game yet, but when I do, I know I’ll be turning on the Performance RT mode to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch overhauls its rules around harassment and hateful conduct </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6dQAVKL46mPU44aGZ1IjtWRdSa8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484822/acastro_190926_1777_twitch_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DYEAaG"&gt;Today, Twitch is announcing changes to its policies around harassment and hateful conduct. The reason, the company says, is because marginalized people — “women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Black, Indigenous, and people of color,” the company wrote in a blog post — are disproportionately harassed on the site. The new policy is far more specific about what constitutes harassment and abuse. The larger changes include stricter protections around sexual harassment, the policy extending off platform to an extent, and that enforcement in cases that are harder to judge will rely on external signals that the behavior was unwanted (like channel timeouts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMgUAv"&gt;A bigger overhaul has come to Twitch’s policy regarding sexual harassment; it’s now much more stringent in what is and isn’t permitted, and it now has its own category in the terms of service. The policy now prohibits “[r]epeatedly commenting on someone’s perceived attractiveness, even in what you believe to be a positive or complimentary manner,” if there’s an indication the behavior is unwelcome (if you’ve been asked to stop, been banned from the channel, or timed out); it also forbids “[m]aking lewd or explicit comments about anyone’s sexuality or physical appearance,” specifically stating that the company will not make an exception for public figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvLVpG"&gt;Twitch says that new rules will apply to content created on January 22nd — the day it goes into effect — and afterward. The company also says that while the policy is more stringent in some ways, it will also dole out punishments according to severity. Enforcement will also depend on signals from targeted individuals in cases where potentially offending behavior is more subjective. “In the event of a more subjective situation, for example competitive banter or trash talk, will rely on signals from the person being targeted, or their mods, so that we can take appropriate action and avoid punishing users in situations where that behavior is welcome,” the company wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ovxCm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stream sniping gets its own line&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbLjX6"&gt;Mostly, it seems that the new policy is aimed at plugging the holes in the old one. For example, the Confederate flag is now banned in chat, and promoting “hateful viewpoints under the guise of education or comedy” will lead to a suspension. Stream sniping gets its own line; it’s banned. And broadcasters who don’t make an effort to curtail “incitement or organization of abuse” in their own channels will be banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2LtLA"&gt;Twitch says it has worked with its Safety Advisory Council and industry experts for months on the new rules, and the effort shows. Streamers and audiences should read the new guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, because they’re worth reading in full. Twitch is also hosting three events over the next month to familiarize broadcasters and their communities with the new rules: a “Creator Camp” discussion of the policy on December 11th, a town hall on December 16th covering enforcement, and a final Creator Camp on January 6th to review the policy again and answer frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W9mat"&gt;All told, it looks like Twitch has decided to take serious action against its most toxic users. But as with any policy, its effectiveness depends on the company’s willingness to enforce its own rules. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches health research app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google New York Chelsea Office (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqYtOgIQB8yUItQCuEiNNutl8RI=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484694/google-logo-stock-31_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4ivc0"&gt;Google announced Wednesday that it is launching a new research app for Android phones, which would allow anyone with a device to participate in medical studies. The first study run through the app, called Google Health Studies, will look at respiratory illnesses like the flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJVlhD"&gt;Participants in the study will use the app to report any respiratory symptoms, the precautions they’re taking to prevent disease, and whether they’ve been tested for COVID-19 or the flu. The app will collect &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/09/google-health-studies-apple/"&gt;demographic data&lt;/a&gt;, like age, gender, and race as well. “Researchers in this study can examine trends to understand the link between mobility (such as the number of daily trips a person makes outside the home) and the spread of COVID-19,” Google wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/google-health-studies-app/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvC55E"&gt;The app will send data to researchers using a technique called federated learning, which will batch aggregated trends from multiple devices, rather than pull information from each participant individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5nQAn"&gt;Health Studies is Google’s answer to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fresearch-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22165465%2Fgoogle-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Research app&lt;/a&gt;, which runs on iOS devices. Last year, it launched &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F11%2Fapple-launches-three-innovative-studies-today-in-the-new-research-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22165465%2Fgoogle-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on menstrual cycles, mobility and heart health, and hearing. Apple also lets researchers build their own iPhone apps through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/10/8177683/apple-research-kit-app-ethics-medical-research"&gt;ResearchKit program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dBE5B"&gt;Studies run through the app will come with the same caveats as research from other commercial wearable products: they can only enroll people who can purchase products like an Android phone. Aggregated data is a good way to protect privacy, but it means researchers aren’t able to take a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;granular look&lt;/a&gt; at information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afz4N1"&gt;Android phone users have a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-median-income-for-iphone-users-is-40-higher-than-that-of-android-users-2014-9"&gt;lower median income&lt;/a&gt; than iPhone users, which might be a benefit for Google Health Studies. “Android represents probably a more diverse dataset [than iPhone]. We’re pretty excited about the ability to leverage that,” John Brownstein, a chief innovation officer of Boston Children’s Hospital working on the study with Google, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/09/google-health-studies-apple/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
