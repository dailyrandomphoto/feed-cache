    <title>Uber and Lyft just scored a huge federal transportation contract</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qb0bLb"&gt;The US government awarded a big transportation contract to Uber and Lyft this week, authorizing the ride-hailing companies to provide transportation to up to 4 million federal employees and their families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji5dtp"&gt;The General Services Administration, the procurement arm for the federal government, granted the five-year contract to Uber and Lyft, the companies confirmed. The contract is worth up to $810 million, though it’s unclear how much each company will receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bOtwZ"&gt;While individual federal employees have previously been able to use ride-hail services for travel, the new contract allows the companies to formally launch their services within agencies and directly work with officials to promote the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wF6edy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a natural next step for us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VKtDi6"&gt;The contract was awarded to Uber for Business, the ride-hailing company’s business-to-business division. “The expansion of our customer base to include government is a natural next step for us, and we’re proud to help federal agencies tackle some of the biggest administrative challenges they face,” Ronnie Gurion, global head of Uber for Business, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfJlKJ"&gt;Lyft also hailed the contract as a good sign for the growth of its business. “Lyft already works closely with select agencies, but with this award under our belt, we see an opportunity to be the preferred rideshare partner for many other top federal agencies,” a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayEiFS"&gt;A spokesperson for GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a &lt;a href="https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2020/04/10/gsa-makes-travel-easier-and-cheaper-for-feds-when-they-rideshare"&gt;blog post back in April&lt;/a&gt;, the agency said it was able to negotiate a 2–4 percent discount with the companies, compared with large commercial customers. Uber and Lyft also agreed to waive technology fees charged to use back-office vendor data and reporting capabilities, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euDCTM"&gt;The contract with Uber and Lyft “modernizes official travel and will make it easier, and cheaper, to use rideshare services for official travel,” Federal Acquisition Service Assistant Commissioner for Travel, Transportation and Logistics Charlotte Phelan wrote. “No new apps to download - and no paper receipts to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xluwx5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches ambitious mission to bring back samples from the Moon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China To Launch Chang’e-5 Lunar Probe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veLa-7ingsRT1ctZtTePrrM-XdU=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867011/1287260578.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG / VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfWY3e"&gt;Today, China successfully launched its most ambitious mission to the Moon to date — this one designed to bring a handful of lunar rocks back to Earth before the end of the year. If successful, it’ll be the first time in nearly half a century that dirt from the Moon has been returned to Earth and the first time that China has retrieved materials from another world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edEFt2"&gt;The mission, called Chang’e 5, is the latest in a long line of lunar missions that China has been conducting over the last decade. In 2013, the country made its first soft landing on the Moon with Chang’e 3, making China just one of three nations to put a spacecraft on the lunar surface. Then in December 2018, China launched Chang’e 4 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18127180/china-national-space-administration-change-4-mission-lander-rover-far-side"&gt;successfully put a lander and rover on the far side of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019 — a feat that no other nation has accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FT0vSZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So far, only two nations have ever returned materials from the Moon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iy6tQB"&gt;Now with Chang’e 5, China plans to bring back samples of the Moon. So far, only two nations — the United States and the former Soviet Union — have ever returned materials from the Moon. Chang’e 5 could soon be next, and lessons learned from this mission could put the country on course for even more complex flights to the Moon in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAqqX7"&gt;“This is one thing that the Chinese space program is very good at,” Andrew Jones, a freelance reporter specializing in China’s space program, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They set incremental targets and goals, and they build on what they’ve achieved and make more ambitious targets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhMbGt"&gt;But first, a lot of things have to go right, and Chang’e 5 is perhaps the most complicated mission that China has ever launched. For one thing, the mission is fairly heavy, with all of the hardware needed for the roundtrip Moon flight weighing in at about 8.2 metric tons or around 18,000 pounds. To get Chang’e 5 en route to the Moon, China used its most powerful rocket, the Long March 5. The rocket took off from Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site located in south China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OY3tYU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vppYWohS67I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W9BWXy"&gt;The Long March 5 lofted a total of four robotic spacecraft for Chang’e 5, which will work together to bring back between 2 to 4 kilograms of lunar sample back to Earth, according to Jones. The quartet starts off its journey together, traveling to the Moon in a big pack. One of the four includes a service spacecraft that will help provide solar power and propel the group to the Moon. After entering the Moon’s orbit, two of the spacecraft — a lander and a vehicle to take off from the lander — will break away and descend to the surface. The lander will then use instruments to drill into the Moon, passing along the material it collects to the ascent vehicle sitting on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPxuWp"&gt;That ascent vehicle will then act as a mini-rocket, taking off from the Moon and meeting up with the hardware still in lunar orbit. Once it docks with the service spacecraft, the lunar sample will pass into the fourth spacecraft — a capsule designed to land back on Earth. The trio will then leave lunar orbit and head back to Earth. Eventually, the return capsule will break away with its precious materials inside. Since it will be coming in so fast from the Moon, the capsule will actually bounce off the Earth’s atmosphere once before diving toward the planet and eventually landing in Inner Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1GBKd2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It should be a quick mission, lasting just 23 days or so&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jsCjIE"&gt;All in all, it should be a quick mission, lasting just 23 days or so from launch to landing of the lunar material, Jones says. That’s because Chang’e 5 is not designed to survive the harsh lunar night, a two-week period that occurs every month when part of the Moon’s surface is plunged into darkness and &lt;a href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/lithos/LROlitho7temperaturevariation27May2014.pdf"&gt;temperatures can drop well below -208 degrees Fahrenheit (-130 degrees Celsius)&lt;/a&gt;. To survive such an extreme environment, the surface spacecraft would need to be equipped with special heating instruments — such as radioisotope generators that radioactively decay over time and generate warmth. Previous Chang’e missions included these generators to survive the lunar night, but such materials are missing on Chang’e 5 since this is designed to be a quick “grab and go” mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpTMtC"&gt;That means in less than a month, China could bring back the first samples of the Moon returned to Earth since the Cold War era. US astronauts famously brought back lunar rocks collected during the Apollo missions in the 1960s and ’70s, while the former Soviet Union performed a handful of successful lunar sample return missions in the 1970s. In fact, the last time lunar rocks came back to Earth occurred in 1976 with the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 robotic probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTfap8"&gt;Chang’e 5 is targeting a particularly enticing part of the Moon called Oceanus Procellarum. This unexplored area has relatively few craters on its surface compared to other parts of the Moon. One theory is that volcanic activity may have occurred in this area late in the Moon’s life, smoothing away craters that were there before. Getting samples from this region could provide scientists with a better understanding of when this volcanic activity might have occurred, providing a better snapshot of how the Moon formed and evolved over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yi3dLH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The complexity of Chang’e 5 is also a deliberate choice for China&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rnEI6q"&gt;“It’s a big deal for the science community in China, and also the data will be keenly followed by scientists internationally,” Jones says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQRcTx"&gt;The complexity of Chang’e 5 is also a deliberate choice for China, according to Jones, as it will allow the country to test out how to rendezvous and dock spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. China could have opted for the ascent vehicle to take the lunar samples all the way back to Earth. But Jones notes that the meetup in lunar orbit is meant to test out capabilities needed on future missions. A mission designed to return samples from Mars could certainly draw from Chang’e 5. But it’s also important to note that this mission is very similar in its flight profile to that of NASA’s Apollo missions, which used similar techniques for putting people on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX2o2X"&gt;“This is much more of an Apollo kind of mission profile than it was for the Soviet robotic lunar sample return,” says Jones. “So the idea is that they’re playing out and practicing for future crewed missions to the Moon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple head of security accused of offering iPads as bribes for concealed gun permits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad 5 sonny dickinson" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IgD5ED1mBhH3f-YTSdBRBRl-aqk=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866809/ipad5sonny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvXHac"&gt;A California grand jury has &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Documents/2020NRDocs/CCW%20Indictments%20-%20Sung.pdf"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s head of global security on charges that he tried to bribe Santa Clara County officials to procure firearms (CCW) licenses, &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/NRA2020/CCW-Undersheriff-Sung-.aspx"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen alleges that Thomas Moyer offered 200 iPads — worth about $70,000 — to Capt. James Jensen and Undersheriff Rick Sung in the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office, in exchange for four concealed firearms licenses for Apple employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWyVgE"&gt;The charges came after a two-year investigation. “In the case of four CCW licenses withheld from Apple employees, Undersheriff Sung and Cpt. Jensen managed to extract from Thomas Moyer a promise that Apple would donate iPads to the Sheriff’s Office,” Rosen said in the news release. The iPads were never delivered, according to Rosen’s office, because Sung and Moyer became aware in 2019 that the district attorney was executing a search warrant for the sheriff department’s CCW records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRwiKj"&gt;Moyer’s attorney, Ed Swanson, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his client is innocent of the charges filed against him, adding he believed Moyer was “collateral damage” in a dispute between the Santa Clara sheriff and district attorneys’ offices. “He did nothing wrong and has acted with the highest integrity throughout his career,” Swanson said. “We have no doubt he will be acquitted at trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdF7Lw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/apple-security-chief-accused-of-offering-to-bribe-officials"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Moyer has been at Apple for about 15 years and has been its head of global security since November 2018. He wrote a memo in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;warning Apple employees&lt;/a&gt; about the potential consequences of leaking information to the media, which he wrote “can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2aXB6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM abandons Trump’s war against California’s pollution powers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-TRUMP-AUTO INDUSTRY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cVZWP9BZTODJTDrInp7xr810Z6g=/0x74:3140x2167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866755/632572776.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;US President Donald Trump speaks with General Motors CEO Mary Barra during a meeting with automobile industry leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC on January 24th, 2017.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JeeL76"&gt;General Motors announced today that it is abandoning Donald Trump’s effort to take away California’s ability to set fuel efficiency standards. The company, along with Fiat Chrysler and Toyota, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;previously backed Trump’s efforts&lt;/a&gt; to roll back fuel efficiency standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3U1FS"&gt;Under the Clean Air Act, California has historically been allowed to set its own emissions standards, which are tougher than federal guidelines and typically set the bar for the entire auto industry in the US. California is the largest auto market in the US and the 10th largest in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bhwjrd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are immediately withdrawing from the pre-emption litigation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XfLWq"&gt;GM is now aligning itself with President-elect Joe Biden’s plans to hasten a transition to electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXYmds"&gt;“We are confident that the Biden Administration, California, and the U.S. auto industry, which supports 10.3 million jobs, can collaboratively find the pathway that will deliver an all-electric future,” GM CEO Mary Barra wrote in a letter to environmental groups today that was shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “To better foster the necessary dialogue, we are immediately withdrawing from the pre-emption litigation and inviting other automakers to join us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvfDUI"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;GM pledged&lt;/a&gt; to boost spending on the development of its electric vehicles. The company said that it would launch 30 new electric vehicles by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnaJGq"&gt;In March 2020, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;rolled back&lt;/a&gt; an Obama-era plan to put more fuel-efficient vehicles on the roads. Nearly two dozen states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration in response. Even other car companies balked at the administration’s attempt to roll back the fuel efficiency mandate. While GM and a few others supported Trump, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;sided with California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends deadline for requiring in-app purchases for apps selling online classes and events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41Td2Civs3RZATncjC73iWzRr-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866441/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sls9lL"&gt;Apple on Monday announced &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=kw16tplo"&gt;an extension to its deadline&lt;/a&gt; for requiring in-app purchases for online events and classes offered within iOS apps to June 30th, 2021. Apple previously adjusted what types of events are subject to its in-app purchase policy and standard 30 percent cut back in September, with the original intention of requiring in-app purchases in all appropriate apps by December of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOgA4k"&gt;Apple cited the coronavirus pandemic, writing in a developer update posted to its website, “As the world fights COVID-19, we recognize that adapting experiences from in-person to digital continues to be a top priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y0dPqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XVXsTi"&gt;Requiring in-app purchase options for outside services like video streaming and exercise classes offered through iOS has been part of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;the company’s policy&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while, but this specific change is focused on the adjustments made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455598/facebook-paid-events-apple-ios-30-percent-fees-waived"&gt;following Facebook’s September complaint&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s issue was framed around event organizers losing out on much-needed money for their digital events offered through the Facebook app during COVID-19, because of Apple’s 30 percent in-app purchase commission. Apple decided to waive the fee till the end of the year, and the company adjusted its policy to focus on group events and classes to keep one-on-one experiences free from Apple fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vcUBs"&gt;This deadline extension means developers have more time to incorporate in-app purchases in their apps where applicable and to temporarily reap the full profits of their sales. Apple’s other recent App Store changes suggest it’s inclined to make some concessions, whether because of pressure from developers or regulatory scrutiny from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;on-going legal battle with Epic&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;anti-trust investigation in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLdR73"&gt;The best example is Apple’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;. Any developer making under $1 million in sales per year will be able to apply next year and if approved receive a reduced 15 percent App Store commission. Other companies like Amazon have negotiated such exemptions, albeit in back room deals rather than public battles. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;Amazon Prime Video is able to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a reduced 15 percent Apple commission and sell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;in-app purchases and rentals&lt;/a&gt; without being forced to use Apple’s in-app purchase option. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Disney team up for a Mandalorian AR experience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tgLkpM-pWqM9nMp6zrVSAWuEeLg=/64x0:736x448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866240/The_Mandalorian_AR_Experience.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian just jetpacked into your living room&lt;/em&gt; | Google/Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HDBXJf"&gt;Google and Disney have teamed up for a new AR experience featuring &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/705878/9358?sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt; and yes, Baby Yoda is involved. The Mandalorian AR experience “puts you in the shoes of a bounty hunter following the trail of Mando himself, Din Djarin, and The Child,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/mandalorian-in-ar/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Matthieu Lorrain, head of creative, AR partnerships at Google. Players can interact with the characters in AR and capture scenes from the app for sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qLnhNi_tYBrfU7-x_KQsBklAYY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22070312/The_Mandalorian_AR_Experience_BTS.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google/Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian is scanning your kitchen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="siY2FV"&gt;The app is built on ARCore, Google’s developer platform for building augmented reality experiences, and uses its&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/20999646/google-arcore-augmented-reality-updates-occlusion-physics-depth"&gt; ARCore Depth API, which enables occlusion&lt;/a&gt; — when an AR object is blocked from view by other real objects in a scene (handy if the Mandalorian jetpacks in and your cat strolls into the scene).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wq0sJu"&gt;Google worked with Disney and Lucasfilm to build models and animations based mostly on the hit Disney Plus show’s first season. New episodes of the experience will come to the app weekly, however, so it’s likely Season 2 will soon be part of the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2h1Ky"&gt;One big caveat: while you don’t need a 5G connection to use the app, The Mandalorian AR experience is only supported on compatible 5G Android devices (check out the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/mandalorian"&gt;full list here&lt;/a&gt;) that have the Google Play Services for AR feature. Google says it may come to more Android devices soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj9Nga"&gt;This isn’t the first time Google has created a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-themed AR experience; back in 2017, it introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16762638/pixel-augmented-reality-stickers-google-launch"&gt;AR Stickers for the Pixel 2&lt;/a&gt;, which featured stormtroopers, R2-D2, BB-8, and porgs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zleHj"&gt;&lt;a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian"&gt;The Mandalorian AR Experience&lt;/a&gt; is available as a free download on the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Black Friday deals happening at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NB7woJ14IRLt5yWX3wFP1Cv9daw=/0x56:2529x1742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866162/VizioOLED.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 55-inch Vizio OLED TV is $900 at Best Buy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvCD0L"&gt;Best Buy was one of the first retailers to launch Black Friday deals — all the way back in mid-October to go up against Amazon Prime Day. Now that Black Friday is actually here, Best Buy is back with a bunch of great sales that you can take advantage of. Best Buy stores around the US will be closed all of Thanksgiving, but if you want to shop in-person, most will re-open at 5AM local time on Black Friday. Alternatively, just stay home and do your shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7NDsp"&gt;Below, you’ll find the best deals currently happening at Best Buy. If you want to find out what’s happening at other retailers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;check out our other Black Friday coverage&lt;/a&gt;. As new deals come out, we’ll add those to the top so you can see them easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7vnPIf"&gt;TVs and home entertainment deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eIZha9"&gt;Best Buy is currently hosting better deals on TVs than any other retailer, particularly those that would be a great purchase alongside a PS5 or Xbox Series X. For instance, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588595468253653" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has the Vizio 55-inch OLED starting at $900&lt;/a&gt;, which is a great price for a TV with an OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ODAL1e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9549851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vCC6nf"&gt;If you’re signed in to a My Best Buy account (it’s free to join, only requiring an email address), you can get &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588556343644777" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra $50 off an already great price of $1,400 on LG’s CX OLED TV&lt;/a&gt;. Normally around $1,700 (and not currently available on Amazon), this TV is a great deal at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zZwE0T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9549578"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung 70-inch 4K TV" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twUYMbSMEPv0V06Bpk5kVhBv-Xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21996472/samsung70inch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want a big TV without spending handsomely for one, this 70-inch model costs $530.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="pWaaxO"&gt;Best Buy has also been the exclusive retailer to offer this deal on a 70-inch Samsung 4K TV, pictured above. If you want a huge TV for far less than $1K, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588707227974343" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;snag this one right now for just $530&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XWUmDo"&gt;If 70 inches is small potatoes to you, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724589095308582019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; 86-inch UN8500 4K LED TV is $1,450&lt;/a&gt; with a My Best Buy account. Without being signed in, it’s $1,500. Normally, this model sells for $1,900.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEOFr5"&gt;Alternatively, if you’re on a budget, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724589729163726070" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Toshiba’s 50-inch 4K TV with Fire TV software built in&lt;/a&gt; costs just $260, down from $380.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724590174029795626" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ Beam soundbar&lt;/a&gt; is $299 (usually $399). We’ve seen this deal before, but it’s been a little while since the last time it hit. To sweeten the deal compared to what other retailers are offering, Best Buy includes a $10 gift card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6VLZAD"&gt;If you want a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724590263850071182" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub wireless subwoofer&lt;/a&gt; to go with it, those are $599 (usually $699). &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eVGzdK"&gt;If you’re looking to upgrade your phone on Verizon, Best Buy is offering the best deal we’ve seen yet on the Google Pixel 5. Normally $700, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724593881008180222" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can activate it with a one-time payment for $500&lt;/a&gt; on Verizon’s service (it’s locked to the carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759602/verizon-60-day-phone-lock-fcc-approves#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Communications%20Commission%20has,a%20period%20of%2060%20days.&amp;amp;text=%E2%80%9CAfter%20the%2060%20day%20period,executive%20vice%20president%20at%20Verizon."&gt;for 60 days&lt;/a&gt;, after which you can use it with other carriers if you choose to). Alternatively, you can pay $20.83 monthly, which totals to the same $500 cost. Unfortunately, Best Buy is currently sold out of the “sorta sage” colorway pictured above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5FyBT9"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724600983932958943" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G&lt;/a&gt; is $549. This phone usually costs $699, and before this, it hadn’t dropped in price lower than $600.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 5’s always-on display might make it a more appealing buy than the Apple Watch SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="E190PO"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724594222286931898" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 5 (GPS, 40mm)&lt;/a&gt; is $299 (normally $399). This discontinued model has been tough to find, and if you want it, Best Buy currently sells just a few color configurations for this price. The cheaper Apple Watch SE is a very similar smartwatch internally, but the Series 5 still stands out with its always-on display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gGyKcG"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724592087927112087" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s high-end Sense smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; that can detect your skin’s temperature, perform an EKG, and more is $280 (usually $330)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fE9GhM"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724592116938634565" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s Versa 3 smartwatch with built-in GPS&lt;/a&gt; is $30 off, down to $200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v9EBTo"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724592132336246232" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Fitbit Inspire 2 fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt; is $69 (usually $100)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xs8J30"&gt;One of the best deals on headphones happening exclusively at Best Buy is on &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724594794872804417" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;either the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus or Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. Both are down to nearly the lowest prices we’ve seen, but what makes them especially good is that you’ll get a $20 Best Buy gift card with either model. One note: you just must buy them in the blue colorway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c9noE3"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724594724985940102" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II wireless, noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; are $200 (usually $350).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Guz7G"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724594753463223451" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless, noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; are back down to $278, a $72 price cut that we’ve seen a few times this autumn season already.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LOCuxJ"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="sFtw50"&gt;Google’s Nest Wifi mesh routers are steeply discounted, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724592195825667221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting with the single unit&lt;/a&gt; that’s $139 instead of $169&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rxFyWM"&gt;You’ll save even more &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724592272908055343" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;if you buy two Google Nest Wifi routers&lt;/a&gt;, priced together for $219 (usually $299)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="6PhEkQ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724599503003361787" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The new Eero 6 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi router&lt;/a&gt; is $103 (usually $130)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="69dry2"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724599524552500261" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;If you want a two-pack of the dual-band Eero Pro 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll cost $159 (usually $200)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n9KSZt"&gt;For a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724599600863769919" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of the tri-band Eero Pro 6 routers&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll pay $479 instead of $600&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo speaker looks like a ball.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X91BdW"&gt;You should know that most of these deals below, except for the price cuts on the Google Home and Nest Hub products, are available on Amazon as well. That’s a general rule of thumb for Amazon-made devices: they’re generally available at Best Buy and usually for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rICTK9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724597961289097371" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest Amazon Echo smart speaker that has a spherical design&lt;/a&gt; and better sound than the previous generation is $70 (usually $100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kX6U64"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598030655023895" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The smaller Echo Dot that has the same design as the more expensive Echo&lt;/a&gt; is just $29 (usually $50)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tqFtlZ"&gt;If you want &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598048648596021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the new Echo Dot with a digital clock embedded in the fabric&lt;/a&gt;, that one costs $39. It’s normally $60.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7KWZwX"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598105483067987" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The new (and adorable) Kids Edition Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt; with the tiger design is $39. It normally costs $60&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s0MMMy"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598137873453707" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;, the best-sounding Echo speaker, is down to $160 (usually $200)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9pPDEg"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598222144111574" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Sonos Move Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; is $300 (usually $400)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JFybR5"&gt;Smart display deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zu068GURzFQxd3NdVrFIzleSr9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16389070/dseifert_190620_3500_5265.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 and Echo Show 8 have the same features. It’s just the size of the display that differs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="67oUHd"&gt;It’s the same deal here concerning Best Buy matching Amazon’s prices, as maybe you’ve seen above with smart speakers and Eero mesh Wi-Fi routers, and below with the smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bfrAso"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598566241509635" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Amazon Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; smart display with a camera is down to $45 (usually $90). This matches the best price debuted during Prime Day 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AD9yUz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The slightly larger Echo &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598686700662281" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724600832392977997" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how 8&lt;/a&gt; with a bigger screen and more powerful speakers is $65 (usually $130)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eWS2e7"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598776113508288" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook’s Portal TV&lt;/a&gt; brings video chatting through Facebook to your TV for $129 (usually $149)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6uFsWv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724600808382489100" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Facebook Portal 10-inch display&lt;/a&gt; is $129, dropping in price from $179. It’s most like the Amazon smart displays mentioned above, but this one definitely looks more like a picture frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="16NdfD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598909817313228" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal Mini&lt;/a&gt; is a smaller version that costs $65 (usually $129)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lygFUi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724599095392513686" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal Plus&lt;/a&gt; is $229 (usually $280). This smart display can pan and zoom to follow you around if you move during a video call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724594273326680131" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Google Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt;, a larger smart display that does feature a camera, is $180 (usually $230)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="rPe8fl"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724600603392983142" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The base Ring Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; costs $70 (usually $100)&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZW8E5CtbikxomB2PeRzNbACsFmk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67798744/dseifert_201020_4247_0006.0.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kq7sS1"&gt;Smart speaker and audio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRx7v2iKWDhr2lI1LUX0smT9vN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208402/dseifert_190915_3647_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sono’s portable Move speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3TO80R"&gt;Sonos has slashed the prices on several of its speakers ahead of Black Friday. Three of its popular models are $100 off right now, a savings of up to 25 percent. You can buy the Sonos Move, the company’s first portable speaker, for just $299 right now at Sonos and Amazon or $300 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="APQVzv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tWOj2e"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D4734HR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Beam is $299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (Usually $400). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/move.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great entry-level soundbar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sNyRnl"&gt;You can also buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087CCZH4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub add-on speaker at a discounted price for $599 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (usually $700). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIQou8"&gt;If you’re looking for a compact and inexpensive smart speaker, both of the latest Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices are on sale. The 4th Gen Echo Dot is down to $29, which is the lowest price we’ve seen since its launch this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJS3T7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rkA3Fv"&gt;The Echo Dot’s compact design might not be appealing to everyone, but if you are looking for an Echo Device but want something a bit bigger, you can grab the Amazon Echo’s fourth-generation speaker for $70 right now at a few retailers, including Amazon and Target. Like this year’s Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo has an updated design that makes it more spherical in shape. It also has much improved audio quality and the ability to connect Zigbee smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8yyuQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1n5zT"&gt;Over at Adorama and Best Buy, you can buy a Google Nest Audio two-pack for $169 right now. A two-pack for this smart speaker would normally set you back $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U1SnqO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is the lowest we’ve seen yet on Apple’s flagship earbuds. Compared to the standard AirPods, the Pro model features better sound quality and noise cancellation, plus support for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="AhnjK1"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds are down to just $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best price we’ve seen for this model, which usually costs $150 outside of any discounts. Compared to the standard Galaxy Buds, this upgraded model that launched alongside the Galaxy S20 series of phones has improved sound quality, microphones, and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5zWQ0"&gt;If you are looking to buy two pairs of Galaxy Buds Plus, Best Buy has a few bundles, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213386876980609" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;allowing you to buy sets for only $200&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="ArxGby"&gt;Alongside the Plus wireless earbuds, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds are discounted at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally, these earbuds would cost $130, but you can get them for $70 at either retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttnzGj"&gt;Unfortunately, the color options are limited at both retailers, so you can only buy these earbuds in either black or silver. &lt;/p&gt;

This model includes an 11-inch display and a 128GB storage configuration. If 128GB is not enough storage space for you, both retailers are taking $100 off the 256GB configuration, bringing the price down to $800, which is what you would normally pay if you bought the entry-level 11-inch iPad Pro with the lowest storage configuration. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SyzhPO"&gt;If you like Fitbit’s wearables and prefer to have a smartwatch by the company, you can get the Fitbit Sense smartwatch for $280 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s website&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724580973739712242" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1590667-REG%2Ffitbit_fb512bkbk_sense_gps_smartwatch_carbon.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this model costs $330 and allows you to track your stress levels and measure your blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAW1Mh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlkbsX"&gt;The Apple Watch SE was already the most affordable Watch that Apple made at $279, but it’s even cheaper at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578867741826427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can score the 40mm GPS version for $259 or the larger 44mm Watch for $289 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=e39bfa3f763e4fa56204c59a62303c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578918898824263" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Each size looks similar to the more expensive Series 6 but lacks the always-on display and a few other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Widfy"&gt;The Apple Watch SE aligns more with the Series 5 in terms of specs, but at $259, it’s a fantastic value. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;Here’s an in-depth post&lt;/a&gt; on how the SE differs from other recent Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Ffa5rt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6 is also cheaper than usual at Amazon and Walmart. Normally $400 for the 40mm GPS model, it’s down to $330 — but there’s a catch. You must buy this model in either red or blue at Amazon and Walmart only has the red model in this size discounted right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Wifi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="65HtKg"&gt;If you have a large home and want to make sure all of the rooms in it have internet and no dead zones, Amazon and Best Buy has discounted the Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi router. You can get three units for just $479. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jg0NxI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kPHL"&gt;Ahead of Black Friday, Google has discounted several of its products, including the Nest Wifi, and you can buy a two-pack for $219. The Nest Wifi system is easy to set up, and with two units, you can cover up to 4,400 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RtDGBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwgnwv"&gt;If you need a mesh router system that will cover more square feet in your home, you can buy a three-pack Eero 6 mesh router for $223. The mesh routers also include a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, allowing you to connect and control select devices with Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dACyX2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Av0Zih"&gt;If you prefer Netgear products, you can save 22 percent on a two-pack for the company’s Nighthawk mesh router system. It’s designed for homes that have up to 400Mbps of internet speeds. Netgear says its Nighthawk mesh router system provides up to 3,000 square feet in coverage and support for 25 or more devices.&lt;/p&gt;

Normally $290, this kit will only cost you $150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WM5ndj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp4b3f"&gt;Circling back to Netgear, its $450 flagship mesh router system is also discounted. You can buy the Orbi RBK752 Wi-Fi 6 mesh router system for $280 at Amazon or Best Buy right now. This is a great product if you need something that will have the bandwidth to stream multiple videos in 4K or 8K resolution in your house. &lt;/p&gt;

It features optional password protection with AES 256-bit encryption and Samsung claims the T7 has up to 1,050MB/s transfer speeds. It’s compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Windows 10, macOS, and Android. Unfortunately, it will not work on iPad or iOS devices and it is not compatible as an external SSD for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. &lt;/p&gt;

What makes this deal even better is that each version will net you an upgrade to the Xbox Series X / S or PS5 copies for free. Even if you don’t have much interest in the game, it’s an affordable way to check out what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556197/xbox-series-s-ray-tracing-watch-dogs-legion"&gt;impressive ray-tracing graphics&lt;/a&gt; look like on the new console hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5Oyb4M"&gt;If you’re having trouble narrowing down what games you want, why not get several? &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fvideo-game-software%2F-%2FN-fhju6%3FNao%3D0&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target is hosting a “get three for the price of two”&lt;/a&gt; deal on video game purchases — even for newer titles like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, to name a few. The list goes on, though one thing that isn’t eligible are first-party Sony games for the PS5, like the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;remake, but you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Godfall, &lt;/em&gt;which is available on Sony’s next-gen console (and on PC.) Even &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; a game coming out next month is eligible for this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image shows the 1TB model, but the 2TB model detailed below looks the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ekCZCJ"&gt;If you want 2TB of fast storage for your PC, Samsung’s 2TB 970 Evo Plus NVMe SSD is $250 at Newegg and Amazon, beating the lowest price by about $40. Over the summer, the price was steady at $350. A PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD like this will fit in only certain kinds of motherboards (so check before you buy). Alternatively, it can also make for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18518127/portable-ssd-external-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-samsung-x5-t5-specs-test-how-to"&gt;very fast USB-C drive&lt;/a&gt; if you get an M.2 enclosure for it. Either route you take, you’ll get a lot of speedy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve McQueen’s film series Small Axe is an intimate experience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4FA1tZWRhAibnnugkZbIPhPtk3M=/141x66:1299x838/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67852907/Screen_Shot_2020_11_23_at_1.25.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i2PBHE"&gt;Steve McQueen’s &lt;em&gt;Widows&lt;/em&gt; was one of the best movies to come out in 2018: it was a smart, slick crime thriller that showed the acclaimed filmmaker could follow up a challenging drama like &lt;em&gt;Shame&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;12 Years a Slave &lt;/em&gt;with tremendous crowd-pleasers. Two years later, he’s back with his follow-up effort: &lt;em&gt;Small Axe&lt;/em&gt;, which is &lt;em&gt;five whole movies&lt;/em&gt; now streaming on Amazon Prime. We knew McQueen was good, and now it’s undeniable that he has the range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IALxQI"&gt;While it presents as a TV series — and that’s how the BBC is airing it across the pond — it’s best to think of &lt;em&gt;Small Axe &lt;/em&gt;as five full-on movies, with a new one premiering every Friday. (My suggestion: watch it right after &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian.&lt;/em&gt;) Each film / episode features an entirely new story with a different cast every time — and each feels rich enough to live in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7S6hQ"&gt;The first three installments have been made available to critics. &lt;em&gt;Mangrove&lt;/em&gt; recounts the true story of Frank Crichlow (played by Shaun Parkes), who was the proprietor of Notting Hill’s Mangrove restaurant as it was targeted by the police. Under the authorities’ constant pressure, a resistance movement is born, and the Mangrove becomes a hub for activism. The second half of the film transforms into a legal drama as Crichlow and his associates take on the corrupt police. The second film, &lt;em&gt;Lovers Rock&lt;/em&gt;, is an ode to house parties and the slow-jam Reggae subgenre it’s named after. On the other hand, the third, &lt;em&gt;Red, White, and Blue&lt;/em&gt;, stars John Boyega as a man who decides to join the police force in an attempt to reform it from within after his father is assaulted by cops. (His efforts are largely in vain.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZJDel"&gt;Though the scope of &lt;em&gt;Small Axe &lt;/em&gt;seems large, each film is defined by its moments of intimacy. In &lt;em&gt;Mangrove&lt;/em&gt;, it’s an impassioned conversation in the restaurant’s dining room after hours, as Frank Crichlow becomes convinced that he needs to take his grievances to the streets. In &lt;em&gt;Lovers Rock&lt;/em&gt; — the series highlight — there’s an extended sequence where a single song washes over the dance floor and threads everyone together, transforming a room full of individuals into a single rhythmic organ. &lt;em&gt;Red, White, and Blue&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, shows the warmth of Leroy Logan’s (Boyega) encounter with an old acquaintance while in uniform. It’s a moment of community Logan longs for and never quite manages to find again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8KqFrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each film is defined by its moments of intimacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ohhv4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small Axe &lt;/em&gt;is a prism, each film its own vibrant hue worth appreciating on its own, yet collectively illuminating one specific experience, the ways in which British Black folks formed neighborhoods and purpose and asserted their humanity in the face of white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMlFyF"&gt;These are stories of community and about how those communities are intentional. They’re built through food, organizing, and protest; they’re sustained with music and dance. &lt;em&gt;Small Axe &lt;/em&gt;takes its name from a Bob Marley line: “If you are the big tree, we are the small axe, ready to cut you down.” In McQueen’s telling, people push back against the institutional forces that would keep them oppressed. And through his eyes, we see the axe do its necessary work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is it so hard to turn off the PS5? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6X2Ovq90jjv8Bt3siWkWLh8vZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67852002/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C2L0zZ"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation 5 user interface could really use some work, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the simple act of trying to turn the thing off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NiRIR"&gt;On most recent consoles, it’s been pretty easy to shut down the device with just the controller. Simply press and hold the PS button / Xbox button / home button, and the UI will helpfully show you an option to power down the console in some way. This is true for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It takes just a few seconds, and I can happily end a gaming session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDrj2E"&gt;But turning off the PS5, for no good reason that I can figure out, is a needlessly cumbersome process. Instead, when I press and hold the PS button — the behavior I have used for years to start the process — I’m taken back to the main PS5 menu where I’m presented with options like picking a different game to play, checking out the PlayStation Store, or opening a media app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1XDfD"&gt;Instead, Sony has buried the option to turn off the console in the quick actions menu that appears with a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; tap of the PS button instead of a press and hold. But even when I pull that menu up, I have to spend a few seconds navigating to the unlabeled icon representing power (you probably know the one — the circle with the vertical line through the top) and opening it up. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; I see the options to shut down my PS5. You can also shut down the console after logging out from your account, but that’s not exactly a speedy option, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vi3J1J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Xbox Series X, by comparison, is very easy to turn off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcXLug"&gt;The Xbox Series X, by comparison, is very easy to turn off. You just press and hold the Xbox button, and on the menu that appears, tap up and select if you’d like to turn off the console or controller or restart the console. Shutting down the Switch is even easier: press and hold the home button, and the menu that appears already has the sleep mode option selected, requiring just one more button press to turn the system off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahfpl"&gt;Turning off the PS5 is just one of many other frustrating issues I’ve experienced with the console’s UI. The way trophies are displayed is a step backward, for example. Instead of a vertically scrolling list, PS5 trophies are shown as a long, horizontal row of large cards. It’s harder to quickly browse through them, and they show less information at a glance. One of my colleagues has taken to checking her trophies using the PlayStation mobile app, which has... a vertically scrolling list, just like it remains on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlJjjF"&gt;Taking screenshots and captures off the console is also a pain, especially compared to the Xbox Series X. On the Series X, screenshots and captures are automatically synced to the Xbox mobile app, where I can save them to my phone. But on PS5, the only way to share captured media is by uploading it to another platform directly from the PS5 or transferring it to a USB drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q18Ity"&gt;And sometimes, when I boot up the PS5 to jump into another hellish play session with &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, the console opens not the game I was playing last but instead the Explore menu, which shows news and trailers about games. Right now, it’s showing me a card for an upcoming map in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, a game that I don’t own and don’t want to play. To actually jump into the game I was playing before I turned the console off and the reason I’m waking it up again, I have to navigate one-directional tap over to the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; icon. It’s a small inconvenience but just one of many problems that make for a frustrating experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPL4Ph"&gt;I do like the PS5 a lot. Sony hyped up the console’s ultra-fast SSD for months, and it’s been a revelation to jump from world to world in &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; with hardly any wait time. But that ethos of speed doesn’t seem to be applied to the day-to-day moments of using the console’s UI, and I really hope that Sony updates it soon to make things a bit more seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNhXuc"&gt;But until then, you can listen for me cursing under my breath when I forget, yet again, that it’s a short press to get to the power menu, not a long one. &lt;/p&gt;
