    <title>A robotic spacecraft just latched onto an active satellite in orbit</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4Fk6e"&gt;A robotic spacecraft from Northrop Grumman latched onto an old communications satellite in deep orbit and extended its lifespan by five more years. The Mission Extension Vehicle-2 (MEV-2) marked Northrop’s second successful docking of an object in space. The mission is part of the company’s efforts to kickstart an industry of life-extension services for dead, dying or errant satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0qCZW"&gt;MEV-2 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21366674/northrop-grumman-space-logistics-mev-2-satellite-servicing-life-extension"&gt;launched in August last year&lt;/a&gt; from French Guiana in South America. It spent six months raising its orbit to rendezvous with Intelsat’s 17-year-old communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit, more than 22,000 miles from Earth. That satellite was running out of fuel and was getting old; it had operated far beyond its expected lifespan while still providing broadband communications to three continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjKNew"&gt;On March 12th, the MEV-2 craft started a month-long docking process with the Intelsat satellite. Docking was completed and confirmed successful by Northrop Grumman today at 1:34PM ET. It “was every bit as exciting and successful as the docking of MEV-1,” Joe Anderson, vice president of business development at SpaceLogistics, the Northrop subsidiary that launches MEVs, said during a press conference on Monday. Now, Intelsat’s IS-10-02 satellite can carry on beaming broadband communications to South America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="N2zgDU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154426/commercial-satellites-docking-space-northrop-grumman-intelsat"&gt;MEV-1 was Northrop’s first docking success&lt;/a&gt; last year, a breakthrough in its goal to spruce up dead or dying satellites and save satellite operators the cost of replacing them altogether. Extending the lifetime of satellites also helps tamp down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20991798/space-debris-low-earth-orbit-satellites-mega-constellations-collisions-graph"&gt;space junk&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17906158/nasa-spacex-oneweb-satellite-large-constellations-orbital-debris"&gt;growing problem&lt;/a&gt; in orbit as the world launches record amounts of satellites to space each year. De-orbiting a satellite from geosynchronous orbit could take decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYZDgQ"&gt;The Northrop-Intelsat servicing contract was a “win-win situation,” said Jean-Luc Froeliger, a vice president at Intelsat, during a press conference on Monday. The IS-10-02 satellite was performing well, Froeliger said, but without Northrop’s MEV-2, they would’ve had to deorbit it because it was running low on fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhMjHa"&gt;MEV-2 is currently clamped to the back of IS-10-02, serving as the satellite’s life support by providing renewed power and navigation control. The two will operate as a “combined stack” for the next five years. After that, MEV-2 will undock from IS-10-02 and set off to rendezvous with another client satellite. It’s unclear how long IS-10-02 will survive in orbit after MEV leaves to service other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XC05l"&gt;Northrop is also building an upgraded satellite servicing system called a Mission Robotic Vehicle (or MRV). That spacecraft will meet up with aging satellites to install orbital first-aid kits called Mission Extension Pods, designed to provide propulsion and power. Each MRV can carry six pods. MRV’s debut launch is slated for early 2024, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is removing its Play Movies and TV app from every Roku and most smart TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A warning message about the changeover to YouTube on an LG Smart TV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JwVA2CymoFgnNxRYMT0b0TmSwQg=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115989/IMG_1181.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDOt7M"&gt;The Google Play Movies and TV app will no longer be available on any Roku set-top box or any Samsung, LG, Vizio or Roku smart TV starting July 15th, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/102498448?hl=en"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/12/google-play-movies-roku-samsung-lg-vizio/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you have movies or TV shows purchased or rented through the service, you’ll still be able to access them through the “Your movies and shows” section of the YouTube app on those devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSkCjI"&gt;This change will also affect you if if you used the Movies and TV app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/13/16464000/how-to-use-movies-anywhere-app-features"&gt;to access Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, the service that allows you to redeem codes from DVDs and Blu-rays so you can access your media digitally. Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that users who relied on Play Movies and TV to access that content will be able to do so through YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phbyYj"&gt;There are a few other caveats to note in the transition to YouTube. Your Watchlist will no longer be viewable in the app (though it can still be seen on the web by &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=my%20watchlist"&gt;Googling “my watchlist”&lt;/a&gt;), and while your family can still share the content you bought from the Movie and TV store, any purchases made in the YouTube app won’t be shared with your family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsSFks"&gt;If you have movies or TV content purchased through the Play Store, here’s how you’ll be able to access them after July 15th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8GHnkC"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Android phones/tablets: &lt;/strong&gt;using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21492549/google-tv-app-play-movies-name-change-chromecast"&gt;the Google TV app&lt;/a&gt; or the YouTube app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nXvYjF"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On iPhones/iPads:&lt;/strong&gt; using the Google Play Movies and TV app, or the YouTube App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JMy9en"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Roku devices: &lt;/strong&gt;using the YouTube app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="re2aJ5"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Samsung, LG, Vizio, and Roku smart TVs:&lt;/strong&gt; using the YouTube app &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Fkiq6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Chromecast:&lt;/strong&gt; using the Google TV app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bglTXt"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On the web: &lt;/strong&gt;using the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/movies"&gt;Google Play Movies and TV website&lt;/a&gt; or YouTube website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6c1Vsf"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;On Android TV: &lt;/strong&gt;using the Google Play Movies and TV&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;app (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/androidtv/answer/6111147?hl=en"&gt;according to Google’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4L4h1l"&gt;To view your content on YouTube, log in, go to Library, then tap “Your movies and shows.” There, you’ll see your Google Play Store movie and TV purchases, your Movies Anywhere content, and any content purchased from within the YouTube app itself (with the family sharing caveat noted above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFx7S4"&gt;Transitioning from one app to another can be tough, but Google is hoping to take some of the sting away for users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liliputingnews/status/1381704020826451974"&gt;by offering&lt;/a&gt; them a gift code that can be applied to their next movie or TV purchase — though you’ll have to redeem it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E2GdWg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google is shutting down the Google Play Movies &amp;amp; TV apps for Roku, Samsung, LG, and Vizio smart TVs on June 15, but past purchases should be available in the YouTube apps for those platforms, and you can use Play credits with YouTube. Watchlists won't transfer though. &lt;a href="https://t.co/WJh0qAYTPg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WJh0qAYTPg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Liliputing (@liliputingnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liliputingnews/status/1381704020826451974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Samsung’s new branded Hulu show is suspiciously light on Samsung</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ox1mR3B-WY45qE0fZsmJX0veA_8=/249x0:1980x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115757/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_5.45.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eXFOAD"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; — the upcoming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362153/samsung-s21-ultra-hulu-exposure-show-branded-content"&gt;Samsung-branded reality TV show&lt;/a&gt; from Hulu that’s one part photography competition, one part Galaxy S21 Ultra advertisement — is here. But for a show that’s been paid for by Samsung explicitly to highlight the power of the cameras on Samsung’s phones, it’s almost &lt;em&gt;suspiciously&lt;/em&gt; light on Samsung branding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lciBi9"&gt;If you just gave &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; a cursory glance (or, more likely, stumbled across it on Hulu one night) there’s nothing about it that immediately betrays its status as Samsung branded content. There’s no Samsung logo on the title card, no mention of the Galaxy S21 Ultra or its 108-megapixel camera system, or the various software add-ons that help Samsung’s smartphone stand out from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5lRhJ2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JKHEpyTJZRE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bMVzg"&gt;In fact, &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer just gives the impression of being a photography-centered competition series, like &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Chopped. &lt;/em&gt;Look more closely, of course, and the cracks start to show. A photography contest without any DSLRs or mirrorless cameras? Why doesn’t anyone have a bag full of lenses or a holster with a secondary shooter handy? And yes, I suppose all the contestants &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; appear to be using the same phone, now that you mention it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0Lpzj"&gt;Which is, of course, the point: &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; is, after all, still meant to highlight the S21 Ultra’s camera — even if its trailer isn’t exactly shoving that fact in your face. This either makes it the subtlest and best piece of branded content ever, or the worst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZO8ew"&gt;It’s possible that &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; will lean more heavily on its Samsung pedigree in the actual series itself; reality TV isn’t exactly known for its subtlety even in the most ordinary of circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ttpynq"&gt;But there is the chance that the limitations of only using Samsung’s latest smartphone could add some interesting wrinkles to the show. Any trained photographer that’s good enough to make it to &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt;’s level can almost certainly take great photos with their own equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJSsPf"&gt;But by introducing a common variable (the S21 Ultra’s hardware, for better and for worse), the show can theoretically be about who can use that specific tool the best with things like staging, lighting, and editing; similar to how cooking shows tend to make contestants work within the limitations of the dish or ingredients of the week, rather than just making the thing that they’re most comfortable preparing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3I8ZdP"&gt;We’ll find out when &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; arrives on Hulu on April 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYbYts"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb is trying to preemptively cancel post-pandemic bacchanals </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Airbnb Flag" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_7ueDkb4YHDiFO41ZyaA7ah0gM=/41x0:1268x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115588/Airbnb_Flag.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sEGKZb"&gt;Airbnb is attempting to put the kibosh on disruptive post-vaccine summer parties by launching its &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/"&gt;“Summer of Responsible Travel”&lt;/a&gt; plan, focused on offering more support to hosts and their neighbors, and adjusting its policies to prevent Airbnbs from being used for things other than calm, socially distanced stays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXHbib"&gt;Airbnb’s most noticeable change is a ban on one-night or last-minute stays on the Fourth of July, at least for those guests who &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have a history of receiving positive reviews from Airbnb hosts. The company is targeting the Fourth because it says the holiday is viewed as a “reopening date” for the US and potentially an occasion for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/large-gatherings.html"&gt;large gatherings that could spread COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PsxcYL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Airbnb already has a 16-person limit on gatherings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="96nXUQ"&gt;As the policy stands now, there are still some loopholes that might allow big Fourth of July celebrations to happen. If you’ve already booked before today, those reservations will be honored; the same is true if you have several positive reviews but just now decided to have a blowout gathering. But if you’re new to the platform and don’t have a review history, you might have a harder time booking a one-night stay. The policy is similar to what &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fresources%2Fhosting-homes%2Fa%2Fhow-were-helping-to-protect-against-parties-this-halloween-273&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379885%2Fairbnb-summer-responsible-travel-community-support-fno-parties-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Airbnb tried on Halloween&lt;/a&gt;. On that holiday, it canceled already-booked one-night reservations and refunded hosts, but it doesn’t seem to be taking the same tack with the Fourth of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpCrI1"&gt;Airbnb previously announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377408/airbnb-global-ban-house-parties-coronavirus"&gt;a global ban on house parties&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 and currently caps gatherings at 16 people. It’s not clear how often those policies are enforced or if more people show up to an event that only had 16 people invited to it. The last time Airbnb &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;blocked and canceled reservations&lt;/a&gt; for an event was during President Biden’s inauguration week, but its Fourth of July policy is more lenient. Even still, Airbnb is potentially impacting people who planned to book a spot and cutting itself out of reservation money in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs6UWQ"&gt;Airbnb will also begin to offer discounts on noise detection devices through &lt;a href="https://www.minut.com/"&gt;a company called Minut&lt;/a&gt;. Airbnb doesn’t specify the discount amount, but sensors cost $129 and monthly subscriptions can cost as much as $14.99 per month. Minut’s sensors don’t record anything, but they do track motion and loudness and automatically send notifications to guests when they pass certain decibel levels. It’s not as creepy as it could be, but it still might make guests uncomfortable. Airbnb says hosts will be required to mention if they use Minut’s devices on their listing pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAYDkB"&gt;Airbnb is also expanding its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fneighbors&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379885%2Fairbnb-summer-responsible-travel-community-support-fno-parties-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Neighborhood Support Line&lt;/a&gt; to cover Spanish-language calls. Neighborhood Support is a 24/7 service neighbors can use to complain about Airbnbs, sort of a first layer of protection to keep hosts and guests from necessarily having to deal with local authorities over something like a noise complaint — assuming an annoyed neighbor knows to call the hotline number (855-635-7754) to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8y9YO"&gt;Airbnb filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376338/airbnb-ipo-s1-filing-going-public-confidential"&gt;to go public&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, and in the process, it revealed an almost $700 million loss in revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570416/airbnb-coronavirus-pandemic-travel-hospitality"&gt;during 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Everything Airbnb has done since has happened in the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232769/airbnb-bloomberg-businessweek-chesky-venture-capital"&gt;whether it can bounce back&lt;/a&gt; after a hard year. Airbnb is in a tricky situation; it wants to encourage travel, but it also has to keep guests safe without completely preventing them from using its service. It seems like the “Summer of Responsible Travel” is as much about encouraging guests to stay responsible as it is about actually laying down the law.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXdULp"&gt;Intel could start producing in-demand semiconductors for car companies within six to nine months, CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, commenting that the chipmaking is already being discussed with companies that design chips for cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkQqjE"&gt;“We’re hoping that some of these things can be alleviated, not requiring a three- or four-year factory build, but maybe six months of new products being certified on some of our existing processes,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-idUSKBN2BZ2C4"&gt;Gelsinger told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve begun those engagements already with some of the key components suppliers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m796lz"&gt;Even if Intel is unable to meet that six to nine month goal, the news highlights the importance that Intel is placing on its new business as a producer of chips for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GpZjLI"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “We’ve begun those engagements already with some of the key components suppliers.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0cJuP6"&gt;Gelsinger unveiled the new business — called Intel Foundry Services — as a “standalone foundry business unit” last month at his “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/"&gt;Engineering the Future&lt;/a&gt;” announcement, with promises that the company would put its fabs to work producing x86, Arm, and RISC-V core chips for external clients. As part of that announcement, Intel also planned to invest $20 billion into expanding its fabs in Arizona to help it better meet demand from external partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKsYs7"&gt;The automotive industry has been one of the areas that’s been hit hardest by the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, with car companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; forced to shut down production or make changes to their trucks due to a lack of parts. If Intel is able to start producing automotive chips within the year, it could provide a much-needed new avenue of supply to alleviate those shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OS2dwQ"&gt;The global shortage has reached the point that the Biden administration is looking to intervene: the president has called for a review of the semiconductor supply chain in an executive order and hosted the executives of companies including Intel, Google, Ford, GM, TSMC, and Dell at the White House for today’s “CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNpeTx"&gt;“We’ve been falling behind on research and development and manufacturing, and, to put it bluntly, we have to step up our game,” Biden said at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyndryl is IBM’s wacky new name for its dry IT spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ibK9ox1dZb7gKtwIxZvDqWmzQUo=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115271/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdrUBq"&gt;Meet &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibms-independent-managed-infrastructure-services-business-to-be-named-kyndryl-301266347.html"&gt;Kyndryl&lt;/a&gt; — which, despite the name, is not a new legendary pokémon or a futuristic fake pharmaceutical from &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. No, Kyndryl is the new name for IBM’s legacy IT infrastructure business, which the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508974/ibm-split-into-two-companies-newco-hybrid-cloud-legacy-it"&gt;spinning off into a new company&lt;/a&gt; to allow the main company to focus on its newer (and more lucrative) areas of emphasis, like AI and cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z12AZW"&gt;I’ll let IBM’s press release explain: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ipQyeq"&gt; ”Kyn” is derived from the word &lt;em&gt;kinship&lt;/em&gt;, referencing the belief that relationships with people — employees, customers and partners — are at the center of the strategy, and that long-lasting relationships must be built and nurtured. “Dryl” comes from &lt;em&gt;tendril,&lt;/em&gt; bringing to mind new growth and the idea that — together with customers and partners — the business is always working toward advancing human progress.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PMCSVM"&gt;“Kinship” and “tendrils” — two of the first words that come to mind when one considers managed infrastructure services. Except, of course, with extra y’s added, “y” presumably being the letter that most conveys “the spirit of true partnership and growth” for which Kyndryl’s corporate IT setups stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaNxJ"&gt;In reality, it feels like the wholly bizarre branding is meant to be SEO bait. “NewCo” — the original placeholder for the branch of the company that is now known as Kyndryl — is the sort of name that fades into the background, while Kyndryl, bizarre as it may be, is at no danger of being confused or lost in a sea of similar Google results (mostly because there are none).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGqgzh"&gt;“Customers around the world will come to know Kyndryl as a brand that runs the vital systems at the heart of progress,” said Martin Schroeter, Kyndryl’s CEO. And with a name as... unique as the one selected here, he’s probably correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdbqzF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Salesforce to reopen San Francisco headquarters in May </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Salesforce To Purchase Popular Messaging Platform Slack For 27 Billion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxSAvzzmgXBHwydxCPNFUirCvGE=/0x0:3651x2434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115150/1229897073.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQRLwA"&gt;Salesforce said Monday that it will reopen its San Francisco headquarters in May, but its employees can still work remotely through the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu41GY"&gt;The company has already reopened 22 of its offices, according to company president and chief people officer Brent Hyder, who &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/global-return-to-the-office-the-salesforce-approach/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Salesforce would decide how and when to reopen each location based on guidance from health officials and medical experts. “We have an opportunity to create a workspace and an employee experience that makes us even more connected, healthy, innovative and productive,” Hyder wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5EPiI"&gt;The company plans a three-phase approach for offices, with the first phase limited to US employees who live in areas where coronavirus risk is flat or declining. Salesforce will require employees to take COVID-19 tests twice a week. The second phase will see offices gradually reopening from 20 to 75 percent capacity depending on local conditions, and the third stage will be a full office reopening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpCMue"&gt;Salesforce has been redesigning its offices with COVID-19 in mind, adding plexiglass between desks, air purifiers in conference rooms, touch-free handles for doors, and temperature screening stations, as well as providing hand sanitizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEH4xD"&gt;Salesforce is the &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/subscriber-only/2021/01/08/largest-employers-in-san-francisco.html"&gt;biggest employer in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s return to its downtown headquarters could be a bellwether for other companies in the area. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352742/facebook-uber-microsoft-twitter-apple-covid-19-offices-reopening"&gt;Facebook also plans to return&lt;/a&gt; to in-person work at its Bay Area offices next month, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-reopening/uber-to-reopen-san-francisco-offices-with-limited-capacity-next-week-idUSFWN2LN0XP"&gt;Uber reopened&lt;/a&gt; its Mission Bay headquarters, at limited capacity, on March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Korea says that the Wing, Velvet 5G, and Velvet LTE phones will get Android 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wDBuWsGUlparL02Rj8-GBW33go=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115027/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wing will be one of a few devices to receive OS upgrades for several years after LG exits the smartphone business.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhTjQN"&gt;LG’s Korean website now lists which phones the company plans to update to Android 12, along with a few devices which will even get Android 13. These upgrades will most likely come long after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;mobile industry exit&lt;/a&gt;, announced last week. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-Korea-reveals-which-phones-will-receive-Android-12-and-Android-13-update_id131368"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the &lt;a href="https://www.lge.co.kr/lgekor/contents/mobile/swUpgradeDetail.do?swSeq=1441"&gt;updated FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which previously stated that some models would get the OS upgrade to 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoiLYB"&gt;According to the FAQ, the LG Wing and both variants of the Velvet (LTE and 5G) will get Android 13. LG also says that those models, along with the V50, V50S, G8, Q31, Q52, and Q92, will receive an Android 12 upgrade. The company also notes that these two updates aren’t strictly guaranteed and will depend on product performance, product stabilization level, and Google policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBwiwF"&gt;LG Korea says that an Android 11 update, already in progress, is planned for the models mentioned above, along with the Q61, Q70, and Q9 One. As an aside, the Q-series models sold throughout Europe and Asia are similar to corresponding models sold as the K-series in the US but aren’t strictly a 1:1 match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4q1Bzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s7vL90"&gt;Availability and timing of updates will, of course, vary by region, but the list is a good indication of which models the company plans to prioritize. Recently, LG’s German website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;published a timetable&lt;/a&gt; for its Android 11 updates, most of which won’t be released until the end of the 2021. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;isn’t known for a great track record&lt;/a&gt; on platform updates, but it’s encouraging to see specific model names mentioned for the future upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos just let me copy text from a photo into my web browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utjEgpSyqETC6T_8fROrmld19s8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114734/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVugMv"&gt;The desktop Google Photos website seems to be getting the ability to scan for text in an image and turn it into copy-and-pasteable text, thanks to Google’s Lens technology (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/11/google-lens-photos-web/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Lens has been available in many places on Android for a while, but its optical character recognition (OCR) feature coming to the desktop could make Google Photos an easy and free way to get real-life text onto your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rE3m86"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, the feature seems to be rolling out widely, but a writer at &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-lens-google-photos-desktop-ocr-images/"&gt;didn’t have it show up for them&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to use it, though. To use it (or to check if you have it yet), load up the Google Photos site and go to a photo where you’ve captured some text (such as a page of a book, a sign, a receipt, etc). If Google detects words, a “Copy text from image” button should pop up, and clicking that will open a pane that lets you read the text that Google found.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fe_XHMoHp2S54SqRgagWO9KpOh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438687/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.49.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Copy text from image button will show up on images that Google finds text in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G6K85X"&gt;One practical application of having Lens on desktop could be scanning written text documents and pasting that into something you’re writing on a desktop computer. To test this, I took this picture of an open book, and the results were nearly flawless:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-OsJZ3z_tTCr5MMS5YBBTOqWwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438614/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.34.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can select the text directly on the photo or use the sidebar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i6gp4K"&gt;Lens even managed to interpret an “æ” correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaSb64"&gt;Google Lens has &lt;a href="https://lens.google.com"&gt;many more abilities&lt;/a&gt; on Android (and in the iOS Google Photos app), but it seems that text-copying is the only one that’s made it to the desktop so far. The browser version of Google Photos didn’t offer to translate a picture with Spanish text (though it did let me copy the text), and it doesn’t look like it can identify things like animals or plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXXU6L"&gt;Still, it’s nice to see one of Lens’ most useful features coming to the desktop version of Google Photos, and hopefully it’s an indication that more are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
