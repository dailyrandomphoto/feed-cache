    <title>Valve is working with AMD to make the Steam Deck Windows 11-ready</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vC3yB"&gt;Valve is aiming to make its Steam Deck handheld gaming PC ready for Windows 11. While we’ve known for weeks that the Steam Deck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;can run Windows&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t clear how well this would be supported by Valve, or whether an option for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)&lt;/a&gt; would be enabled to get Windows 11 on the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WrWAX"&gt;Now, Valve has confirmed it has been heavily focused on Windows support. “There’s work looking at TPM just now,” says Greg Coomer, a Valve Steam Deck designer, in &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-deck-windows-11-tpm-compatibility/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve focused so much on Windows 10, so far, that we haven’t really gotten that far into it. Our expectation is that we can meet that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKSqvN"&gt;Valve is working with AMD to make sure that TPM is supported at a BIOS level, and that the Steam Deck is ready for Windows 11. “So there’s nothing to indicate to us yet that there’ll be any issues with Windows 11,” explains Coomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="shL8ef"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve’s new Steam Deck can run Windows and turn into a handheld Xbox ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"},{"title":"Valve Steam Deck hands-on: the Nintendo Switch of PC gaming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VJvk98"&gt;That sounds encouraging for the ability to install Windows 11 on the Steam Deck once it launches later this year. While the handheld device will ship with SteamOS, a custom version of Linux, Valve will support Windows installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBaS1D"&gt;So why would you want Windows on the Steam Deck? Valve is still working on getting games with anti-cheat to run out of the box on this handheld, and it’s not guaranteed that titles like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gears 5 &lt;/em&gt;will work without Windows. “We’re working with BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat to get support for Proton ahead of launch,” &lt;a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq"&gt;says Valve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HldK20"&gt;The Steam Deck uses Valve’s Proton software to get a lot of officially unsupported Windows games to run on the device, but anti-cheat has been the biggest headache for Proton in recent years. Windows support avoids the obvious compatibility issues here, but it will bring with it an interface that isn’t tailored to a 7-inch screen, and lots of unknowns until we see just how well the OS works on the Steam Deck.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pushes back against child abuse scanning concerns in new FAQ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3UQv-Ep-FwzGk_VnzIk8s6KW_1M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69698169/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGzBGm"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2Fpdf%2FExpanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F9%2F22616381%2Fapple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has attempted to assuage concerns that its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;anti-child abuse measures&lt;/a&gt; could be turned into surveillance tools by authoritarian governments. “Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM [child sexual abuse material] stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it,” the company writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeChzT"&gt;Apple’s new tools, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;announced last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, include two features designed to protect children. One, called “communication safety,” uses on-device machine learning to identify and blur sexually explicit images received by children in the Messages app, and can notify a parent if a child age 12 and younger decides to view or send such an image. The second is designed to detect known CSAM by scanning users’ images if they choose to upload them to iCloud. Apple is notified if CSAM is detected, and it will alert the authorities when it verifies such material exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G0Hzjw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple’s CSAM detection capability is built solely to detect known CSAM images”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QqqbpC"&gt;The plans met with a swift backlash from digital &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;privacy groups and campaigners&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that these introduce a backdoor into Apple’s software. These groups note that once such a backdoor exists there is always the potential for it to be expanded to scan for types of content that go beyond child sexual abuse material. Authoritarian governments could use it to scan for politically dissent material, or anti-LGBT regimes could use it to crack down on sexual expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A2zHQ"&gt;“Even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor,” the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve already seen this mission creep in action. One of the technologies originally built to scan and hash child sexual abuse imagery has been repurposed to create a database of ‘terrorist’ content that companies can contribute to and access for the purpose of banning such content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArY2kw"&gt;However, Apple argues that it has safeguards in place to stop its systems from being used to detect anything other than sexual abuse imagery. It says that its list of banned images is provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other child safety organizations, and that the system “only works with CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child safety organizations.” Apple says it won’t add to this list of image hashes, and that the list is the same across all iPhones and iPads to prevent individual targeting of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5ce9I"&gt;The company also says that it will refuse demands from governments to add non-CSAM images to the list. “We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future,” it says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkMQzE"&gt;It’s worth noting that despite Apple’s assurances, the company has made concessions to governments in the past in order to continue operating in their countries. It sells &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204170#:~:text=FaceTime%20isn%27t%20available%20or,iPod%20touch%20in%20Saudi%20Arabia.&amp;amp;text=Search%20for%20the%20FaceTime%20app%20in%20Spotlight%20or%20using%20Siri."&gt;iPhones without FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; in countries that don’t allow encrypted phone calls, and in China it’s removed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374246/apple-china-chinese-operations-restrictions"&gt;thousands of apps from its App Store&lt;/a&gt;, as well as moved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security"&gt;store user data on the servers of a state-run telecom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1f0jU"&gt;The FAQ also fails to address some concerns about the feature that scans Messages for sexually explicit material. The feature does not share any information with Apple or law enforcement, the company says, but it doesn’t say how it’s ensuring that the tool’s focus remains solely on sexually explicit images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXy2yk"&gt;“All it would take to widen the narrow backdoor that Apple is building is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content, or a tweak of the configuration flags to scan, not just children’s, but anyone’s accounts,” wrote the EFF. The EFF also notes that machine-learning technologies frequently classify this content incorrectly, and cites &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/tossedout/tumblr-ban-adult-content"&gt;Tumblr’s attempts to crack down on sexual content&lt;/a&gt; as a prominent example of where the technology has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SteamVR beta lets you arrange desktop windows inside your virtual world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/is9-k_gW9UY3Gy3jnHGeUHbBeXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69697994/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="65t9Xd"&gt;As of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/2979680118212870441"&gt;latest beta release&lt;/a&gt;, Valve’s SteamVR software can add floating desktop windows inside VR games, letting you keep an eye on other apps without leaving VR. It’s a helpful addition, allowing players to keep an eye on anything from Discord, to a Twitch chat, or Netflix during a lower-intensity game. &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-update-1-19-6-floating-desktop-windows/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Road to VR&lt;/em&gt; suggests&lt;/a&gt; you could even watch YouTube during longer flights in &lt;em&gt;Elite Dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Icnn"&gt;The ability to interact with the rest of your desktop from within SteamVR’s dashboard is not a new feature, but recently Valve has been making the system more flexible. Earlier this year it added the option to view individual application windows in the dashboard, and to be virtually &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/steamvr-beta-update-virtual-desktop-window-view-controller-attach/"&gt;attached to VR controllers&lt;/a&gt; ingame. This made apps viewable at a glance, but until now it lacked the ability to float windows persistently ingame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fSTlR7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Windows are view-only when the SteamVR menu is closed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FiA3PQ"&gt;With the latest release, you can still opt to have a window attached to your controller, or pull it off to have it float in virtual space. The windows are view-only while you’re actually playing a game, but you can open up the SteamVR menu to interact with them using a VR controller as a mouse pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kY2Ui"&gt;The new floating windows are available as of version 1.19.6 of SteamVR. This version of the software is currently available in beta, but it’s relatively easy to opt in via SteamVR’s properties window (accessible by right clicking it in your Steam games list). Despite all the new features being added to the VR platform, there’s still no sign of version 2.0 of SteamVR that Valve &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697229969000435735"&gt;teased early last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVV42B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xuHFq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New report reveals how the climate crisis is supercharging extreme weather</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Southeast Texas Inundated After Harvey Makes Second Pass Over The Region" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oCAEcIdhTjlHTPH-shO53PhcM20=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69697962/841346500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A home is surrounded by floodwater after torrential rains pounded Southeast Texas following Hurricane and Tropical Storm Harvey on August 31, 2017 near Orange, Texas. Researchers later determined that climate change supercharged the storm, and was was responsible for up to $67 billion of the $90 billion in damage caused by Harvey.  | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bZMAGw"&gt;We now have the clearest picture yet of how different the world is today as a result of human-driven climate change. The most comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; to date on the physical science of climate change was published today by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ4DzF"&gt;“Climate change is a problem that is here now. Nobody’s safe, and it’s getting worse faster,” Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme said in a press conference today. “We must treat climate change as an immediate threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNxERe"&gt;Extreme events — from floods to heatwaves and droughts — have gotten worse, it says in a nutshell. And scientists are even more certain than they were before that humans’ greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane (which makes up a majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;“natural gas”&lt;/a&gt;), are to blame.				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vvZesy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nobody’s safe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UpZ1jU"&gt;“We’ve known for decades that the world is warming, but this report tells us that recent changes in the climate are widespread, rapid, intensifying, and unprecedented in thousands of years,” Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC, said in an August 8th press briefing. “It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkkWOd"&gt;The IPCC is considered a leading authority on climate science, and its new report has more than 230 authors from 66 countries around the world. Today’s findings are an update to a similar report in 2013, and they incorporate the body of research that’s been published in scientific journals since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbLNKp"&gt;Researchers have gotten a lot better at judging how much climate change affects individual weather events since 2013, which makes a big difference this time around. For example: in July, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;record-smashing heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in the US Pacific Northwest and Southwest Canada &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled roads&lt;/a&gt; and killed hundreds of people. In less than two weeks, an international team of researchers was able to determine that the extreme heat would have been “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWEB1l"&gt;Nearly every region of the world outside of polar regions have seen an uptick in extreme heat events since the 1950s, according to the new IPCC report. Across the globe, extreme heatwaves now occur five times more frequently than they did between 1850 and 1900 (a baseline often referred to as the pre-industrial period), according to the report. Heat also exacerbates drought in some regions of the world. Droughts that previously only occurred once every decade are now 70 percent more frequent than they were in the pre-industrial era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfQa18"&gt;The consequences of the climate crisis, however, are diverse and far-reaching. Severe storms and floods are another growing problem. What were previously once-in-a-decade downpours are happening 30 percent more frequently today. When it comes to tropical cyclones, there’s a greater proportion of major storms (ranked a category 3 or higher), meaning hurricanes and typhoons have grown stronger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="S6VzKU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Extreme weather is occurring with more frequency across the entire planet.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bzSLst"&gt;“Extreme weather is occurring with more frequency across the entire planet,” Paola Andrea Arias Gómez, one of the authors of the IPCC report, said during yesterday’s press briefing. “We now can attribute that these changes are mainly driven by human activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrzcdS"&gt;More bad news: without drastic action to curb the use of fossil fuels, things will get worse. Leading climate experts have set a target of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; in order to avoid some of the worst-case scenarios that climate change could create. We’ve already reached 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming, and the report says we could reach or even surpass that dreaded 1.5 degree threshold within the next couple of decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVcw4V"&gt;What does that mean for extreme weather? Get ready for more “unprecedented” events — basically, things that have never happened before. The report authors outline five ways this is expected to happen in the future: extreme events will be even more extreme. They’ll be more frequent. There’s a greater chance of extreme events happening back to back or even different kinds of disasters happening at the same time. They’ll happen in places that surprise us. And the timing of these catastrophes will be unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5LCNN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This report is a reality check.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1zD5gc"&gt;There are all sorts of other problems detailed in the new report, including vanishing ice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;rising sea levels&lt;/a&gt;, and scary tipping points that could accelerate the pace of the climate crisis. There are also two more key reports expected to be published by the IPCC early next year: one that details how all of these changes to the planet will affect human life as we know it and another one that outlines potential solutions. Notably, today’s report is the only one that will be ready in time for the upcoming United Nations climate conference in November when world leaders are expected to discuss ratcheting up commitments to rein in their planet-heating pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8SK5P"&gt;“This report is a reality check,” Valérie Masson-Delmotte, co-chair of the IPCC working group responsible for the report, said in a press release. “We now have a much clearer picture of the past, present and future climate, which is essential for understanding where we are headed, what can be done, and how we can prepare.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYugur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 9th 5:00AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from IPCC press conference. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PEGNRi"&gt;So in addition to watching &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, missing &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesdays, and keeping my Paramount Plus subscription current so I can watch the extremely underappreciated show &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt;, I’m still slogging through &lt;em&gt;Manifest. &lt;/em&gt;I’m halfway through Season 2,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the plot has become weirdly elaborate and yet the show remains so cheesy that I must see how things end up. Of course, we’re awaiting word from Netflix about whether there will be any seasons past the show’s third, but &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflix-reconsiders-saving-manifest-1234985839/"&gt;recent developments look promising&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81Po6J"&gt;On to the latest trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qn494F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EEQ5Lj-cXM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2gDEc"&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="e6eDfe"&gt;The very long-awaited show based on the comic book series of the same name by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra is finally arriving. Every mammal in the world with a Y chromosome is suddenly wiped out, except for a dude named Yorick (alas) and his pet monkey, and chaos ensues, of course. Ben Schnetzer, Ashley Romans, Olivia Thirlby, and Diane Lane star in the series &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; (which FX has said &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/timothy-hutton-replaced-y-the-last-man-fx-1234818302/"&gt;would have all-female&lt;/a&gt; directors). It comes to FX on Hulu September 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7LZnJC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-FmWuCgJmxo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IS9QmU"&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DzZPBY"&gt;There is plenty of carnage in this sequel to 2018’s &lt;em&gt;Venom, &lt;/em&gt;but the title also refers to Carnage the former serial killer who also becomes host of an alien symbiote and (our hero?) Venom’s enemy. Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Williams, and Naomie Harris star in &lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Andy Serkis. It comes to theaters this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5pcwgx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azqXzb0xeBI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CWHmxC"&gt;The Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Hxmn5p"&gt;I have grumbled before about the difference between teasers (short) and trailers (longer) but here comes the “date announcement.” At some point we’ll presumably get a teaser and/or a trailer for Season 2 of the very funny and raunchy &lt;em&gt;The Great&lt;/em&gt;, but for now we get Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult trading quips in period costumes. &lt;em&gt;The Great&lt;/em&gt; returns to Hulu November 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fLEO1a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdbXnboJCVw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DLHA4l"&gt;Army of Thieves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8wXVwx"&gt;Of all the characters from Zack Snyder’s summer zombie flick &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; to get a prequel, the safecracking Dieter ... was not the first one I thought of. Here, he’s a bank teller who gets drawn into a criminal ring who want to crack safes across Europe (and he’s heard something about the outbreak in America turning people into flesh-eating monsters). And FYI the &lt;s&gt;trailer&lt;/s&gt;, sorry the teaser, only shows zombies on “news reports.” Co-written by Snyder and directed by Dieter himself, aka Matthias Schweighöfer, &lt;em&gt;Army of Thieves&lt;/em&gt; also stars Nathalie Emmanuel, and Ruby O. Fee. No release date yet, but it’s coming soon to Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vuynKK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MysGjRS9jFU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOdWRD"&gt;Kate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vY6ksk"&gt;An assassin is poisoned just before a hit on an Asian bad guy and she has a matter of hours to find out who killed her. I’m not sure whether it’s that the “lady assassin” plot seems familiar and a bit tired, or if it’s just particularly unsettling to watch a white woman kill a slew of Asians on screen while there’s been an &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22558949/china-violence-asian-americans"&gt;uptick in violence against AAPI people&lt;/a&gt; in the real world, but this trailer isn’t quite doing it for me. Perhaps I am wrong (it has been known to happen) after all, this is only two minutes and 45 seconds worth of the movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Woody Harrelson, and Miku Martineau star in &lt;em&gt;Kate&lt;/em&gt;, which hits Netflix on September 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla will reportedly require workers at its Nevada battery factory to wear masks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8UXpcjXsCc888Egumj6vc6qG8Jg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69696290/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla will reportedly require masks as its Nevada plant | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kXhAhv"&gt;All Tesla workers at the company’s battery factory in Reno, Nevada will be required to wear masks indoors beginning Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-to-require-masks-at-nevada-battery-factory-11628444515?mod=latest_headlines"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The plant already required workers unvaccinated against COVID-19 to wear masks indoors, but the new rule includes vaccinated workers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUexZ"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/nevada"&gt;Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center,&lt;/a&gt; Nevada has seen more than 26,000 new COVID infections in the past month, and 298 deaths. The center estimates that nearly 47 percent of the state’s population has been vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJLkfZ"&gt;At the beginning of the pandemic last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk pushed back against COVID restrictions, including stay-at-home orders in Alameda County, California, where its Fremont plant is located. While the company eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21187419/tesla-factory-shutdown-fremont-new-york-gigafactory-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;agreed to temporarily shut down operations&lt;/a&gt; at the Fremont facility in March 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254871/tesla-fremont-shutdown-factory-production-model-3-y-elon-musk"&gt;Musk announced in May&lt;/a&gt; 2020 that he was reopening the plant in defiance of local shelter-in-place orders, going so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;sue the county&lt;/a&gt; and threatening to move Tesla operations out of California. In November, Musk tweeted that he likely had a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1327743762273955841?s=20"&gt;moderate case of covid&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAxEQP"&gt;On August 3rd of this year, California &lt;a href="https://covid-19.acgov.org/face-masks.page?"&gt;updated its mask rules&lt;/a&gt;, requiring everyone 2 years of age and older to wear masks in indoor public settings, regardless of vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmEkb3"&gt;Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak revived that state’s &lt;a href="https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.29.21-Mask-Guidance-1.pdf"&gt;mask mandate&lt;/a&gt; late last month, just ahead of new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People in Nevada must wear face masks indoors in public in counties that have “substantial or high transmission,” which included Clark, where Las Vegas is located, and Washoe, where Reno is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry6n1W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Report finds Doximity, a social network for doctors, is riddled with anti-vaccine comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2VDmQLz5KrbmaliVTHpOnEVTn0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69692977/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vaccine misinformation appears rampant on a social media site for doctors | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H5wAkq"&gt;A social media site for doctors is seeing “hundreds of comments”— many with false claims and conspiracy theories— on posts about the COVID-19 vaccine and the pandemic, according to a new report &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/doximity-social-network-for-doctors-full-of-antivax-disinformation.html"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Doximity is limited to healthcare professionals in the US— it verifies members before they can join— and no one who posts to the site is anonymous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Y9VI"&gt;Doximity also doesn’t allow users to post articles or stories; instead it posts items from medical and science publications and mainstream news articles. Each user has a feed of aggregated content that is customized for them, based on the user’s preferences including area of medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9If3m"&gt;But Doximity members &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; comment on articles, which is where the misinformation and conspiracy theories seem to proliferate, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported. For instance, it found comments on a recent article about face masks for children included many from doctors who oppose the vaccine, saying masking children was “ridiculous” and “a form of child abuse.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoM8DV"&gt;This, despite the overwhelming evidence and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"&gt;guidance from public health organizations&lt;/a&gt; that masks help prevent the spread of the virus, and, the fact that there &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-next-stage-of-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-in-united-states-children-under-12/"&gt;isn’t yet a  COVID-19 vaccine approved&lt;/a&gt; for children under 12 years old. And, despite rules in Doximity’s own &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/clinicians/community_guidelines"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; which list “spreading false or misleading information” as grounds for removal from the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5x1q7"&gt;Doximity is scheduled to release its &lt;a href="https://investors.doximity.com/news/events/event-details/2021/Doximity-Q1-2022-Earnings-Call/default.aspx"&gt;first-quarter results&lt;/a&gt; on August 10th. The company, which was founded in 2010, launched its IPO in June, and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021012935/doximity-424b4.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that it had 1.8 million members, which included 80 percent of physicians in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1jpl"&gt;A spokesperson for Doximity wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company has community guidelines in place that are meant to keep the site a safe, respectful environment. “While we encourage our members to share their views in our comments section, we explicitly prohibit the sharing of medical misinformation,” the spokesperson added. “Our policies reflect Doximity’s strong commitment to addressing and removing medical misinformation. As such, we employ a rigorous clinical review process, staffed by physicians, to evaluate member comments that are flagged as being potential misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Cybertruck production delayed to 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVL_JLMTeUsQ81LrC9txnL8_Oi4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69695801/sokane_191112_3807_8389.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IxlLAz"&gt;Production on Tesla’s Cybertruck, the automaker’s first electric pickup truck, has been delayed until 2022 according to its order page on the company’s website. First reported by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/07/tesla-confirms-cybertruck-electric-pickup-delay-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, under the “due today” section of the Cybertruck’s order page it now reads “you will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.” This appears to apply to the single- dual- and tri-motor versions of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DlnsRYvz1srlTbJ2dAuSQBjTUWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769543/cybertruck.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The configuration page for Tesla’s Cybertruck as of August 8th, 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MuWtJf"&gt;The delay isn’t a huge surprise to those who have been following Cybertruck news closely. When Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;Elon Musk unveiled it in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the plan called for the first Cybertrucks to roll off the assembly line in late 2021. In January during &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GczshcYSAc&amp;amp;ab_channel=Tesla"&gt;Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said there would be a “few deliveries of the Cybertruck toward the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="apsblI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla Cybertruck will get up to 500 miles of range and start at $39,900","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z7IgDc"&gt;Last month during its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbowECqC0Ig&amp;amp;ab_channel=Tesla"&gt;second-quarter earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla’s VP of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy said the Cybertruck was “at a stage where we finished basic engineering of the architecture of the vehicle,” adding that it was “moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year.” So it seemed unlikely at that point that Cybertrucks would be shipping in 2021. Now, Tesla’s order page has confirmed it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this look at how Amazon third-party sellers pester customers who leave bad reviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2YXByBD3b3lElhkpgL1d_ClK0k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69695596/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Some Amazon third-party sellers find ways to contact customers who leave bad reviews | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfTQjg"&gt;When you buy something on Amazon, the e-commerce giant isn’t always the one making the sale; an &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259782/third-party-seller-share-of-amazon-platform/"&gt;estimated half of all products&lt;/a&gt; sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers. Amazon says it’s merely the conduit between buyer and seller, and doesn’t bear responsibility if a third-party product is defective (although some recent court cases have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414185/california-appeals-court-amazon-marketplace-responsible-third-party-hoverboard"&gt;challenged that stance&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFrHdP"&gt;Third-party sellers aren’t supposed to be able to email Amazon customers directly outside of the platform, but a new report in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-amazon-customers-leave-negative-reviews-some-sellers-hunt-them-down-11628420400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that some sellers can find ways to get in touch with buyers who leave negative product reviews, and some businesses even offer “email extraction” for buyers as a service to sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc5WVC"&gt;So rather than paying people to give favorable reviews, a practice &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/amazon-bans-incentivized-reviews-tied-to-free-or-discounted-products/"&gt;Amazon banned in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, these third-party sellers go after people who leave a bad product review and offer them payment to change or delete it (a practice which is also a violation of Amazon’s rules). Nicole Nguyen writes in the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;about Katherine Scott, who bought an oil spray bottle for cooking which didn’t work as advertised, so she left a negative review. A week later, she got an email that looked to be from a customer service rep from the oil sprayer company offering a refund if she deleted the review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lS9vzn"&gt;Ms. Scott asked for a refund but didn’t want to delete her review. Another representative reached out the next day and declined to issue her refund. “A bad review is a fatal blow to us,” read the email. “Could you help me delete the review? If you can, I want to refund $20 to you to express my gratitude.” (This was twice what Ms. Scott paid.) A few hours later, she received another plea from the same email address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kU99hH"&gt;Amazon told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; it does not share customer email addresses with third-party sellers, and that it removed some 200 million fake reviews last year alone. But Nguyen writes that third-party sellers are finding ways to email customers all the same. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-amazon-customers-leave-negative-reviews-some-sellers-hunt-them-down-11628420400"&gt;Go read this excellent report&lt;/a&gt; which includes advice for how to shield your email address from Amazon sellers who shouldn’t have it in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ISS astronauts show off zero-gravity moves in the space Olympics which should be a real thing</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Synchronized space swimming aboard the International Space Station | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Thom_astro/status/1423780686020894721?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;ESA/Thomas Pesquet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SPcl2U"&gt;The Tokyo Olympics have ended, with the closing ceremonies &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/tokyo-2020-olympics-08-08-21-spt/index.html"&gt;wrapping things up Sunday&lt;/a&gt; (NBC will broadcast them Sunday evening in the US). But before we bid farewell to one of the more unusual Olympics in recent memory, the astronauts aboard the International Space Station have a few last-minute entries for judges’ consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dppdyC"&gt;French astronaut Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency posted a series of four videos to Twitter showing some of the ISS  astronauts performing — I guess we’ll call them “routines”— in zero gravity that would make fine additions to future Olympics. They even hung little flags of all the countries represented over their performance area. The videos are pretty adorkable (and watch with the sound on, I promise it’s worth it for the music and the play-by-play).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5c7zyM"&gt;We start with the “lack of floor routine” gymnastics— I can’t figure out the rules here (is it touch nothing or touch everything?) but everyone gets points for style: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rgYlhV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Space &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Olympics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Olympics&lt;/a&gt; 1/4:&lt;br&gt;Lack-of-floor routine – much   to Pyotr for completing his routine without touching anything, a difficult feat! &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gym hors-sol – on ne dirait pas comme ça, mais les immobilisations en plein vol de Piotr requièrent une grande expérience&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MissionAlpha?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MissionAlpha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gXAHSHHmcu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gXAHSHHmcu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_astro/status/1423780299243196422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMmgnz"&gt;Next up is &lt;strong&gt;“no-handball”&lt;/strong&gt; aka space field hockey, which seems much, much harder in zero gravity, and they sort of adapt and modify the rules as they go along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WV4QYS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Space &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Olympics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Olympics&lt;/a&gt; 2/4:&lt;br&gt;No-handball – we had to adapt the rules a bit during the match, much investment on both sides for the win.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Handball sans les mains – les règles ont dû être adaptées au cours d’un match que nous décrirons sobrement comme intense. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dVOv3GRThD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dVOv3GRThD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_astro/status/1423780526230548480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3pXSl"&gt;This is my personal favorite:&lt;strong&gt; “synchronized space swimming” &lt;/strong&gt;they clearly worked hard on these routines despite the lack of water that the terrestrial version of the sport requires:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gHL03B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Space &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Olympics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Olympics&lt;/a&gt; 3/4:&lt;br&gt;Synchronised space swimming – an opportunity to show teamwork and crew cohesion.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Flottation synchronisée – l’occasion de démontrer une des plus importantes compétences un astronaute : l’esprit d’équipe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MissionAlpha?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MissionAlpha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ljo65AkzNQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ljo65AkzNQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_astro/status/1423780686020894721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eeFnBk"&gt;And finally we have &lt;strong&gt;weightless sharpshooting&lt;/strong&gt; where they shoot what look like rubber bands at a makeshift target:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwkJLk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Space &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Olympics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Olympics&lt;/a&gt; 4/4:&lt;br&gt;Weightless sharpshooting – concentration and skill (or luck) proved necessary to reach the target. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tir sans gravité – concentration et persévérance ont dicté cette épreuve pour bien négocier la trajectoire des élastiques&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MissionAlpha?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MissionAlpha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eV2cSxEWQ5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eV2cSxEWQ5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_astro/status/1423780871761534980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmAn8W"&gt;You guys, they even did a &lt;strong&gt;“closing ceremony”&lt;/strong&gt; on Sunday; Aki Hoshide of JAXA (Japan’s space agency) handed an Olympic flag to the Frenchman Pesquet, extremely fitting since the 2024 Olympics will be in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na6KmG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kG7eWB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Avec Aki on a pris un peu d’avance sur la &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClosingCeremony?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ClosingCeremony&lt;/a&gt; en attendant le vrai passage de relais &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tokyo2020?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tokyo2020&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Paris2024?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Paris2024&lt;/a&gt; sur   dans quelques heures &lt;br&gt;      &lt;br&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tokyo2020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Tokyo2020&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Olympics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Olympics&lt;/a&gt; ending today and the next &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Olympics?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Olympics&lt;/a&gt; to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Paris2024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Paris2024&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Aki_Hoshide?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Aki_Hoshide&lt;/a&gt; and I held a ceremony &lt;a href="https://t.co/7dpYBr4Xwu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7dpYBr4Xwu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_astro/status/1424278282300702720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6OWzOc"&gt;The real Olympics are fine and all, and congratulations to everyone who won a medal, but I think watching astronauts twirl in synch with each other and bat around a tiny ball in space would draw huge audiences to future games. Get on it, International Olympic Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
