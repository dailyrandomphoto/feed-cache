    <title>Nreal’s $599 mixed reality glasses are launching in the US on Verizon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of Nreal glasses supported by a hand" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H9r32T_8J2_kad3ER2uSnHmv0G4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159740/Nreal_Light_3_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nreal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zkr2hd"&gt;Nreal’s augmented reality glasses are coming to the US through a Verizon partnership. The $599 Nreal Light glasses will appear in 20 Verizon stores nationwide on November 30th and be available for purchase online December 2nd. The glasses are compatible with several recent 5G-enabled Samsung phones and one OnePlus 5G device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMAB4A"&gt;The Nreal Light is one of the only consumer-focused AR headsets on the market. The Light glasses launched first in Korea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362407/nreal-light-ar-glasses-lg-uplus-samsung-galaxy-note-retail-launch-availability-price"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and they’ve since expanded to Japan and Germany. They support projecting 3D images into real space using reflected micro OLED displays, while outward-facing cameras let the glasses scan real space and pin virtual objects — like screens or game boards — into particular locations. The visual experience is broadly similar to the Microsoft HoloLens or Magic Leap One, although the Light uses different optics technology. Nreal particularly touts the glasses’ wider-than-average 53 degree field of view, as well as a light 106-gram design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BauMVN"&gt;Nreal’s glasses are powered by an Android smartphone — in the US, they’ll work with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus 5G, Samsung Galaxy S21 5G, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G UW, Samsung Galaxy S20 5G UW, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, and OnePlus 8 5G UW. Once you’ve plugged it into the glasses, you can either directly mirror your phone screen, including streaming video apps, or enter a full mixed reality experience that includes some AR games and productivity tools. The phone itself acts as a controller, although Nreal also lets developers build apps with hand tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIf8GD"&gt;Earlier this year, Nreal announced that it was launching a second, cheaper pair of camera-free glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22700782/nreal-air-smart-ar-glasses-release-date-shipping-countries"&gt;called the Nreal Air&lt;/a&gt;. Those glasses are set to debut in China, Japan, and Korea, with no launch date set for the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. Smash-style fighter pits Bugs Bunny against Arya Stark</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lUiaYOCI3GkJGczPOiDJ8rHB6xA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159705/MultiVersus_TomJerry_Steven_Superman_Shaggy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1WofMH"&gt;After numerous leaks hinted that a new fighting game with Warner Bros. characters was in the works, Warner Bros. Games finally put the rumors to bed with the announcement of &lt;em&gt;MultiVersus&lt;/em&gt;. The announcement was a three-minute trailer showing off a healthy chunk of gameplay and some of the initial roster of characters including Bugs Bunny, Steven Universe, and, curiously, Arya “A Girl Has No Name” Stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjPNZ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MultiVersus&lt;/em&gt; is a free-to-play &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros&lt;/em&gt;-like game director Tony Huynh says is focused on teamwork and social play. Characters are designed to be mixed and matched together with strengths that augment one another. In the video, you can see Steven Universe using his signature shield to protect his partner, while Wonder Woman whisks her partner out of danger with her lasso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIVkEA"&gt;Players can compete in two-vs-two cooperative battles, four-player free-for-all, and on a ranked competitive ladder. Huynh also mentioned that &lt;em&gt;MultiVersus&lt;/em&gt; will feature rollback netcode, crossplay, and cross-progression to create a seamless experience for players across multiple platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvJb8t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/warner-bros-fighting-game-roster-leak-reveals-harley-quinn-shaggy-and-more/"&gt;Rumors swirled around &lt;em&gt;MultiVersus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when an image of the roster was leaked by professional &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; player Juan Manuel “Hungrybox” DeBiedma. The image and DeBiedma’s video breaking it down was later removed via copyright strike further fueling speculation something was forthcoming from Warner Bros. Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orIJhG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MultiVersus&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled for release in 2022 on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Moto G Power offers a 50-megapixel camera and three days of battery life for $199</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JhpbTvC4yBbwcmF0XOk-AdIa9kw=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159667/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Luu2qu"&gt;Motorola has announced the latest version of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%3Fid%3D380&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22789061%2Fmoto-g-power-2022-model-specs-release-date-battery-life-motorola" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;budget Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; smartphone, which keeps the $199.99 starting price point and three-day battery life, but with additional camera, display, and spec improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZprSy"&gt;The new Moto G Power (which I’m referring to as the 2022 model for sanity’s sake, especially considering that it’ll be out sometime in “the coming months”) has a lot in common with the company’s previous model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The new model looks to improve on most aspects of the device in one way or another, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTyl0M"&gt;The screen is now slightly smaller, at 6.5 inches instead of 6.6 inches, but adds a faster 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling. RAM has been bumped up from 3GB to 4GB, and the two storage tiers have been doubled to 64GB and 128GB for $199.99 and $249.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azDOML46taGxD_nFLQ67jJ3HC0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024340/moto_g_power_Dark_Grove.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3bDAlh"&gt;Motorola has also slotted in a new processor, switching away from the Snapdragon 662 processor in last year’s model to a MediaTek Helio G37, which should provide better performance and power efficiency. The star of the spec sheet, however, is still the massive 5,000mAh battery which, while still the same size as last year, also makes the same promise of three days of use off a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrXst8"&gt;Lastly, there’s the new camera system, which has a new 50-megapixel main sensor, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor on the back for adding blurred bokeh effects to shots. There’s also an 8-megapixel front facing camera (which has been centered again) with a new “Dual Capture” feature that lets you shoot with both the front and rear cameras at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm9g3v"&gt;Motorola isn’t announcing specific release information for the new Moto G Power at this time. We do know that it’ll be coming first to Republic Wireless and Metro by T-Mobile sometime “in the coming months,” before becoming more broadly available at Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, Google Fi, Boost, Xfinity Mobile, US Cellular, and Cricket. It’ll also be sold unlocked at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola’s website sometime in “early 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Cross some names off your list without spending a mint&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hEtH8u"&gt;It should go without saying, but the best gifts aren’t always the most expensive.

Whether you’re in the market for a vest to keep your beverage from getting chilly or chopsticks from a galaxy far, far away, our budget-friendly gift guide is a manifestation of everything that you want, but nothing you need. Even if you’re shopping for yourself instead of someone special, we know that our suggestions will help make your life a little easier or, at the very least, coax out a smile.

    <title>Motorola Moto G Pure review: an easy bargain</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For casual users, this $160 4G phone is good enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PfY8IN"&gt;The Moto G Pure is the rare $160 phone that works well enough that you forget you’re using a sub-$200 device. Yes, Motorola made some compromises to deliver a phone at this low price point, but it still nails all the basics that you should care about: good build quality, good battery life, and good cameras for the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik6WHn"&gt;That is not to say the Moto phone is perfect. Its processor is just a second slower in most tasks, it only works on 4G networks, and its paltry 32GB of internal storage is just not enough space to use for long. But for its price, it’s hard to argue against the Moto G Pure — it gets a lot right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VDmDAF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10871077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hQaep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DI4Ddk"&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact, measuring 0.34-inch thick and weighing 0.41lbs. Thanks to its rounded corners and sloped edges, the G Pure is comfortable to hold for long stretches, though it’s a bit tall (the screen has a 20:9 aspect ratio) to use single-handed for my small hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OM443k"&gt;Available in deep indigo, the G Pure has a subtle sheen to its textured, matte back cover. Its plastic material is very hard and slippery, despite that texture. In fact, I’ve lost count of the number of times the phone has magically slipped off an ottoman or table and still works. Yes, this $160 Moto phone is quite durable, but I wouldn’t test the smartphone gods — you’ll still be better off with a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DncdMx"&gt;It has a snappy fingerprint sensor under the Motorola logo, as well as Face Unlock to give you a hands-free option to unlock your phone. I like that the Moto software gives you more control over how this works. You can use your face to unlock the phone (no need to press the power button first), and ask the phone to bring you to the last app or webpage that was opened (rather than the lockscreen). With good lighting, Face Unlock works well enough, but the fingerprint sensor is faster and more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2NRUxvZ044iPffFsdlFOZ-z8VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956983/gsin_190203_4806_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CuYpZV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Md2AB3"&gt;As part of the cost cutting to hit the G Pure’s low price, Motorola decided to use a weak processor and minimal RAM, and it shows. At the heart of the Moto phone is the MediaTek Helio G25 processor, which is &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/chipset-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-439-vs-mediatek-helio-g25"&gt;comparable to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 439&lt;/a&gt; but actually lags behind that 2018 Snapdragon chipset. Everything from opening a website, switching between apps, to opening the camera app to take a photo just takes an extra second on the Moto phone. While this doesn’t sound like much, those extra seconds really add up over the course of a day and can make you question your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvxvTM"&gt;It has just 3GB of RAM to support its under-powered processor and a meager 32GB of internal storage. At this point, 32GB is simply not enough capacity for a phone, especially when most people are hanging onto their phones for longer. After just two weeks of light use — installing updates and a few apps, plus taking some photos — I’ve already burned through 18.04GB (56 percent of storage) on the G Pure. With Motorola promising one OS update and two years of security updates, you’ll likely run out of space before you run out of software support. Good thing it has a microSD card slot, where you can expand its limited capacity with up to a 512GB card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor and side buttons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLvv2alnMT6GmDuVEDNdMV3fEfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956981/gsin_190203_4806_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Motorola logo is the Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor for securing your phone against intruders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHLGK"&gt;The G Pure’s 6.5-inch LCD screen may look vibrant with its brightness set to 100 percent, but it is only a 720p display, with a low 269 pixel density. At 1600 x 720p resolution, &lt;em&gt;The Spider-Man: No Way Home Trailer&lt;/em&gt; looks more pixelated and dim on the Moto than on the OnePlus 9’s 2K display. Day to day, you probably wouldn’t notice just how low-res the display is, but if you have any higher-quality screens in your life, it will stand out and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlHPgF"&gt;I played some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt; to stress test it, and performance was better than I expected, at least once I was able to launch the game fully. It took three tries and multiple force quits on it before I could actually play. Once the game finally loaded, I was able to move my pokemon around the battlefield without lag, with the battle music blaring from the lone speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qch758"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ISV0DW"&gt;Using only 4G service to test the G Pure’s 4,000mAh battery, I spent the day toggling between two email accounts, sharing content on Twitter and Hangouts, and playing some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. The G Pure stayed cool to the touch no matter how much I was stressing it. Although the battery didn’t quite live up to the two days of use claim from Motorola, I got about 16 hours out of it (or about seven hours of screentime) before needing to hit the charger. Don’t expect a fast charge, though: It took me about two hours to recharge this battery with the included 10W charging brick. In all, the battery should last you a full day at minimum, or maybe as long as two days for a light user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure dual camera system closeup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VaoTg8icuZpo5S9iQOv6bht5kBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956982/gsin_190203_4806_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure kept it simple with a rear, dual-camera system, rather than add a sub-par ultrawide or macro camera onto the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r3rGf7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BMQtq0"&gt;For a $160 phone, the cameras on the Moto G Pure are better than expected, especially for photos that you’ll likely only share online. Rather than squeeze another lackluster ultrawide or macro camera onto the back, Motorola made a smart decision to keep it simple with just a rear dual-camera system — a 13-megapixel main camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor — plus a 5-megapixel front-facing camera (f/2.4) for selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rMJcS"&gt;The 13-megapixel main camera with f/2.2 aperture was surprisingly capable at capturing details in low-light situations. At a recent indoor event with tricky lighting, it had no problems focusing with various light sources in dark rooms, and it managed to photograph small details in the art installations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dfXCY6jPNW5r6UjmjnZ8cazmtg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022110/IMG_20211022_222531879_MP_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the main camera is able to capture fine details even in low light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt1zjg"&gt;Like other smartphone cameras in this class, color accuracy seems to be an issue with the G Pure. Most photos look fine, but there are a few issues, like the pumpkins that look too red with stems that look too blue to be realistic. Likewise, the yellow door should look more orange, and the blue door should look more teal (with more green) than blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWULVm9mnhfqf8fsESdpz8TbjOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021849/IMG_20211016_163007674_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the two doors’ colors are not true to life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3XpYO"&gt;My biggest gripe with the G Pure’s camera is its slider interface for zooming. Unlike other camera apps where you can tap to select the most optimal digital zoom presets, Moto’s zoom slider doesn’t automatically appear in the app. In addition, your hand will probably block your screen as you try to frame your shot and navigate the slider bar at the same time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zCoupo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10870825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BII4oi"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the Moto Pure G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s camera app UI." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0StNfiklM-I1IDQqHb5VdPxkTNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956986/gsin_190209_4806_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure’s zoom slider bar is not as easy to use as other phones’ camera app UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3355Ti"&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUmNa"&gt;At $160 — or less if you catch a sale or carrier deal, as this phone works on many 4G networks in America — it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people looking for a basic budget phone for under $200. After all, it has an all-day battery, a versatile main camera, all in a well-designed, durable package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDQZ0q"&gt;It’s a shame it doesn’t have a faster processor, more RAM, or more onboard storage, which would make it a clear winner. I’d rather Motorola charge a slightly higher price like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;$190 TCL 20SE&lt;/a&gt;, which offers 128GB of internal storage, has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor, and is supported by 4GB of RAM. At least you wouldn’t have to constantly worry about backing up the files from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pmtp8a"&gt;But these issues might not be deal-breakers for more casual users or those with a strict budget. Not many great phones are available at this price point, and the Moto G Pure is quite the catch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD’s powerful 5800X processor is down to its lowest price yet at Newegg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KAhNW9VApZh2DlR9VMRoRsZwUcs=/401x0:4720x2879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159365/AMD_Ryzen_5000_Series_Lidded_5.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team red is at it again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oeNyYz"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-7-5800x%2Fp%2F19-113-665" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AMD Ryzen 7 5800X has been discounted at Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, letting you save up to $75 with the promo code &lt;strong&gt;BFPAYA526&lt;/strong&gt;. This brings the total down to $374, the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular processor. As an added bonus, this CPU comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aaUqF"&gt;The 5800X is part of the latest Zen 3 architecture and uses the same AM4 socket used by AMD's previous generation of processors, which for most people should allow you to swap in this new CPU without having to invest in a new motherboard. This eight-core CPU has a base clock speed of 3.8GHz but is capable of up to a 4.7GHz boost clock speed. While this CPU is quite powerful, Newegg has also discounted the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-9-5900x%2Fp%2F19-113-664" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5900X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-9-5950x%2Fp%2F19-113-663" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5950X&lt;/a&gt; to $524 and $746, respectively, if you’re in need of a processor with a little more staying power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YJrIXh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10870965"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pU9Qh1"&gt;The OnePlus 8T is currently enjoying a sizable $100 discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Version/dp/B08KXB3R7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1lSvSuiQO" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the cost down to $500. Both retailers are offering up the aquamarine (light green) colorway version of the phone. Each comes unlocked with 256GB of storage. While it lacks support for Verizon’s mmWave 5G, it should work with any US carrier’s 4G service, in addition to a limited range of 5G service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acvOJm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; of this phone noted that it was a relatively incremental upgrade to the OnePlus 8, but that it still manages to bring impressive performance and extra perks you usually don’t see at this price, like a silky 120Hz refresh rate display. We’ve seen similar (and sometimes better) deals on this phone recently, so who knows what will come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Black Friday right around the corner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QrspsZ"&gt;Our runner-up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; is the new Bose QC45 wireless, noise-canceling model, and they’ve been discounted to their lowest price ever of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B098FKXT8L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1kpSF1e6c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $329, this week is the first time we’ve seen a price break on these, and it’s a solid value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMd1UZ"&gt;While they look similar to the older QC35 II, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; definitely noticed the improvements made to the overall battery life of these comfy headphones. The QC45 are capable of lasting up to 24 hours on a single charge. And, while they can’t be used when they’re charging, the USB-C support means they can quickly be topped off, with just 15 minutes of charging netting you roughly three hours of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2X2n4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869266"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="onLWgd"&gt;
&lt;p id="AGLoqS"&gt;If you’re looking to expand your PC storage space, this deal on the 1TB WD Black SN750 PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD is for you. It’s currently $150 off the regular MSRP, bringing the total down to $110 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-SN750-NVMe-Internal-Gaming/dp/B07M64QXMN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest price we’ve seen and is an excellent value if you want speedy storage. One quick note, however, is that due to this M.2 drive being PCIe 3.0 and not PCIe 4.0, it’s not advised that you use it with the PlayStation 5, as it likely will not work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EW8jhb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CXkTss"&gt;
&lt;p id="j0xeFy"&gt;If you’re in the market for a large and curvaceous gaming monitor, the big 32-inch version of the &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fmsiom321cqr.html%3F&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MSI Optix series has been discounted at Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to the lowest price we’ve ever seen for this 1440p panel. Capable of up to a 144Hz refresh rate, this monitor also features a 1ms response time and has AMD FreeSync to keep frame rates smooth and reduce screen tearing. The included stand is adjustable, but the monitor has a 100 x 100 VESA mount if you want to use a monitor arm instead. In terms of connectivity, the MAG321CQR can accept HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.2 inputs, and it has a pair of USB ports for connecting or charging peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fGhQC9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EVQ8os"&gt;
&lt;p id="KsReRx"&gt;The stellar Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro wireless gaming mouse is currently discounted to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B08FQMBKQG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price ever. The design of this mouse features four programmable buttons and is ambidextrous (but was made with right-handed gamers in mind). It has a 20K DPI sensor and can operate for up to 120 hours on a single charge, provided you’ve turned off the RGB lighting. This model is compatible with Razer’s mouse dock (sold separately), allowing you to charge it without plugging it in, which beats charging this mouse using the provided Micro USB cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bHQfv7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Ring doorbells will be able to greet people with holiday cheer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiAm6eSgMFne6iS7s8Sc5DJkmqQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159251/dseifert_20210323_4486_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F5zXD1"&gt;Ring is releasing some holiday-themed Quick Replies to add some cheer to its doorbell’s automatic answering feature. Instead of the usual “We can’t answer the door right now, but if you’d like to leave a message, you can do it now” types of messages, you can instead have your Ring greet visitors by saying “We’re busy wrapping presents right now,&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;or have it automatically thank delivery workers for bringing gifts to your door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyy4LX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.ring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056808171-Ring-Quick-Replies-"&gt;According to Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Quick Replies are available on pretty much every Ring doorbell. While the feature is free, you’ll have to be a paying subscriber if you want any visitor responses to your doorbell’s “Happy Holidays!” greeting to be recorded (though you can watch them happen live without a Ring Protect plan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DGj8a"&gt;Like in previous years, you also have the option to set carols like “Deck the Halls,” “Jingle Bells,” or “Oh Hanukkah” as your chime tones, so you can experience getting tired of holiday music by mid-December without leaving home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pEiflI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is spreading holiday cheer more fun than creeping visitors out?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ltvfCs"&gt;Ring seems to be building a collection of holiday-themed Quick Replies and ringtones — earlier this year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708996/rings-halloween-doorbell-ringtones-spooky-quick-replies-arrive"&gt;added spooky ones for Halloween&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I’m hoping there’s eventually a collection for every occasion; maybe you have &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USF55GUALyQ"&gt;a sappy love song&lt;/a&gt; play when someone’s at the door around Valentine’s Day (potentially leading to you realizing that the package delivery person is The One), or have your Ring tell guests to “come back later, we’re responsibly playing with fireworks” on the Fourth of July or New Year’s. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Now subscriptions now come with free Crysis Remastered for PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HV2Ao4fK_RNwotuxxFnvTfWHXn0=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159240/GFN_Thursday_Crysis_Remastered.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zv1jzK"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22725953/crysis-remastered-nvidia-geforce-now-available-streaming"&gt;Nvidia settled the age-old question once and for all&lt;/a&gt; — yes, it can run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;, whatever it is, as long as it can stream the company’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service. To prove it, Nvidia’s now giving away a copy of &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; for free with every new six-month GeForce Now subscription, as well as the first wave of customers who’ve already subscribed or preordered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;GeForce Now’s impressive new RTX 3080 tier&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a limited-time offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcWd8b"&gt;You don’t even have to play that copy of &lt;em&gt;Crysis &lt;/em&gt;using GeForce Now, by the way — it’s a full PC copy delivered via the Epic Games Store, and you can run it on your gaming desktop or laptop too. It’s yours to keep even after your subscription is over. Nvidia says it’s the first time GeForce Now has given away a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNjHs7"&gt;“Current GeForce Now RTX 3080 members will receive game codes in the days ahead; while members who have preordered but haven’t been activated yet, will receive their game code when their GeForce Now RTX 3080 service is activated,” writes Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm9R7y"&gt;It’s worth noting this isn’t the whole &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, just the first game in the series, so we’re talking about a title that currently costs $30 on the Epic Games Store. That’s not necessarily a reason to pick up the service — I’d suggest trying GeForce Now’s free tier to make sure it works for you first — but if you’re already interested in a copy of the game &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; want to become a GFN subscriber, that’s a sizable discount off your six-month, $50 subscription to GeForce Now’s priority tier, or your $100 subscription for six months of the RTX 3080 service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is getting better Battle Pass progression later this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50wvRCkP5eE5HZCF0drb4EN1yk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158973/HaloInfinite_RXJtJxSVSl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urkns2"&gt;If you’re still stuck on level 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass, fear not, as 343 Industries is making some much-needed changes to progression later this week. “To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072"&gt;says &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; community manager John Junyszek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qTANV"&gt;The existing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass makes it difficult to level up, as you’re limited to completing daily or weekly challenges instead of earning XP for every game you play. While that isn’t changing yet, 343 Industries is adding “Play 1 game” challenges “to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want,” according to Junyszek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HF7SN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, we'll be adding "Play 1 Game" challenges to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yId2pq"&gt;343 Industries will also be removing some weekly challenges and fixing bugs with others, but these changes do have a small price. “When we make this update, we’ll need to reset your challenges, including your progress towards weekly ones,” explains Junyszek. “To make up for this reset, we’ll be granting this week’s Ultimate Reward, the Sigil Mark VII Visor, to everyone who logs in from November 23rd to November 30th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhuQBV"&gt;XP boosts will also now double in duration, lasting for an hour instead of 30 minutes, which will help for longer Big Team Battles games. We may even see further changes to the XP and progression systems in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in the future, too. “We’ll be watching these changes closely to make sure they have the positive impact we all want on your progression,” says Junyszek. “This is only our first step - we are committed to continue evolving these systems but it will take time.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XP boost changes should help during Big Team Battles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbrpz"&gt;Criticism around the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass progression has been getting increasingly louder across the community of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans this week after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;surprise early release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While multiplayer previews over the summer felt like an exciting return to form, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725770/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview"&gt;we had concerns around the Battle Pass progression&lt;/a&gt; and XP systems. 343 Industries still went ahead with the same systems, despite concerns from many during the technical previews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uFn2"&gt;It’s encouraging to see quick changes, though. This opening &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; season will last until May, which is double the three months that had originally been promised. That extra time could be why 343 Industries kept the slow Battle Pass progression in the first place, but we’ll have to check out the changes later this week to see if they make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify launches lyrics feature globally for free and paying users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spotify Stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/exXtCaChxrUyyxsLMKiYH1unUEI=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158957/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YEAnqG"&gt;Today, Spotify is finally rolling out its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-18/you-can-now-find-the-lyrics-to-your-favorite-songs-in-spotify-heres-how/"&gt;real-time lyrics feature globally&lt;/a&gt;, after previously only offering it in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307984/spotify-real-time-lyrics-26-markets-musixmatch-genius-apple-music-karaoke"&gt;limited selection of countries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3S2No"&gt;The lyrics themselves are provided by Musixmatch, which claims to &lt;a href="https://about.musixmatch.com/press"&gt;offer lyrics&lt;/a&gt; for “over 8 million” titles. and will be accessible on basically every platform where Spotify has an app. This includes iOS, Android, desktop computers, gaming consoles, and smart TVs. The feature is available to both free and premium listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYNrcO"&gt;As well as using the lyrics to sing along yourself, there’s also a social element which allows you to share lyrics to social media. Spotify says the feature will be available across the “majority” of its music library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANfx4V"&gt;Here’s how to access the lyrics (and share them) as per Spotify’s instructions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FH7wet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Spotify mobile app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cTCiu"&gt;Tap on the “Now Playing View” on a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23MrNs"&gt;While listening, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrGvtb"&gt;You’ll see track lyrics that scroll in real time as the song is playing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rKYKC"&gt;To share, simply tap the “Share” button at the bottom of the lyrics screen and then select the lyrics you want to share — and where you want to share it — via third-party platforms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2efwpu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the Spotify desktop app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYmPaQ"&gt;From the “Now Playing” bar, click on the microphone icon while a song is playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iBJ9c"&gt;Voila! You’ll see track lyrics that scroll in real time while the song plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwQZTP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the SpotifyTV app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Y2PP"&gt;Open the “Now Playing View” on a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zow6SJ"&gt;Navigate to the right corner to the “lyrics button” and select if you want to enable Lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1sj3t"&gt;Once enabled, you’ll see the lyrics in the “Now Playing” View.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fkfXUq"&gt;Spotify’s history with lyrics is complicated. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8113061/spotify-lyrics-feature-desktop-app"&gt;previously worked with Musixmatch&lt;/a&gt; to display song lyrics until &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/lyrics-spotify-musixmatch-gone-for-now/"&gt;parting ways with the company in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, it’s offered a “Behind the Lyrics” feature thanks to a partnership with Genius. It’s an interesting feature that offers background information on songs, but it’s less useful for karaoke sessions. Although it’s offered lyrics in some markets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/29/13103812/spotify-japan-available-lyrics-feature"&gt;like Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the feature hasn’t received a widespread launch in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307984/spotify-real-time-lyrics-26-markets-musixmatch-genius-apple-music-karaoke"&gt;western markets like the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxJ0Ly"&gt;With the introduction of the new lyrics feature, Spotify &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’s discontinuing its “Behind the Lyrics” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
