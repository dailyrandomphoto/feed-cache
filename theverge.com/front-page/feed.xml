    <title>Samsung’s new Galaxy Books include 11th Gen Intel chips and 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book open, angled to the left, on a white background.

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Samsung Galaxy Book.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ooHLD"&gt;Samsung has announced three new additions to its Galaxy Book line: the Galaxy Book, the Galaxy Book Odyssey, and the Galaxy Book Pro 360 5G. While none of the models have features that will knock your socks off, they seem like a natural progression of Samsung’s recent efforts to bring the Galaxy Book line out of the enthusiast space and into the mainstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5lyrX"&gt;The most accessible offering looks to be the regular 15.6-inch Galaxy Book. This is the only one of the three that’s available now; the other two products hit shelves November 11th. I’m currently seeing a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAal6y3RF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$749.99 model&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy that includes a Core i5-1165G7, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage, as well as a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Core i7-1165G7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-15-6-led-touch-screen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-mystic-silver%2F6480610.p%3FskuId%3D6480610&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-15-6-led-touch-screen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-mystic-silver%2F6480610.p%3FskuId%3D6480610&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;16GB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-15-6-led-touch-screen-intel-core-i7-1165g7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-mystic-silver%2F6480610.p%3FskuId%3D6480610&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAaQhLEQb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;/ 512GB configuration&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99. Those seem like reasonable prices to pay for these specs, assuming that the build, keyboard, screen, and other various features are adequate. Given the high quality we tend to see from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419899/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Book line&lt;/a&gt; (particularly when it comes to displays), I’m optimistic there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX2Ec9"&gt;In addition to its price point, the Galaxy Book’s primary calling card seems to be that it’s fairly portable at just 0.61 inches thick (though Samsung hasn’t provided the weight yet). It also has an attractive port selection that includes a nano-SIM and a microSD slot, as well as two USB-C, a USB-A, and an audio jack. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Odyssey on a white background facing forward. The screen displays a blue and black pattern." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQnWE39b1LO06_p953XC0XFQy_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954270/Galaxy_Book_Odyssey___Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Galaxy Book Odyssey. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hX8vea"&gt;Up a few tiers in price is the $1,399 15.6-inch Galaxy Book Odyssey. This is more of a workstation device, configurable with Intel’s H-Series processors as well as Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3050 Ti. At $1,399, it’s certainly a good price for a workstation, though the 3050 Ti is a fairly midrange GPU, and we haven’t been blown away by the results it’s delivered in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more expensive systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6PdT4r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy Book Odyssey starts at $1,399&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ieQLIF"&gt;Also starting at $1,399 is the 13.3-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360 5G. It’s worth noting that the non-5G version of this device &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRAbbTzAQn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starts at $1,009.99&lt;/a&gt;, so while we haven’t seen the specs of the base 5G model yet, it seems likely you’ll be paying a significant premium for the extra connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwXicW"&gt;That said, the 15-inch Galaxy Book Pro impressed when we reviewed it earlier this year. It has a standout screen (which is par for the course in Samsung devices) and excellent battery life. It also ships with Samsung’s S Pen for drawing and note taking, though there’s not a garage to store it in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oid8P3NbIK6AMBDa2TmQEXkOKas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954275/Galaxy_Book_Pro_360_5G___Tab___S_pen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rco3bN"&gt;These all seem refreshingly affordable for their specs, but the Galaxy Book is what I’m most excited about. Its $749 tag is competitive pricing for a line with a history of excellent build quality and gorgeous panels. The ultimate verdict, of course, will depend on how well it ends up performing (and Samsung hasn’t provided the battery size yet). But given how long the Galaxy Book line has been confined to the Samsung-enthusiast space, it’s nice to see it expanding further into the midrange market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkUbRC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cs4WoN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey is now available to download</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQb4FgVLtVz8puPS_k0zaFONLHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042777/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new M1-equipped iMac.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ecyI9B"&gt;The latest version of macOS, Monterey, is now available to download &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/macos-monterey-is-now-available/"&gt;according to Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The software has been available in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;public beta for several months&lt;/a&gt;, but today’s release means Apple thinks the software is ready for everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SrFaF"&gt;As is tradition, Apple announced its latest version of macOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;at WWDC in June&lt;/a&gt;. New features include the ability to set Macs as an AirPlay target to play content from iPhones and iPads, as well as Shortcuts, Apple’s iOS automation software. There have also been improvements made to FaceTime, as well as a new Quick Note feature. For a full rundown of what’s on the way, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;preview from July&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/"&gt;Apple’s own feature list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YQCoeJ"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-925" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s drag-and-drop demo from WWDC 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVJgp8"&gt;Unfortunately, some of Monterey’s biggest new additions, Universal Control and SharePlay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;don’t seem to be available at launch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple notes that both features will be available “&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/features/#:~:text=available%20later%20this%20fall."&gt;later this fall.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82u2wM"&gt;Universal Control allows files to be dragged and dropped between several different machines, as Apple’s Craig Federighi demonstrated at WWDC.  It also will let you control multiple Apple devices including Macs, MacBooks, and iPads, with the same mouse and keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpzQJH"&gt;SharePlay will enable shared experiences of music, TV shows, movies, and more while connected over FaceTime. Once it’s available, Apple says you can use the feature with Apple Music, Apple TV+ and unnamed “popular third-party services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXqmr1"&gt;It’s better news when it comes to Safari’s redesign, which by default now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733357/apple-old-safari-tab-design-macos-monterey"&gt;uses a more traditional interface&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_tragedy_of_safari_15_quote_unquote_tabs"&gt;controversial new tab design&lt;/a&gt; introduced at WWDC. Early users complained that, among other things, the changes made it far too difficult to work out which tab was currently active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKBIgF"&gt;The full list of Macs that can run Monterey can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wVQfix"&gt;iMac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634"&gt;late 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="macCRY"&gt;iMac Pro (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pe2aXs"&gt;Mac Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202888"&gt;late 2013 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EwY30f"&gt;Mac Mini (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201894"&gt;late 2014 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="noB5Y1"&gt;MacBook Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201300"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OB4NQq"&gt;MacBook Air (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201862"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L42eNi"&gt;MacBook (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201608"&gt;early 2016 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx8cXp"&gt;For those keeping track, there are a couple of models that got Big Sur last year that have been left out of the Monterey party. These include the 2015 MacBook, the 2013 MacBook Air, the late 2013 MacBook Pro, and the 2014 iMac. Here’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201581"&gt;Apple’s guide&lt;/a&gt; for identifying your specific model, and here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21287898/apple-macos-updates-automatic-manage-software-catalina-apple-macbook"&gt;ours for updating your machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U4sHG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541"&gt;To install Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Software Update (or search “Software Update” in Spotlight). If Monterey shows up as an available install, you can then click the upgrade button to begin the install process. If it doesn’t show up, you may need to check back in later, as it continues to roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWiS9p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 25th, 1:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information on SharePlay and instructions for how to install Monterey. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This sure looks like Facebook’s rumored Oculus Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWxD16_eVqdKrdSOQ0Dwdzd_dxU=/25x0:775x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042808/Oculus_Pro_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bn0BcR"&gt;Facebook has been teasing work on a pro version of its Oculus Quest headset for quite some time, and now a series of what appear to be setup videos for the unreleased product have leaked from its own servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flF57n"&gt;The videos were first &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/qezcec/this_looks_promising/"&gt;spotted on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend and downloaded from &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2FOculus.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus.com&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and embedded below. They&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;show an unreleased, dark-colored headset being used to customize virtual avatars with what looks like full body tracking, new controllers with a charging dock, and more footage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms app&lt;/a&gt; for work collaboration in VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgcOZ8"&gt;Executives from Facebook have teased the possibility of a pro version of the Oculus Quest for a while, and on October 28th, the company is hosting its annual Connect conference where it usually debuts new VR products. Facebook has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;planning to rebrand its parent company name&lt;/a&gt; to focus more on building its vision of the metaverse, which could use the richer avatars depicted in these videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiLE52"&gt;If Facebook does debut this headset at Connect this week, it would be a reverse from when Andrew Bosworth, VP at Facebook’s Reality Labs, said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391456/oculus-quest-3-pro-timeline-facebook-vr"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that there wasn’t going to be a Quest Pro this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suwKu6"&gt;“We do have a lot of things in development where we want to introduce new functionality to the headset along the kinds that people theorize that we would want to introduce, and that’s a little ways off still,” he said in a Twitter Space conversation with Oculus consulting CTO John Carmack in April. “It’s still not gonna happen this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvdthS"&gt;So there’s a chance that this headset isn’t shown at Connect or that it’s called something else when it does debut, though a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/basti564"&gt;YouTuber who goes by Basti564&lt;/a&gt; told me he found direct references in recent Oculus software to an “Oculus Pro.” He added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/basti564/status/1452412099947270144?s=21"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that, based on where these videos were discovered in the headset’s unreleased firmware, they will play on initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdyQud"&gt;A spokesperson for Oculus declined to comment on the leaked videos below when I asked about them on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 15.1 with SharePlay and more iPhone 13 Pro camera options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uEJLYKONo8IiYe34FuX2ZXR85NI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042748/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C7o5Si"&gt;Apple is releasing iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 today, and the big new feature is SharePlay’s return. SharePlay is a feature that was originally supposed to ship in iOS 15; it lets people call friends or family and watch movies, TV, or listen to music together. SharePlay syncs content so everyone can watch it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARvL9R"&gt;iOS 15.1 also includes some improvements to the camera options for iPhone 13 Pro models. A new Auto Macro toggle for the ‌iPhone 13 Pro‌ is available, allowing you to switch off the automatic macro mode if you find it annoying. ProRes video capture is also available in iOS 15.1, so you can capture even better quality video on an iPhone 13 Pro at 30fps / 1080p on 128GB models or 4K on 256GB models and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAmXnN"&gt;Apple is also enabling iOS 15.1 users to add their COVID vaccine card to the Wallet app, similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558245/google-pay-covid-vaccination-card-android-digital-pass"&gt;Google’s Android version of this feature works&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a HomePod user, iOS 15.1 adds Lossless Audio and Dolby Atmos with Spatial Audio support to the ‌HomePod‌ and the HomePod Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5D6xY"&gt;iOS 15.1 and iPadOS 15.1 are both available now from Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update on compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original iPod ‘prototype’ was an Apple design to prevent leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The original iPod prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2tVXxDlIa4vOZgRTnE3xcDgWeY=/0x44:2560x1751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042659/ipod_prototype_apple.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvaKCn"&gt;It’s hard to believe that the prototype for the original iPod is something that you can’t even fit into your pocket. Panic, a software development group for macOS and iOS, &lt;a href="https://panic.com/blog/a-prototype-original-ipod/"&gt;dredged up the prototype for the original iPod&lt;/a&gt; — something that Apple probably never wanted to see again — in honor of the iPod’s 20th anniversary (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/23/panic-shares-first-look-at-extremely-rare-early-ipod-prototype/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPod prototype size comparison" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O80yYmcgu3tkdsDtXymlT97LbAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953923/ipod_prototype_size_comparison.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Panic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIoxH1"&gt;As funny as it would be if Apple was actually trying to make the iPod look like a failed attempt at a pocket-sized DVD player, that’s (sadly) not the case. A tweet from Tony Fadell, the inventor of the iPod, confirms that the prototype was designed to prevent the real iPod design from getting leaked ahead of its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9M7rpp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a P68/Dulcimer iPod prototype we (very quickly) made before the true form factor design was ready. Didn’t want it look like an iPod for confidentiality - the buttons placement, the size - it was mostly air inside - and the wheel worked (poorly) &lt;a href="https://t.co/qeNMHMmVsc"&gt;https://t.co/qeNMHMmVsc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tony Fadell (@tfadell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/1451969239359926276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQFoZA"&gt;The yellow, brick-like device is dated September 3rd, 2001, almost two months before the iPod’s actual release date on October 23rd. The prototype is several times larger than the iPod we all know and love and has a scroll wheel in its top-left corner, along with a tiny screen in the top-right. Other clunky navigation buttons line the side of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhlY6x"&gt;Apple’s mission to conceal its design is also the reason behind the massive amount of space on the inside of the device. The layout of its internals is closer to the size of the official iPod, but Apple just decided to give it a clunky get-up to hide its design secrets, both on the inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGRNMX"&gt;We’ve seen other Apple prototypes in the past, but nothing looks as silly as this. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/25/14737526/second-generation-ipod-prototype-ebay"&gt;second-generation iPod popped up on eBay&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and the seller wanted nearly $100,000. Even &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/28/the-story-behind-a-rare-1st-generation-ipod-touch-prototype-that-still-runs-os-x-gallery/"&gt;the iPod Touch prototype&lt;/a&gt; looks close to the finished product. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738419/apple-videopad-auction-steve-jobs-bonhams-prototype"&gt;a prototype for the never-released VideoPad 2&lt;/a&gt; popped up and is set to be auctioned off in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4CMd3"&gt;The original iPod prototype, however, is definitely one of a kind. It’s a testament to Apple’s dedication to keeping its design classified, which was especially important for the launch of its very first iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lwwbb"&gt;Mastercard has signed a deal with cryptocurrency firm Bakkt to make crypto options available to merchants and banks across its payments network, the company &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/october/mastercard-and-bakkt-partner-to-offer-innovative-crypto-and-loyalty-solutions/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Monday. The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/mastercard-says-any-bank-or-merchant-on-its-vast-network-can-soon-offer-crypto-services.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXH5Di"&gt;Banks on Mastercard’s global payments network will be able to provide cryptocurrency rewards on credit and debit cards, for example, and reward points on purchases like airlines or hotels can be paid out in cryptocurrency. Consumers will be able to convert their crypto holdings to pay for purchases and hold digital assets through custodial wallets on Bakkt’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGYA6I"&gt;Mastercard &lt;a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/"&gt;said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; it would start allowing its cardholders to conduct some transactions on specific cryptocurrencies on its network, and it said in July it was working with crypto and digital asset startups as part of its effort to make cryptocurrencies more widely used by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw7V0i"&gt;The deal with Bakkt, which began publicly trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 18th, could significantly expand access to and adoption of cryptocurrencies; the company says there are presently more than 2.8 billion active Mastercards and more than 22,000 banks and financial institutions on its network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9llKg"&gt;“Together with Bakkt and grounded by our principled approach to innovation, we’ll not only empower our partners to offer a dynamic mix of digital assets options, but also deliver differentiated and relevant consumer experiences,” Sherri Haymond, executive vice president of digital partnerships at Mastercard, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5uHDz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin reveals plans for future commercial space station called Orbital Reef</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI5xQCAUmG2-P5gS7UTPkyGXI3g=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042426/Orbital_Reef_Underneath.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of Orbital Reef with one of Boeing’s Starliner vehicles visiting.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PODr3q"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight venture Blue Origin announced plans to build its own free-flying space station today. Called Orbital Reef, the future space station will begin operating in the second half of this decade, according to Blue Origin, providing a place for researchers, industrial and commercial customers, and international partners to visit and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAIzA7"&gt;Blue Origin is working on the Orbital Reef project in partnership with spaceflight company Sierra Space, a subsidiary of the Sierra Nevada Corporation. Sierra Space’s most well-known project is the Dream Chaser, a winged spaceplane designed to carry cargo — and perhaps people one day — to the International Space Station. Dream Chaser is scheduled to begin cargo flights in 2022. Blue Origin says that Orbital Reef also has the backing of additional spaceflight teammates, including industry heavyweight Boeing, as well as Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering Solutions, and Arizona State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WASOsb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Orbital Reef will be able to house up to 10 people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cu3Ouv"&gt;With an internal volume nearly as large as the International Space Station’s, Orbital Reef will be able to house up to 10 people, with separate areas for living and conducting science, according to Blue Origin. The company claims that Orbital Reef will be a “mixed-use business park” in space that will have multiple ports and berths for visiting spacecraft and modules, along with various utilities and amenities. Blue Origin boasts that the space station will have an “open system architecture” that will allow a variety of people and customers to use the facility. A list of possible users included space agencies, media and travel companies, entrepreneurs and investors, tech companies, and more, according to Blue Origin. Blue Origin also claims that it will provide “end-to-end” services for anyone wishing to use the station, from transportation, leasing space, technological assistance with hardware, and robotic services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XtcccWKvUC4XqJX6d6t7jggGrI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953972/Orbital_Reef_Outside_Windows.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FYPhrY"&gt;“As the premier commercial destination in low Earth orbit, Orbital Reef will provide the essential infrastructure needed to scale economic activity and open new markets in space,” Blue Origin writes in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g8Iue"&gt;During a press conference, Blue Origin and its teammates refused to detail how much the space station would cost, nor would they say how much investment each of the partners would provide for the project. “The question you’re asking is part of our business case and not going to give you a specific number,” Brent Sherwood, senior vice president of advanced development programs for Blue Origin, said when asked about the total cost of Orbital Reef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVKZRL"&gt;The companies said they envision that Boeing’s new Starliner spacecraft and Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser would provide human and cargo transport to Orbital Reef. Dream Chaser has yet to fly, and Starliner has not flown people to orbit yet. The plan is to also launch most of Orbital Reef’s modules on Blue Origin’s future New Glenn rocket — another rocket that hasn’t flown yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY83ns"&gt;It’s possible that smaller pieces of the station could fly on other commercial rockets. “The large volume modules and systems that Blue Origin is building are optimized for New Glenn’s diameter and throw capacity,” Sherwood said. “Some of the elements are smaller and could launch on other systems as well, but a nominal point of departure plan is that all of these will launch on New Glenn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bINuwJ"&gt;Blue Origin has &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-considers-entering-commercial-space-station-business/"&gt;dropped hints in the past&lt;/a&gt; of its plans to potentially build a space station, and NASA is providing incentives for companies to pursue such projects. This year, NASA &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-offer-funding-for-initial-studies-of-commercial-space-stations/"&gt;announced the creation of a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; called the Commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Development — or CLD — program. The goal is to provide spaceflight companies with money to help jumpstart the development of private space stations that NASA could visit one day. NASA plans to award up to $400 million through two to four Space Act Agreements to fund initial studies of these space stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="90APST"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Blue Origin has dropped hints in the past of plans to build a space station&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QYUxTO"&gt;The CLD program is just one step in NASA’s long-term plan to eventually phase out the government-run International Space Station and transition to the use of commercial space stations. Currently, the ISS is slated to continue operating through 2024, and NASA has been eyeing an extension of the program through 2028. But the ISS is expensive, costing NASA $3 to $4 billion to operate each year, and the decades-old station can’t last forever. Eventually, NASA wants to retire the station and fill low Earth orbit — the domain of the ISS — with company-run space stations, as NASA focuses its human spaceflight efforts on deep space destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr6htj"&gt;In September, NASA claimed &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/20/nasa-evaluating-private-space-station-proposals-for-iss-replacement.html"&gt;it got about a dozen proposals for the initiative&lt;/a&gt;. “We got an incredibly strong response from industry to our announcement for proposals for commercial, free fliers that go directly to orbit,” Phil McAlister, the director of commercial spaceflight at NASA, told CNBC. “I can’t remember the last time we got that many proposals [in response] to a [human spaceflight] contract announcement.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3i8U0evYb82pTpq77OH_CCOBCGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953975/Orbital_Reef_Interior_Core.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ASVzXm"&gt;NASA leadership has been considering this kind of future for many years. NASA already holds a contract with one company, Axiom, to develop a private space station that can dock with the ISS as part of a previous space agency initiative called NextSTEP. Axiom plans for this docked space station to be a precursor to a free-flying space station sometime later. Blue Origin claimed at today’s press conference that NASA has indicated that it plans to be an “anchor tenant” of Orbital Reef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cueP42"&gt;Right now, Blue Origin’s only operational spaceflight project is New Shepard, a suborbital tourist rocket designed to send paying customers to the edge of space and back. So far, the company has flown eight people to space on New Shepard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;including Bezos, Blue Origin’s founder&lt;/a&gt;. Other projects in development include New Glenn, a rocket designed to take cargo and people to orbit, as well as Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could take humans to the Moon’s surface. Neither of those projects has been completed yet. Blue Origin hoped to win a contract with NASA to develop Blue Moon for the agency’s Artemis program — an initiative to send humans back to the lunar surface — but the company ultimately lost out to rival SpaceX. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;Blue Origin filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Federal Claims&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to receive NASA funding for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2ZwKt"&gt;Meanwhile, Blue Origin is grappling with its own internal strife. This month, nearly two dozen current and former employees at the company wrote an essay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;claiming that Blue Origin’s culture is toxic and unsafe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJVBXO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 25th, 1:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated to include details from a press conference announcing the project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new regular AirPods get a lot right even before the gimmicky spatial audio part&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYTlYX"&gt;For the first time since their introduction in 2016, Apple’s AirPods have a completely new design. The third-generation AirPods, priced at $179, bear a much closer resemblance to the AirPods Pro than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;long-stemmed original&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-gen pairs&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has upgraded their sound, added new features like spatial audio head tracking, made them more durable with IPX4 water resistance, and lengthened their battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFDLaT"&gt;What remains unchanged about the AirPods is their ease of use and deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. If you’re living in Apple’s world, you still get exclusive features like the intuitive, just-hold-them-near-your-iPhone setup, audio sharing, automatic device switching, and other software tricks that have helped the AirPods stay atop the true wireless earbuds market by a wide margin. The third-generation AirPods also gain more extensive Find My support to help you locate them if they go missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup0oN"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max didn’t even exist the last time Apple refreshed its standard AirPods. So the third-gen earbuds also establish more feature parity across the entire lineup. There are definitely still reasons to pick those products instead — active noise cancellation, namely — but anyone who’s ready to upgrade their original AirPods will find a lot to like with the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWOCkg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10826364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="444ptP"&gt;These AirPods basically look like the AirPods Pro with their ear tips chopped off. They share similar contours, especially now that Apple has shortened the stems by 33 percent. There are also grilled black speakers, mics, and vents around each earbud. These hardware elements have become so prominent that I’m surprised Apple isn’t offering the new AirPods in black to help camouflage them. But nope: they still only come in white. Since their design is now so similar, Apple carried over the “force sensor” controls from the AirPods Pro, with an indent on each stem that designates where to press. The tap gestures from the old AirPods are gone. Apple’s non-remappable controls handle media playback, and you can summon Siri with a long press. But you’ve also got hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands at your disposal for adjusting volume or changing up the playlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfbDUX"&gt;Unlike the Pros, there are no silicone ear tips for a customizable fit: as with its previous standard AirPods, Apple sticks with a one-size-fits-most hard plastic design. They’re open-style earbuds that rest in your ears instead of extending deep into the ear canal. A lot of people love the barely there comfort of the AirPods. The main side effect of their open design is that they let in a ton of outside noise. For me, that’s always been a significant turnoff. But again, others value having the added awareness — be it for personal safety reasons or otherwise — and view this as an upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOF4UNksPfsgjJRt-H2qZmI9HNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953794/IMG_0048_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods (below) are clearly cut from the same cloth as the AirPods Pro (above).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="die3Jr"&gt;Unfortunately, fit is where the old AirPods have always let me down. They just weren’t a good match for my large-ish ears and would come loose and fall out way too easily. All ears are different, and I know a ton of people who had no such issues. But I was expecting another round of disappointment when I put the third-gen AirPods into my ears for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBcM1"&gt;Fortunately, the new shape fits my ears much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFVPQU"&gt;Apple says it conducted a ton of user research when designing the third-generation AirPods, involving thousands of ear scans, heat maps, and so on. And at least in my case, something about the new shape definitely works better. They’re staying put so well that I no longer feel the same anxiety about them tumbling onto the ground and down a sewer grate. That worry was always present with the older AirPods. The healthy dose of ambient sound remains, and I’m just someone who prefers earbuds that offer some quiet from the outside world. But I can finally say that Apple’s regular AirPods fit me, and that was never true previously. If you had issues with the original design, it’s worth giving these a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woYRg7Y4GOzAoeIkIMHF92IN-90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953799/IMG_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new AirPods have much shorter stems than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBojuP"&gt;The charging case now opens in landscape — just like the case for the AirPods Pro — but it’s noticeably smaller than that one. It’s closer in overall size to the original AirPods case, though a smidge thicker. The case still has a Lightning port for wired charging, and it also supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers. Apple says the new AirPods case is designed to work with the company’s MagSafe chargers. And sure enough, it grabs onto the circular MagSafe charging pad with the same perfect alignment as an iPhone 12 or 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nISprs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the old AirPods never fit your ears, these might do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8V0LTd"&gt;But don’t expect to charge your earbuds by placing them on the back of Apple’s MagSafe-ready iPhones: there’s no reverse wireless charging. And to drive that point home, Apple told me it intentionally designed the AirPods case so that it doesn’t magnetically latch onto the back of those phones. You’ll feel some pull when sliding the case around the back of the phone, but it’s nowhere near enough force to keep the two attached. As for the actual battery life, Apple says the third-gen AirPods can hit six hours of continuous playback and a total of 30 hours counting case recharges. That’s a modest improvement over the five hours and “over 24 hours” estimates from the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiGbOD"&gt;Both the AirPods and their case are now rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Plenty of people used the older generations for workouts, but the official certification gives added peace of mind if you’ll frequently be using these AirPods as a gym companion. There’s also a new “skin detection sensor” on each earbud that replaces the old IR sensor. It still tells the AirPods to pause when removed from your ears (or resume when placed back in), but Apple says this sensor can tell the difference between your ears or tight spaces like a pants pocket that might’ve fooled the previous AirPods into resuming playback if you put them in there without the case. It’s not difficult to envision future evolutions of this sensor tying into Apple’s health and fitness efforts. But for now it’s just there to make auto-pause more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFY7Ex"&gt;Apple has completely redesigned the acoustic driver and amplifier in the third-gen AirPods. The company told me it aimed to give them a sound profile similar to the AirPods Pro. There’s only so much you can do with open-style earbuds to improve bass performance; these will never pack the same low-end punch as many upscale in-ear buds. But the new AirPods do sound noticeably fuller and more dynamic than their predecessors — and yes, very similar to the Pros. In the right ways, they still sound like AirPods, and they’re tuned to work equally well for music, watching videos, podcasts, games, and so on. But Apple says music is still far and away the leading thing people use their AirPods for, so it’s trying to deliver the best audio quality possible in this form factor. I’ve found that the open design often leads to a more spacious soundstage. The AirPods are still handily outperformed by top-tier earbuds like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but among other buds with an open design, they’re up there with the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK-mSuFuVOg5iUNkHQdRI1SwPYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953803/IMG_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods have redesigned drivers and support spatial audio with head tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lfClhR"&gt;To further enhance their sound, the new AirPods use the same adaptive EQ feature as the Pros and Max. There’s an inward-facing mic on each earbud that analyzes what you’re hearing and, so Apple claims, adjusts the output in real time to what’s best for your unique ear shape. But the thing about adaptive EQ is that it’s impossible to ever really know when it’s doing something — or what that something is. It’s invisible to the listener at all times, so there’s not much to say about it. There’s no telling whether the improved sound is due to the redesigned drivers, the inclusion of adaptive EQ, or a combination of both. The third-gen AirPods do a better job of steering audio into your ears, which also helps achieve that full-bodied sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPpQJ6"&gt;But that brings us to the big trick Apple is advertising with the new AirPods: spatial audio with head tracking. Like the AirPods Pro and Max, the third-gen pair can dynamically adjust the sound in each earbud as you turn your head from side to side, keeping the sound source anchored to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV you’re watching. When you’re watching movies in Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, or other popular apps, this head tracking can be an immersive, fun experience and mimics surround sound better than a regular stereo mix would. It really does add to the satisfaction of watching movies on my iPad Pro. And for those times when someone’s asleep at home and you can’t take advantage of your soundbar or surround system on the Apple TV, you can listen in private with AirPods and spatial audio head tracking. Apple has also thought of other use cases: on group FaceTime calls, spatial audio creates a sound field that places the voices where they’re positioned on your device’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HUXc0F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still in the early days of spatial audio — and you can tell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="683JZk"&gt;But when it comes to music, it all feels far more gimmicky. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;I’ve written about Apple Music’s Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; before, and everything there applies here. The feature works with all headphones, but only the third-gen AirPods, Pros, and Max add head tracking to the equation. That doesn’t really change where I stand on it. Spatial audio mixes can often sound objectively worse than their stereo counterparts. It takes a lot of work from engineers and producers to get the most from Atmos, and it remains obvious that a lot of albums available in spatial audio on Apple Music haven’t gotten that level of attention. Instruments and effects can sound out of place, vocals can get drowned out in the mix, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1oiF2"&gt;The situation is improving as newer records are mixed for Atmos from the get-go. (And Atmos mixes do generally sound a lot better on actual Atmos home theater systems.) The recent Giles Martin remix of &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt; by The Beatles takes advantage of spatial audio well without trying to do too much. It has that feeling of being in the room with the band. But other examples, like Kacey Musgraves’ &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, don’t do anything for me that I don’t already get from the stereo version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrGfV"&gt;In short, spatial audio can wow when it comes to video, but we’re still in the very early stages of the music side — and it’s not a reason to buy these earbuds yet. Apple makes it easy to switch back and forth between spatial audio and regular sound in Control Center. And iOS 15 actually lets you “spatialize” sound from apps like Spotify that don’t otherwise offer the feature. I guess that’s nice to have if you really find yourself loving this new way of listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W73EEHXIiB114uTu-QbiD6XBZUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953861/IMG_0049_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like all AirPods before them, the third-gen earbuds are positioned as the perfect iPhone accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGJmS"&gt;The AirPods have long been the champion of voice calls, and with the third-gen set, Apple is trying to improve the fidelity of FaceTime calls by using a new AAC-ELD codec for clearer voice reproduction. There’s also acoustic mesh on the outward-facing side of each AirPod that’s meant to reduce wind noise. Despite the shorter stems, overall microphone performance remains excellent and the new AirPods remain easy to recommend if you want earbuds that guarantee you’ll come through clearly on calls. Stay tuned for our video review for the full mic test — with Becca, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1Vctld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10826383"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Oafy"&gt;Apple has also given the new AirPods a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;deeper level of integration with its Find My app&lt;/a&gt;. You could always play a sound to find a missing (nearby) earbud or see the location where they were last connected to your phone. But now the third-gen AirPods get the same “find nearby” feature as the AirPods Pro and Max. This is an AirTags-like interface for pinpointing where the AirPods are if you’re in close proximity to them. It’s not as accurate as an AirTag, but the UI will tell you when the AirPods are “nearby” and then show “here” when you’re right near them. If they’re really nowhere to be found, you can also now enable lost mode and be alerted if your missing AirPods come within range of millions of other iOS devices. My favorite of the new Find My features are the separation alerts that automatically pop up if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. That alone should prevent a lot of heartbreak and lost earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aimgs"&gt;The new AirPods are the first big redesign of Apple’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. From a fit and comfort standpoint, I think Apple succeeded: these are still wonderfully lightweight earbuds, and they actually stay in my ears now. The sound quality has seen some refinement, and the third-gen AirPods are a better gym buddy than their predecessors. Plus you’ve got longer battery life and nice-to-have features like spatial audio head tracking — even if Apple is overselling it a bit. I’ll personally be sticking with the AirPods Pro and other earbuds that offer noise cancellation or at least some isolation. But if you prefer the open-style AirPods and have an older pair that can’t hold a charge anymore, these are a worthwhile upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Y3dZlM"&gt;But before you go getting locked deeper into Apple’s ecosystem, it’s worth exploring your options. The game has changed a lot since the second-gen AirPods were released, and it’s possible to find better sound quality among competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and others. If you can do without the frills, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;spend much less and still be happy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, if you’ve got an iPhone, none of those can deliver the same seamless experience as the AirPods. They’re still designed to perfectly complement Apple’s smartphone, and in that regard they don’t disappoint. Perhaps more than any other Apple product today, AirPods still just work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHo33xg_dwJugv7qha5Ofl2OST0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042241/acastro_211024_4822_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BwFlxl"&gt;For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;beginning in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlTwmg"&gt;The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrgxMl"&gt;We’ve already done &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743753/facebook-tier-list-countries-leaked-documents-content-moderation"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="95KZrK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uXrltV"&gt;Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580620/biden-facebook-vaccine-misinformation-platforms"&gt;accused the platform of “killing people”&lt;/a&gt; by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCJ6fW"&gt;(Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIRvUo"&gt;“Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nNomp2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3ak7N"&gt;The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRUps8"&gt;The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. &lt;a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/articles/vaccine-misinformation-in-facebook-comment-sections-a-case-study/"&gt;A First Draft News study in May&lt;/a&gt; looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwI6AD"&gt;The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvzslW"&gt;Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cC6Red"&gt;Another document published &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21081616-copy-of-copy-of-covid-workstream-1-week-update_sanitized"&gt;shortly after April 2021&lt;/a&gt; shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cl0Tf"&gt;Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736301/facebook-demote-groups-content-policy-violations-update"&gt;new downranking rules from just last week&lt;/a&gt;. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="65ZogJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9sAQx3"&gt;Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21091528-apple-escalation-how-we-made-it-through-this-sev_sanitized_opt"&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt;, referenced briefly by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38ESNh"&gt;Apple had been tipped off by &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50228549"&gt;a BBC News Arabic report&lt;/a&gt; that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="O29NG7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ee0Ma"&gt;Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUfoiq"&gt;After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBXrmh"&gt;Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lea8mb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3TQpnb"&gt;One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;/a&gt; on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSLPUM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-whistle-blower-files-reveal-internal-struggle-profit-vs-public-safety?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; explores the issue in more detail&lt;/a&gt;, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcNybN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/25/facebook-employees-message-anguish-517012"&gt;highlights another employee quote&lt;/a&gt; showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YftFai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jmnXdq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21091529-querdunken-experiment_sanitized"&gt;Another document&lt;/a&gt; details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UfIPl"&gt;As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qjPIYc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EN0Mjr"&gt;Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/covid19/2021/09/29/querdenken-the-german-anti-lockdown-movement-that-thrives-on-public-distrust/"&gt;similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon&lt;/a&gt;. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdmviS"&gt;The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/removing-new-types-of-harmful-networks/"&gt;announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,&lt;/a&gt;” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9yoom"&gt;Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g2e5A7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa9cla"&gt;Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kudeCD"&gt;Reports &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/25/facebook-jan-6-election-claims-516997"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; outline&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pGgwFx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dOxXmo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; first revealed&lt;/a&gt; that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joe2X7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21091530-ranking-for-civic-health_sanitized"&gt;In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,”&lt;/a&gt; Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wLT5B7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ih0o6u"&gt;The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics.  “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcPvpx"&gt;Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0PSEr"&gt;The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QeoSTY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s8u9SY"&gt;A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZyeIJ"&gt;A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAk94x"&gt;Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xj934V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TsjsfE"&gt;In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21091531-sev-civic-non-recommendable-groups_sanitized"&gt;an internal document&lt;/a&gt; gives us new insight into why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT8Fey"&gt;The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="29K2qF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IzVNdd"&gt;“Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llez64"&gt;It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/06/24/after-repeatedly-promising-not-to-facebook-keeps-recommending-political-groups-to-its-users"&gt;that January&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/06/24/after-repeatedly-promising-not-to-facebook-keeps-recommending-political-groups-to-its-users"&gt;again in June&lt;/a&gt;. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDxCI6"&gt;But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content.  The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob7CVb"&gt;According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjLH2B"&gt;There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="08qHZ8"&gt;But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Mqex8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTmiAh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s infamous Craig gets a glow-up in latest campaign trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-Gc_AcOBc4XSB3KhL0O2OCr_dY=/139x0:1125x657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70042122/craig.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vSnDrE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744558/halo-infinite-campaign-overview-preview-trailer-master-chief-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s new campaign trailer&lt;/a&gt; showcased all the Banished-beating activities the Master Chief will get up to while exploring the mysterious Zeta Halo ring. Hidden among the updates is a neat little callback to the game’s first infamous trailer, featuring a new face on an old friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RsdxR"&gt;Craig The Brute is back and he’s had some work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J2DF7O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10826282"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2CiLz"&gt;Craig became the &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/craig-from-halo-infinite-is-the-new-xbox-mascot-jokes-xbox-chief"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; meme&lt;/a&gt; back when Microsoft debuted an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;eight-minute demo&lt;/a&gt; highlighting &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign and gameplay. Fans picked the demo apart, lambasting it for its seemingly poor-quality graphics that Craig — the name given to the brute enemy looking extremely nonplussed that the Master Chief is trying to bash his face in — came to represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CIXUU"&gt;In the new trailer, that’s not the Craig but it is a brute enemy. Since all brutes mostly look the same, it’s safe to say Craig and all his brothers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;took some time off&lt;/a&gt; to work on themselves, practice a little self-care, and grow a pandemic beard. However, not everyone used their time wisely as Nu!Craig still doesn’t seem bothered by the Master Chief’s right hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jr6naS"&gt;The reaction to the new trailer has been positive and fans have noticed the graphical improvements. However, not everything shown off represents what we’ll see at launch. When a fan noticed the update to the Escharum enemy at the end of the trailer, a 343 Industries employee was quick to point out that wasn’t an in-engine render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n66XgL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey Rhys - just to clear up confusion and set expectations, the Escharum on the left is not in-engine. Keep your eyes peeled for more on both  &lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1452625175371915292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1TjaAk"&gt;We’ll see more of Craig’s luscious new beard when &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launches December 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeWExk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
