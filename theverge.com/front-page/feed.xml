    <title>Latest iOS beta lets you manually scan for sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlpL7ZBOcfluDDeusfpsZTsseOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121343/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTags were released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkeFzN"&gt;Among the features added to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/09/new-features-in-ios-15-beta-2/"&gt;iOS 15.2’s second beta&lt;/a&gt; is a new option in the Find My app that lets you manually scan your surroundings for AirTags and other Find My-enabled devices that someone might be using to track you. The feature, which is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"&gt;detailed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is accessible via a new “Items That Can Track Me” option listed in the Find My app’s Items menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a5TOm"&gt;Hit the link, and the app will report if there are any devices nearby that aren’t owned by you and which have Apple’s tracking technology enabled. The app can then give instructions on how to disable the device. Alternatively, there’s a “Help Return Lost Items” option for items that have ended up in your vicinity accidentally rather than maliciously, which replaces the previous “Identify Found Item” text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAfBVZs-g2ti8bb7fk-Yq0K34DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002055/apple_unknown_items_scan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is accessible from the “Items That Can Track Me” menu item.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45ZZxa"&gt;AirTags are designed to let you keep track of items like keys or a bike in case they’re lost or stolen. The new beta feature is Apple’s latest attempt to assuage critics &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review"&gt;who quickly pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny AirTags are &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;pretty good at tracking people and identified some shortcomings in the safety features Apple included at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHA2fa"&gt;In June, Apple announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;initial series of measures&lt;/a&gt; to address these concerns. So rather than waiting until an AirTag had spent three whole days away from its owner before emitting a warning chime, AirTags now do so after just eight to 24 hours. Apple also announced that it is building an app for Android users to alert them to the presence of unwanted trackers and said that it would be launching later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjZ5xN"&gt;Other tweaks that have arrived with iOS 15.2’s second beta include the introduction of the Legacy Contact feature Apple announced at WWDC 2021, which lets loved ones access your account and personal information in the event of your death. The &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;Communication Safety feature for the Messages app is also returning&lt;/a&gt;, although it now won’t notify a parent when nudity is detected in an image. It’ll just blur the image and offer safety resources. There’s also a new Hide My Email option in the mail app, and the interface of the Apple TV app has been tweaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ERa1d"&gt;As with every iOS beta, however, there’s always that chance that any one of these features may be tweaked or removed entirely before its stable release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android users get another app-based Google TV remote option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdrK1V7r-Xk36MHFjHX3YkPhWKk=/0x38:3800x2571/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70120999/image__6_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote interface featuring a large touchpad and shortcut buttons.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MamqWM"&gt;Google has updated its Google Home Android app to add a built-in remote for Android TV, Google TV, and other devices like the Nvidia Shield. The feature, which was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/09/google-home-android-tv-remote/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a helpful option if you misplace a physical remote control. To use it, head to the page in the Google Home app for the device you want to control, and then tap “Open remote” in the bottom left corner of the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CarEux"&gt;Although the Google Home remote feature is only available on Android for now, its eventual &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/11/google-home-android-tv-remote-app/"&gt;launch on iOS&lt;/a&gt; has the potential to be the far more useful addition. That’s because Android users already have the option of using a similar software remote via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;the Google TV app&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9083864?hl=en"&gt;remote tile in quick settings&lt;/a&gt;. iOS users, meanwhile, don’t get access to these same convenient features. Unfortunately Google is yet to announce when the new Google Home remote feature will arrive on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WX8haG5mRolc_RAJ6n1CdA5nn_c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001974/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote also features an onscreen keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LoXxY5"&gt;Navigation involves swiping across a large touchpad interface rather than tapping on a D-pad, and there are buttons below the touchpad to replicate a physical remote’s back, home, and Google Assistant shortcut buttons. There is also a button to turn a TV on and off and we saw volume and mute buttons appear when using the remote to control an Android TV-based projector. Similarly, a keyboard automatically appears when prompted to enter login credentials, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZw0cD"&gt;None of this will be revolutionary for Android users, but it bodes well for iOS users when the functionality eventually arrives in Google Home’s iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InVgTT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg2pDD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google loses key appeal against €2.4 billion EU shopping antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBBl1sSCAxqWuRqV_vywKq6FMi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70120920/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OeFrkn"&gt;The EU’s second-most senior court, the General Court, has &lt;a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-11/cp210197en.pdf"&gt;upheld a 2017 ruling&lt;/a&gt; by the European Commission which found that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/27/15872354/google-eu-fine-antitrust-shopping"&gt;broke antitrust law&lt;/a&gt; in how it used its search engine to promote its shopping comparison service and demote those of its rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stxOLE"&gt;Google and its parent company Alphabet appealed the decision, but the General Court today dismissed that appeal and upheld a fine of €2.4 billion ($2.8 billion). Google and Alphabet now have the option to appeal the decision yet again with the EU’s highest court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K9TzNy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is one of three antitrust cases pursued against Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xfcpxt"&gt;This outcome is significant as it strengthens antitrust arguments made by the EU’s influential competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager against US tech firms. In addition to this shopping comparison case, Google has been hit by two other major antitrust cases involving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18270891/google-eu-antitrust-fine-adsense-advertising"&gt;AdSense&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and 2019 respectively. These cases are now going through a similar appeal process to the one Google lost today with Google Shopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbbrTi"&gt;Key to Vestager’s legal argument in this and other antitrust cases is the concept of “self-preferencing” — the idea that a company like Google can break antitrust law by using a dominant position in one market (in Google’s case, search) to help it succeed in another (in this case, shopping). Self-preferencing is not itself a breach of EU antitrust law, but its potential harmful effects — like stifling better products made by rivals — are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YKHjY"&gt;In its judgement today, the EU’s General Court said it had seen enough evidence that Google’s behavior in this area was harmful. The company, said the court, had broken antitrust law “by favouring its own comparison shopping service on its general results pages through more favourable display and positioning, while relegating the results from competing comparison services in those pages by means of ranking algorithms.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wx0ega"&gt;Because self-preferencing is common in the tech world — with companies often achieving scale by focusing on a single product before branching out to neighboring services — this judgement will strengthen other antitrust arguments made by the EU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oxoXuJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today’s judgment gives the European Commission the ammunition it needs to tighten the screws on Google”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEIjif"&gt;“Today’s judgment gives the European Commission the ammunition it needs to tighten the screws on Google in other areas where it is throwing its weight around, like in online advertising, app stores and video streaming,” said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel for FairSearch, an industry association of Google competitors, in a press statement. “This victory is only the first step.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoVRAq"&gt;However, despite celebration by Google’s rivals, the case also shows the extreme limitations in the EU’s ability to actually tackle antitrust cases in the tech world. The original complaint in this case was filed more than a decade ago in 2009, and today’s decision may not even be the final judgement if Google and Alphabet decide to appeal with the ECJ. In response to the 2017 judgement, Google did make changes to its business model, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-eu-google-antitrust-idUSKCN1C22B4"&gt;allowing rivals to bid to appear&lt;/a&gt; in its shopping search results, but rivals said this just created a new revenue stream for the company without addressing Google’s underlying advantage. Between the slow decision-making process and the perceived inadequacy of Google’s changes by its rivals, many will wonder if the EU’s antitrust work is really worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqgkYk"&gt;Meanwhile, antitrust advocates in the EU are already shifting their focus to the bloc’s next big legislative proposal to level the playing field with US tech firms: the &lt;a href="https://voxeu.org/article/european-commission-digital-markets-act-translation"&gt;Digital Markets Act&lt;/a&gt;, or DMA. This act was proposed by the European Commission in December 2020, and would force tech platforms to make new concessions to smaller rivals. However, even if the DMA is approved by the EU’s legislators, it wouldn’t be implemented until 2023 at the earliest. Speed is certainly not in the EU’s nature.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grand Theft Auto remaster gameplay footage leaks online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5SO_3Zpk2d5F3lrJxcROA1qJFL4=/0x0:2157x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70120864/IkRyV0x71x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UI will look familiar to anyone who’s played the original games.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0mTE0Q"&gt;Gameplay footage from Rockstar’s upcoming remaster of its PS2-era Grand Theft Auto trilogy has appeared online, after gameplay footage was apparently uploaded from early copies. &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/over-an-hour-of-gta-trilogy-gameplay-footage-has-leaked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC &lt;/em&gt;has collected together&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk706HvkZlU&amp;amp;t=2s"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyWXkvH207s"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE5c6jZpvSA"&gt;uploads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTATrilogy/comments/qqnh2d/gameplay/?utm_term=1616885797&amp;amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;amp;utm_source=embed&amp;amp;utm_name=&amp;amp;utm_content=header"&gt;one Reddit post&lt;/a&gt;, which between them show over an hour of footage of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg0YjU"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition &lt;/em&gt;is just one day away from release, Rockstar hasn’t shared any substantial gameplay footage from the remastered games. A trailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22739195/remastered-grand-theft-auto-trilogy-release-date-november-11th-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas"&gt;released last month&lt;/a&gt; focused almost exclusively on cutscenes from the three games rather than the gameplay enhancements Rockstar is promising for the almost two-decade-old trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkuRL2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5c6jZpvSA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sa5Y3h"&gt;But these leaked gameplay clips give a much better idea of how these remasters will actually play. They show off the games’ new weapon selection wheel UI, which they’ve inherited from later &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; games, and give an idea of how the &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;-inspired controls actually work in practice. One of the &lt;em&gt;Vice City &lt;/em&gt;clips appears to include footage of the player activating a cheat code and spawning in a tank (check it out from roughly the 16:10 mark below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4fZwjQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pyWXkvH207s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fzrele"&gt;Other promised enhancements include overhauled graphics, better navigation via the games’ mini maps, and modern quality of life features like Achievements and Trophies on Xbox and PlayStation respectively. On Switch the game will feature motion-controlled aiming and touchscreen controls, and on PC the games will be compatible with Nvidia’s DLSS tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbNMMl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uk706HvkZlU?rel=0&amp;amp;start=2" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TM5JLe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition &lt;/em&gt;will officially launch digitally tomorrow, November 11th, for $59.99 (£54.99) and will be available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and newer Series X/S consoles, and PC via the Rockstar Games Launcher. A physical release is coming on December 7th, while iOS and Android versions are launching in the first half of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes hired a bunch of experts so she could ignore them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Qux9daylEIvyUmEu20DQYffEjQ=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119881/1235841861.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It seems like the doctors were just at Theranos for show&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uotItX"&gt;Here’s the thing about prostate-specific antigen: you do not expect to find it in blood test results for most women, because most women don’t have prostates. So when Theranos’ former lab director, Kingshuk Das, found that Theranos’ devices kept reporting that women had detectable PSA levels, he assumed that meant there was something wrong with the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQ1wh0"&gt;Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes had an “alternative explanation,” he said. It was that these women had a rare kind of breast cancer. That explanation “seemed implausible,” he testified today in US v. Elizabeth Holmes. Das was one of a parade of experts we’ve heard from in this trial, who it seems were hired primarily to be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLwQ9j"&gt;The central question of the trial, as framed by Holmes’ defense, was whether Holmes knew she was misleading people or whether she was simply a naif who somehow accidentally showed investors documents with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;Pfizer and Schering-Plough logos on them, despite being written by Theranos staff&lt;/a&gt;. The question of state of mind is crucial: did she have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;the intent to deceive&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6LCeO"&gt;By the time Das had been brought aboard as lab director, several other lab directors had become uncomfortable with Theranos and quit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22705156/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-aging-the-case-rosendorff"&gt;most notably Adam Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt;, who was a major source for John Carreyrou’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;2015 exposé about the company&lt;/a&gt; after being sidelined by Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59PQSe"&gt;In fact, testifying before Das this morning was Lynette Sawyer, a temporary co-lab director who never went to the physical lab and whose job seems to have been signing documents in Docusign. Her co-lab director, who was also a dermatologist for Holmes’ co-defendant Sunny Balwani, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/mynQhKwWy8Lmdmbz0X5G"&gt;had testified&lt;/a&gt; he didn’t know she was signing documents at the time. (Balwani is being tried separately.) Sawyer did not want to stay on after her six-month contract ended because she was “uncomfortable” with Thearnos’ lab procedures, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bO0nm0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both lab directors’ testimony suggested a clownshoes operation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8FAQU"&gt;During testimony this morning, Sawyer also told the court that she did not know what a Nanotainer was. (A Nanotainer was Theranos’ proprietary technology for storing fingerstick samples.) She also did not know that Theranos had modified third-party devices to run fingerstick samples. And Theranos apparently botched her paperwork; after she left, she had to send over a certificate necessary to show she could serve as a lab director, which Theranos would have to produce for an audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLCwYR"&gt;Both lab directors’ testimony suggested a clownshoes operation, but Sawyer didn’t have direct contact with Holmes. Das sure did, though. One strategy the defense has employed throughout the trial is to suggest that Holmes leaned heavily on Balwani, her co-defendant, and any possible fraud must have originated with him, not her. But Balwani left Theranos shortly after Das joined. He dealt only with Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O836ek"&gt;After Das joined the company, he received a stern letter from the lab’s regulator, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, saying the lab was deficient and enclosing a 121-page report on all the problems. Dealing with the lab’s deficiencies was “nearly the sole responsibility I had,” Das testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdiGm5"&gt;He reported to Holmes. He consulted with her frequently while trying to fix the lab. He even flew to Washington, DC with her to meet with CMS regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDCy6q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I found these instruments to be unsuitable for clinical use.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJY5q8"&gt;Throughout his testimony, Das painted a portrait of a woman who willfully refused to believe there was anything wrong with the Theranos devices themselves. Besides the weird thing about rare breast cancers, Holmes also didn’t agree with Das’ assessment that “these instruments were not performing from the very beginning.” Das came to this conclusion after extensively reviewing Edison data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwJiLl"&gt;But Holmes tried to blame quality-control problems, not the machines themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMIhkZ"&gt;To respond to CMS, Das voided years’ worth of patient results on the Theranos devices, sending results to patients and doctors that said the test result essentially wasn’t real. “I found these instruments to be unsuitable for clinical use,” he said. After going through a great deal of documentation from CMS about the various Edison failures — which underscored &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;earlier testimony from Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt; about Edison’s problems — the prosecution turned the witness over to the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4beS2d"&gt;Now, a great many people were hired to fix the Theranos lab conditions, Das testified when he was cross-examined. Those people were serious and diligent, and they worked hard, and he was the “quarterback,” in the terminology of Holmes’ lawyer Lance Wade, of that team. But if Holmes could not accept multiple lab directors telling her the Theranos machines didn’t work, I’m not sure it mattered how many experts were brought in to try to fix the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge orders Apple to allow external payment options for App Store by December 9th, denying stay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zfHbVkLMMQhHZhTITOgrGxiM88k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119772/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r9RfBg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers says Apple must comply with an order to let developers add links and buttons to external payment options, denying the company’s motion for a stay. “Apple’s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court’s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction,” her new order reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKykar"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers issued her order after a Tuesday hearing concerning the blockbuster antitrust lawsuit, which &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; publisher Epic Games filed in 2020 and which went to trial this year. During the hearing, Apple said it needed more time to rewrite its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering policies&lt;/a&gt; — rules that bar app developers from linking to payment methods besides the iOS App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trMA1x"&gt;“This will be the first time Apple has ever allowed live links in an app for digital content. It’s going to take months to figure out the engineering, economic, business, and other issues,” said Apple attorney Mark Perry. “It is exceedingly complicated. There have to be guardrails and guidelines to protect children, to protect developers, to protect consumers, to protect Apple. And they have to be written into guidelines that can be explained and enforced and applied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lwz4gq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kq9mBW"&gt;Apple has mostly praised the ruling in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; — where Judge Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;concluded that Apple hadn’t violated antitrust law&lt;/a&gt; by kicking &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off the App Store and said the company didn’t have to restate Epic’s developer account. But it appealed the section saying that Apple’s anti-steering policies hid relevant information from users and demanding that it remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztycTy"&gt;Perry noted that Apple already made one of the two required changes. In August, as part of a class action lawsuit settlement, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;removed a rule&lt;/a&gt; restricting how developers could contact users via email. But Apple has portrayed in-app links as a unique threat to user trust and safety, saying they could let developers scam users or send them to malicious sites. “We believe that these changes, if Apple is forced to implement them, will upset the platform. They will harm consumers. They will harm developers. That is a fact. It is going to happen,” said Perry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAZvlT"&gt;Epic framed Apple’s request as a delay tactic made without any real commitment to change. “Apple does nothing unless it is forced to do it,” said Epic attorney Gary Bornstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4onQB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You haven’t asked for additional time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIx9yQ"&gt;Judge Gonzalez Rogers was skeptical of Apple’s request particularly because it asked for an indefinite stay of the injunction despite saying Apple just wanted more time to evaluate risks. “You haven’t asked for additional time. You’ve asked for an injunction which would effectively take years,” she said. “You asked for an across-the-board stay which could take 3, 4, 5 years.” Perry responded that Apple wanted to delay the changes until the case was resolved — saying that it was confident “we’re going to win the appeal.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhANpj"&gt;That didn’t sway the judge: in her order Tuesday evening, she accused Apple of wanting “an open-ended stay with no requirement that it make any effort to comply,” and suggested that “Apple has provided no credible reason for the Court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,” with regards to the company’s argument that it would be harmed by adding external links to alternate payment systems within apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7KPck"&gt;Apple says it plans to appeal to the Ninth Circuit for a stay, since it didn’t get one from Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “Apple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved. We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,” writes an Apple spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMMHyJ"&gt;Pending a stay of some kind, the injunction is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;scheduled to take effect&lt;/a&gt; on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Instagram will delete ‘sensitive’ ad targeting groups linked to race, politics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fqvz8F_NH0xjs7s_tze6-Z9bxWo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70119634/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzMqma"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;Meta, the new name&lt;/a&gt; for the parent company that oversees Facebook and Instagram, suddenly wants to be less creepy. According to a post on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/removing-certain-ad-targeting-options-and-expanding-our-ad-controls"&gt;Meta for Business blog&lt;/a&gt;, the company is blocking advertisers from using detailed ad targeting options that show ads based on your engagement in “sensitive” areas including race or ethnicity, religious views, political beliefs, sexual orientation, health, and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3H7gP"&gt;“We’ve heard concerns from experts that targeting options like these could be used in ways that lead to negative experiences for people in underrepresented groups,” Graham Mudd, Meta’s vice president for marketing and ads writes in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6hlNe"&gt;Meta emphasizes that detailed targeting options aren’t actually based on your physical characteristics or personal choices. Rather, they’re what advertisers &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you might be interested in based on your activity. Even still, detailed targeting can be harmful. Predatory ads &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/9/21204425/targeted-ads-fertility-eating-disorder-coronavirus"&gt;can feel discriminatory, reinforce addictions, negatively influence behavior, and even cause mental distress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vyZJFS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Targeting options like these could be used in ways that lead to negative experiences”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V9V4Wg"&gt;Meta is planning on hitting the “delete” key on many of its “sensitive” detailed targeting options, but this comes after several instances in which Facebook had to remove controversial categories in the past. Previously, advertisers could target ads to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2017/9/15/16313916/facebook-restricts-targeting-fields-anti-semitism-ads"&gt;anti-Semitic categories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232547/facebook-pseudoscience-ad-targeting-coronavirus"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. It also let companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18273018/facebook-housing-ads-jobs-discrimination-settlement"&gt;target housing, job, and credit ads by “multicultural affinity”&lt;/a&gt; that could exclude certain races. And only after the Cambridge Analytica scandal did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17174854/facebook-shutting-down-partner-categories-ad-targeting-cambridge-analytica"&gt;Facebook stop allowing third-party data&lt;/a&gt; for targeting ads in 2018, cutting off companies that sold data like your purchasing history to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PUWfPo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This wasn’t an easy decision. Some of our advertising partners have expressed concerns about these targeting options going away because of their ability to help generate positive societal change. We know this change will negatively impact some businesses and organizations. (3/4) &lt;a href="https://t.co/RpQ6124CKQ"&gt;https://t.co/RpQ6124CKQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roy Austin, Jr. (@RAustin_Jr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RAustin_Jr/status/1458165826670956546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tlgVm"&gt;The reason for this recent change might have something to do with protecting mental health, but if we look at the bigger picture, Meta is likely preparing for the outcome of the EU’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/"&gt;efforts to form regulations that ban tracking-based advertising&lt;/a&gt;. Meta’s global advertising system can’t effectively filter out certain areas, so it will have to turn off detailed targeting groups across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jG9oO"&gt;In the third quarter of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277963/facebooks-quarterly-global-revenue-by-segment/"&gt;Facebook’s total advertising revenue amounted to $28.2 billion&lt;/a&gt;, which may explain why it was such a “difficult” decision to make, as noted in the post. The change will go into effect across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger on January 19th, 2022. However, this still won’t stop Meta from targeting you based on your age, gender, and location — it just might prevent you from getting targeted based on your online persona’s affinity for an oddly specific subgroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SZkLPQ"&gt;Netflix also shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onepiecenetflix/status/1458192931064455169"&gt;a note from &lt;em&gt;One Piece &lt;/em&gt;creator Eiichiro Oda&lt;/a&gt; about the development of the series, which &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/01/one-piece-live-action-series-based-on-manga-classic-ordered-netflix-tomorrow-studios-1202845657/"&gt;reportedly will have 10 episodes&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Oda doesn’t say much about what you can expect from the show, and as for when it might be released, he alludes vaguely that “it’ll take a bit more time to get this show done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="aMeTY2"&gt;Netflix has been investing heavily in live-action adaptations of popular animated shows. The company also announced Tuesday that it’s working on a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458011481576927235"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yu Yu Hakusho&lt;/em&gt; series for 2023&lt;/a&gt;. In August, the company revealed some of the cast for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621540/netflix-avatar-the-last-airbender-live-action-cast"&gt;forthcoming &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; (which we also recently learned &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/daniel-dae-kim-avatar-the-last-airbender-netflix-live-action-series-fire-lord-ozai-1234867510/"&gt;includes Daniel Dae Kim&lt;/a&gt;). And we’re only a few days from the November 19th premiere of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747655/netflix-cowboy-bebop-trailer-premier"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WV5rJ3"&gt;Public skin image datasets that are used to train algorithms to detect skin problems don’t include enough information about skin tone, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00252-1/fulltext"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt;. And within the datasets where skin tone information is available, only a very small number of images are of darker skin — so algorithms built using these datasets might not be as accurate for people who aren’t white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8pzQ7"&gt;The study, published today in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lancet Digital Health&lt;/em&gt;, examined 21 freely accessible datasets of images of skin conditions. Combined, they contained over 100,000 images. Just over 1,400 of those images had information attached about the ethnicity of the patient, and only 2,236 had information about skin color. This lack of data limits researchers’ ability to spot biases in algorithms trained on the images. And such algorithms could very well be biased: Of the images with skin tone information, only 11 were from patients with the darkest two categories on the Fitzpatrick scale, which classifies skin color. There were no images from patients with an African, Afro-Caribbean, or South Asian background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcHWcw"&gt;The conclusions are similar to those from a study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2784295"&gt;published in September&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22689562/dermatology-algorithm-transparency-google-skin-cancer"&gt;also found&lt;/a&gt; that most datasets used for training&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dermatology algorithms don’t have information about ethnicity or skin tone. That study examined the data behind 70 studies that developed or tested algorithms and found that only seven described the skin types in the images used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZtsGq"&gt;“What we see from the small number of papers that do report out skin tone distributions, is that those do show an underrepresentation of darker skin tones,” says Roxana Daneshjou, a clinical scholar in dermatology at Stanford University and author on the September paper. Her paper analyzed many of the same datasets as the new &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; research and came to similar conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGP9Dj"&gt;When images in a dataset are publicly available, researchers can go through and review what skin tones appear to be present. But that can be difficult, because photos may not exactly match what the skin tone looks like in real life. “The most ideal situation is that skin tone is noted at the time of the clinical visit,” Daneshjou says. Then, the image of that patient’s skin problem could be labeled before it goes into a database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJTXaU"&gt;Without labels on images, researchers can’t check algorithms to see if they’re built using datasets with enough examples of people with different skin types. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJ0cLr"&gt;It’s important to scrutinize these image sets because they’re often used to build algorithms that help doctors diagnose patients with skin conditions, some of which — like skin cancers — are more dangerous if they’re not caught early. If the algorithms have only been trained or tested on light skin, they won’t be as accurate for everyone else. “Research has shown that programs trained on images taken from people with lighter skin types only might not be as accurate for people with darker skin, and vice versa,” says David Wen, a co-author on the new paper and a researcher at the University of Oxford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkrADw"&gt;New images can always be added to public datasets, and researchers want to see more examples of conditions on darker skin. And improving the transparency and clarity of the datasets will help researchers track progress toward more diverse image sets that could lead to more equitable AI tools. “I would like to see more open data and more well-labeled data,” Daneshjou says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDSEsg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TAypCN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/"&gt;Apple has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s current CEO, Alex Gorsky, will join its board of directors. Gorsky’s move to Apple’s leadership team (he’ll &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/johnson-johnsons-2021-third-quarter-earnings-report-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;step down from his role at J&amp;amp;J in January&lt;/a&gt;) comes at a time when the company is focusing even more on health and how it can make data more accessible to users and their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5XdhP"&gt;In the press release announcing Gorsky’s role at Apple, Tim Cook calls him “a visionary in healthcare” who has a “passion for technology.” Apple hasn’t kept its ambitions in health a secret — the Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"&gt;largely seen as a fitness device&lt;/a&gt;, and its users can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/research-app/"&gt;contribute data to various studies&lt;/a&gt;. Recent updates to iOS and watchOS have brought new health features that make it easier to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22672388/health-app-apple-data-records-allscripts-cerner"&gt;share medical records with doctors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527707/apple-health-data-eldery-falls-walking-privacy"&gt;family members&lt;/a&gt;. With Gorsky on the board, Apple could tap him for new feature ideas (such as what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;new sensors it could add to the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;) or use his expertise to add more integrations with the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="V1LvOs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The unexpected health impacts of wearable tech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733073/smartwatch-wearable-health-impact-doctors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mAGIs8"&gt;Apple and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson have existing ties — the two companies are working together on &lt;a href="https://www.heartline.com/about"&gt;the Heartline study&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to see if the Apple Watch can help detect atrial fibrillation before symptoms become obvious or dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQcTuz"&gt;Apple’s health efforts haven’t been without controversy, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594178/apple-watch-data-research-heart-rate-reliability"&gt;Some medical researchers have said&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s lack of transparency into its algorithms to measure things like heart rate makes it difficult to use data from Apple Watches in research. There have also been reports from inside Apple that the health division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710901/apple-health-clinic-data-misleading-culture"&gt;uses potentially misleading data to make product decisions&lt;/a&gt;, and employees also raised concerns about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536623/apple-primary-care-project-data-watch-app"&gt;plans for a trial where it would act as a primary healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBdlcU"&gt;It’s possible that having someone with experience could help Apple navigate these potential hurdles and make the Apple Watch an even more powerful health tool (though Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551723/johnson-stop-selling-opioids-settlement-new-york-lawsuit"&gt;faced&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/"&gt;fair share of controversies&lt;/a&gt; since Gorsky &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/leadership/alex-gorsky"&gt;became CEO in 2012&lt;/a&gt;). It’s also possible that it’s more of a symbolic move to emphasize Apple’s focus on health — we’ll only be able to tell by seeing what Apple does with health in the future or if Grosky appears on stage at WWDC to talk about a collaboration between J&amp;amp;J and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
