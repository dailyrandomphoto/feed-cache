  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPads are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable — now outgoing — entry-level iPad from last year, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of sale happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s often what deal our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each iPads model that is currently available, some of which are also available &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished&lt;/a&gt;. You should also be aware that &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is currently running its back-to-school promotion&lt;/a&gt; until September 27th, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90. Either way, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out through Apple’s educational storefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, however, it’s now being replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;9th Gen model announced&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;Apple’s recent iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re in the market for the new model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;preorders are available now&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments slated for Friday, September 24th. As you might expect, there are no discounts currently available on the 2021 model, given the tablet has yet to hit store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;If you want to try getting the best possible price on last year’s model, though, know that the 32GB model initially retailed for $329 and the 128GB variant for $429. The new, 64GB model goes for the same price as last year’s 32GB variant ($329), while the 256GB configuration jumps to $479. The 2020 model has the same 10.2-inch display and features the older A12 Bionic processor, a front-facing Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the physical home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9iBwQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, the outgoing base model iPad is a bit hard to come by at many retailers. It is either out of stock or marked as discontinued at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-10-2-inch-wi-fi-only-8th-generation%2F-%2FA-81498539%3Fpreselect%3D80596591%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1751882593844829755#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594504-REG%2Fapple_myl92ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_32gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Apple only offers a refurbished one with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFW782LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-IPAD-WI-FI-128GB-Silver%3Ffnode%3Df7a6c58dde7329b21579b02c65a17e1f89102b3746bf56fb4fc1e60dbff56530c0f1da3d19e86a9a6f6e6858f96394b5d01117d34b59a73cdea074885f80ed0867aa9a4cdbdcf73ca96c7f42bd02edf1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage and Wi-Fi for $279&lt;/a&gt;, though the new ninth-generation model might be a more compelling proposition if you prefer the benefits of the faster A13 Bionic processor and 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. That said, we’ll keep an eye out for any sale opportunities before the 2020 iPads are completely gone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019 with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s “California Streaming” event. While the upcoming, revamped Mini looks promising with its larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and 5G option, it also starts at a higher price point of $599. The current iPad Mini has the A12 Bionic processor and normally runs $399 for 64GB of storage and $549 for 256GB. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model of the 2019 iPad Mini don’t always come around, though we have seen some recently. The 64GB, Wi-Fi-enabled iPad Mini is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available right now for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in space gray and gold. Amazon does not currently have any 64GB models in stock, but is offering the 256GB unit &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $449&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-256GB%2F211304805%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart offers all three colors of the expanded storage option for the same price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skoMEh"&gt;Just like the base iPad, the replacement model looks enticing — and if you’re interested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can preorder it now&lt;/a&gt; — though there will certainly be a bigger price delta with the increased starting price of the new iPad Mini and the fact that its predecessor is sure to continue receiving discounts. Also, as of right now, the 2021 model is not available at a discount, which is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in all of its vibrant colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F694429303&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is available for a $100 discount from the same retailers, with your choice of most colors marked down to $650 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The one outlier is the green model, which has a more modestly discounted price of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$720&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tNTIrn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple is releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 on September 20th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148110/2092?subId1=VergeiPadDeals080321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; — though you may have to pick it up at a brick-and-mortar location near you. The 256GB model is available for $769 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553812-REG%2Fapple_mxdc2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $800 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,150, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you prefer Wi-Fi only, the 128GB model is discounted to $849 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553840-REG%2Fapple_my2h2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB model is $929 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,150 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,350&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-generation model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F354993710" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $50 off, bringing the price down to $749.

    <title>OpenSea product chief accused of flipping NFTs using insider information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L_jDqShS5M2fR0Azh8_L1ppIUWE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863372/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WphlKb"&gt;OpenSea, the biggest NFT trading marketplace, &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt; that one of its employees used internal information to buy NFTs that were about to be featured on its homepage — and likely spike in value. Accusations were made against OpenSea’s head of product, Nate Chastain, last night after a community member publicized suspicious transactions from his wallet. “Yesterday we learned that one of our employees purchased items that they knew were set to display on our front page before they appeared there publicly,” the announcement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1438122446847201283?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; by OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer read. “​​This is incredibly disappointing.” The site explicitly &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/tos"&gt;prohibits&lt;/a&gt; “deceptive or manipulative trading activities” in its Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOpS0E"&gt;The statement was prompted by a community-led investigation of Chastain’s trades. On Twitter yesterday, a user named ZuwuTV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921263394115584"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a thread claiming Chastain operated “secret wallets” that purchased the site’s front page NFTs before they were “featured,” later selling them for a profit once the price increased due to their exposure. In the thread, ZuwuTV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921701589921801?s=20"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a September 14th transaction where Chastain allegedly sent 5 Ethereum (around $17,000 USD) from his known wallet to an anonymous wallet that then sent the money to a third account. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RiceFarmerNFT/status/1437956088998072325?s=20"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; user, ricefarmer.eth, the account purchased four NFTs by artist Dailydust, one titled “Spectrum Of A Ramenfication Theory,” which OpenSea directly featured soon afterward. The account is then alleged to have “flipped” the NFTs for a profit of roughly 2 Ethereum and funneled the money back to Chastain’s original wallet. OpenSea has not confirmed which NFTs were traded on using internal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mQrwBX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because there’s a blockchain … at least we know a hell of a lot more and can talk about it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLMYqw"&gt;As the NFT community picked up on ZuwuTV’s investigation last night, he posted more transactions suggesting that the front running behavior could have begun as early as last month. Using tools such as Wayback Machine and Twitter’s advanced search function, ZuwuTV and other users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437932608067866629?s=20"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that Chastain likely purchased would-be-featured NFTs before or immediately after the OpenSea website updated. Like other NFT platforms such as Nifty Gateway, OpenSea’s front page is curated by hand rather than algorithmically determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVWjId"&gt;Because the Ethereum blockchain is transparent, meaning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;all transactions are permanently recorded on a public ledger&lt;/a&gt;, users were able to follow the money trail leading back to Chastain’s publicly known account. Every transaction is timestamped, and the NFT or Ethereum traded is known. This transparency has historically allowed users to protect the community by uncovering elaborate scams, such as when “cybersleuth” Fedor Linnik discovered that the team behind a million-dollar “female-led” project was &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/fame-lady-squad-nft-women-men-scandal-scam"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; Russian men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmSQkP"&gt;In a late-night Twitter Spaces titled “Investigating allegations” (with the monocle face emoji at the end), over 1,700 NFT collectors and traders joined to discuss the situation. Many celebrated the capabilities of the blockchain, arguing that the technology enabled a thorough investigation despite the unsettling findings. “Because there’s a blockchain … at least we know a hell of a lot more and can talk about it,” fungiblΞs, an NFT trader, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpbIQV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s nice words from OpenSea, but we have heard those words before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICOZnU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lurklovesyou"&gt;LURKLOVESYOU&lt;/a&gt;, one of OpenSea’s featured artists, whose work was allegedly flipped by Chastain, said he wasn’t paid or knowingly involved in the trading. He also surmised that he had been selected mainly because he had helped OpenSea with an art show but never got a heads-up from the site. “From an artist’s point of view, I’m just a guy who’s doing artwork and enjoying the NFT space and community. This has kind of shaken me a little bit,” he said during the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26j9Xv"&gt;In the wake of the investigation, OpenSea has implemented new policies regarding team members. They “may not buy or sell from collections or creators while we are featuring or promoting them” and are “prohibited from using confidential information to purchase or sell any NFTs, whether available on the OpenSea platform or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1NMS7"&gt;Chastain did not respond to a request for comment. As of writing, Chastain has yet to make a public statement, and OpenSea has not directly named him as the employee involved. Yet, despite the concerns the allegations raise — trusting OpenSea’s centralized curation practices, the merits of Securities and Exchange Commission regulation versus community-led regulation, and insider trading in general — many NFT community members remain optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pv3RML"&gt;“It’s nice words from OpenSea, but we have heard those words before. If they follow through, this could turn into a good thing,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFTherder"&gt;OK Hotshot&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of ZuwuTV who also does blockchain analysis, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhhAFA"&gt;“We just invented anti-insider trading by putting this on blast. If this were a humongous trading firm, they would have done so much to bury the story,” &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/yuppieventures"&gt;yuppie.eth&lt;/a&gt;, a community member and co-host of the Spaces, added last night. “We’re working for the best interests of the customers of OpenSea right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to wipe your iPhone before selling it or trading it in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRZDDxjgCrH3NcjNp8c-HipaLj0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863370/jbareham_171031_2099_A_0227.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVRqDL"&gt;Whether you’re trading in your old iPhone for a discount on a new one, selling it, giving it away, or recycling it, you’re going to want to erase all of your data first. Not only do you want to keep personal information from falling into the wrong hands, but let’s face it: nobody’s going to want a phone with your old selfies on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTTd2a"&gt;After you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671906/iphone-date-transfer-ios-icloud-upgrade"&gt;transferred all of your data to a new phone&lt;/a&gt; (or, if you’re not getting a new phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22673693/iphone-apple-backup-ios-icloud"&gt;backed your data up&lt;/a&gt;), here’s how to wipe your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KJzHI1"&gt;Get rid of a few identifiable features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uUBuwb"&gt;Disable “Find My iPhone” by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Find My” &amp;gt; “Find My Phone” and toggling “Find My Phone” and “Find My Network” to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQ6OXX"&gt;Unpair any devices from your phone, including your Apple Watch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMREGp"&gt;Toggle iMessages off (just in case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g1y20x"&gt;Sign out of your Apple ID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t9tT4x"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “Sign Out” (at the bottom of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LaxEWl"&gt;Enter your Apple ID password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xmVLyK"&gt;You’ll be asked if you want to keep a copy of your data on this iPhone. Assuming you’ve backed everything up and are about to wipe your phone, you don’t need to toggle anything on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZdkhV"&gt;Tap on “Sign Out” in the upper-right corner and then again on the “Are you sure?” pop-up window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1ucZCq"&gt;Get ready to erase it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHqjWX"&gt;Remove the SIM card from the phone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72iH92"&gt;Go into “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone” and select “Erase All Content and Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piUZnlaqfVeSDb64HBCoO6H3iqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838056/IMG_C0157C8B9455_1.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>Why your Nintendo Switch might seem borked after the Bluetooth update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD0cNGqEGu55bCn3-QZItmOVXk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863358/jbareham_1492_170228_0126.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XKHYgm"&gt;Did the Nintendo Switch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;surprise Bluetooth audio update yesterday&lt;/a&gt; make your handheld worse instead of better? That’s what happened to me: instead of inviting me to the magical world of wireless audio, it repeatedly failed to detect my headsets and connect to them reliably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aldVPo"&gt;Worse, it suddenly took more than 30 seconds to wake my Switch from sleep! That’s a huge pain in the ass, considering one of the Switch’s single greatest strengths is how you can instantly jump back into a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngFZAj"&gt;But after a whole bunch of testing, I think I know what’s going on — and if you’re seeing the same thing, a full Switch shutdown seems to offer a partial fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGyTy9"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; that simple, though, so read on for the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVwuoX"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Bluetooth pairing problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bsa1Fn"&gt;To pair a Bluetooth headset, you’re supposed to go to &lt;strong&gt;System Settings&lt;/strong&gt;, scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Bluetooth Audio&lt;/strong&gt;, set your Bluetooth device to pairing mode, tap &lt;strong&gt;Pair Device &lt;/strong&gt;on your Switch, then select your device once it appears on the Switch’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHKoZR"&gt;If it pairs, you’re set! If it fails because your device wasn’t ready to pair, you &lt;em&gt;might &lt;/em&gt;still be okay. Simply put it in pairing mode again, and tap the &lt;strong&gt;Search Again&lt;/strong&gt; button on your Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mrphq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two problems: ghost pairing and wake delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5NaXwO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #1. &lt;/strong&gt;But if it fails to pair &lt;em&gt;properly — &lt;/em&gt;if your Switch &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; it paired, if your headset is blinking like it’s paired, but isn’t routing audio and isn’t showing up on your Switch screen as a paired headset — you might be in for a world of hurt. The Switch’s process does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fail gracefully, and you may run into all kinds of error messages afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKwAOu"&gt;After that point, my Switch sometimes won’t even bother to keep scanning for Bluetooth devices. It’ll pop up an “Unable to find Bluetooth audio devices” message the moment I hit the scan button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ij7AIm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #2. &lt;/strong&gt;And if you’ve run into a ghost pairing issue, you might experience a problem with the Switch waking from sleep as well — because it appears the Switch tries to fire up Bluetooth audio &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it wakes the screen and controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1vFj4"&gt;Here’s what the Nintendo Switch looks like with no Bluetooth audio devices paired or remembered whatsoever. It wakes pretty quickly, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WAO6BR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s how quickly a Nintendo Switch is supposed to wake. No headset. &lt;a href="https://t.co/zrpoMTT6Cd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zrpoMTT6Cd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1438206760188219392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4lK7h"&gt;But once I pair a headset to the Switch, it’s no longer instant: the screen takes a little longer to light up, and it doesn’t immediately recognize my button presses that let me unlock the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rutayd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s with a paired headset. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Gdqd7UBbIW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Gdqd7UBbIW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1438207007790551042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwZy7E"&gt;Now, here’s what it’s like when the Switch fails to pair properly with a waiting headset: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A1DTJQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, uh, not only does my Nintendo Switch not get along with Bluetooth headphones as of the new update… it now takes a MINIMUM of 10 seconds to wake from sleep. &lt;a href="https://t.co/13dUvv41ga"&gt;pic.twitter.com/13dUvv41ga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1437965735389585409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F05NSU"&gt;(Why yes, my eyes &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; look scary when they’re bugging out, thanks for noticing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MYikpz"&gt;How to partially fix Nintendo Switch Bluetooth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iHsGUQ"&gt;You need to fully shut down the Switch, and I mean fully shut it down. I restarted it loads of times, and it didn’t seem to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="sMMaDf"&gt;Tap the power button and wait however long it takes for your screen to turn on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IZiPPH"&gt;Unpair and forget any Bluetooth devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UbEGfW"&gt;Hold down the power button for four seconds until you see &lt;strong&gt;Power Options&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NmZoQs"&gt;Tap &lt;strong&gt;Power Options &lt;/strong&gt;then hit &lt;strong&gt;Turn Off&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6I7uEX"&gt;Wait a beat, then power on your Switch again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qlaucw"&gt;Sometimes, simply shutting off my Switch was enough to fix my ghost pairing issue (where I saw a 10–30-second delay when waking the system) and let me start pairing Bluetooth headsets again. I was able to get my Wyze Buds Pro to pair on the very first try, a headset that repeatedly failed to connect at all last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbV4Tn"&gt;But other times, it still wouldn’t do an initial pair — and as soon as I saw that “Unable to find Bluetooth audio devices” message, my Switch would take ages to wake from sleep once again. Your mileage may vary: in case it matters, I’m using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802539/nintendo-switch-v2-new-updated-battery-console-how-to-buy"&gt;the v2 of the original Switch, the one that added more battery life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y7mhyU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some Bluetooth devices may simply not work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0kH788"&gt;And if you’re trying to restore the full wake-up speed the Switch is normally known for, you’ll also need to unpair and forget any Bluetooth devices &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you do the full shutdown. When I simply unpaired a Bluetooth headset but left it in the Bluetooth menu, I still saw the small delay. Same thing if I shut down first then unpaired and forgot the headset second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Afwo8E"&gt;My guess is the Switch leaves its Bluetooth audio feature turned on whenever it thinks you’re going to use it, but you can force it off by removing those devices and initiating a full shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgpQC2"&gt;We’ve asked Nintendo whether these are known issues and whether we can expect fixes in a future firmware update. We’ll let you know what we hear. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s tvOS 15 update arrives September 20th sans SharePlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wivW8lRbosMS8MKNLw1kM7BTwOg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863338/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2DXjp"&gt;The refreshed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; hit shelves in April, but the anticipated tvOS 15 update that introduces exciting updates to the Apple TV experience was previously only available in beta. That will change next week: Apple has confirmed tvOS 15 will become widely available to everyone on September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkRNFp"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the tvOS 15 update will go live the same day as its other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;operating system updates&lt;/a&gt;, which include iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The tvOS 15 update brings a number of new features to the Apple TV experience. SharePlay is arguably the most exciting addition to the experience and will allow FaceTime users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;stream titles together&lt;/a&gt; in sync across their Apple devices, including on Apple TV. However, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;confirmed in August&lt;/a&gt; that the feature would be delayed on iOS 15 and tvOS 15 initially and would arrive in a later update, so that feature’s currently still on ice — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xszn4z"&gt;tvOS will also add two new discovery features to its Apple TV app: For All of You and Shared with You. For All of You will appear as a new row in the Apple TV app and will suggest titles for an entire household to stream together. Shared with You, meanwhile, will show movies and series that have been shared from Messages in their own row within the Apple TV app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rMl7tB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New discovery features and eventual support for SharePlay will arrive with tvOS 15&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1FPUPb"&gt;Plus, tvOS is also getting a handful of less flashy but nonetheless functionally exciting updates. Beginning with tvOS 15, Apple TV users will see an on-screen prompt to connect their AirPods for easy silent streaming, and the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max will also get support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt; when connected to the Apple TV for a theater-like experience. The update will also introduce HomePod Mini pairing as well as a HomeKit update that will allow Apple TV users to see multiple home camera feeds at once. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether any of these other expected features would be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXl0z9"&gt;tvOS 15 will be supported on the Apple TV HD, Apple TV 4K (2017), and the latest Apple TV 4K (2021). Look for the software update in the settings menu on your Apple TV device beginning next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIM swapper charged in cryptocurrency theft scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7uN_TSaE_Eh89c6857-srawK-8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863241/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g7zKb"&gt;A University of California San Diego student named Richard Yuan Li was indicted on August 26th for a SIM swapping scheme that involved stealing phone numbers and accounts and extorting at least 40 people for cryptocurrency and other payments, according to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/california-resident-charged-superseding-indictment-role-sim-swap-scam-targeting-least"&gt;a new release the US Department of Justice shared on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KReoIc"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/press-release/file/1432286/download"&gt;the indictment (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, Li convinced Apple customer service in 2018 to send him a replacement iPhone 8 for one he claimed was lost in the mail. Li and others then convinced carriers to port victims’ phone numbers to the iPhone 8 to take control of their accounts — and in some cases, drained their crypto wallets directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Bu3dS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A phone number could give you access to many different accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkyUy2"&gt;“Li and his co-conspirators contacted victims and demanded that they pay ransoms in order to avoid further harm, including additional account compromises, the loss of additional cryptocurrency, and the release of victims’ confidentiality information the conspirators obtained,” the DOJ writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHJqFP"&gt;If Li is convicted for all counts, including wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and “conspiracy to engage in interstate communication with intent to extort and to commit computer fraud and abuse,” he could serve 20 years in prison and pay a fine up to $250,000, among other possible charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYxEMd"&gt;SIM swapping is the practice of stealing someone’s identity by assuming their phone number. Typically, numbers from unsuspecting victims are ported over to burner phones — often by asking carriers to do it — and then scammers use those phones to impersonate the victim and seize control of their online accounts. Li’s case is an unfortunate reminder of how common SIM swapping is. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;it even happened to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIbOJU"&gt;Phone numbers being the key ingredient for identity theft has a lot to do with the common way two-factor authentication is set up. By default, many online services offer two-factor authentication but use a mobile phone as the second method for identifying someone. With stolen phone numbers, that can just as easily become a foothold to taking over someone’s account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP3dqaskJRC84C50bnOQSSkyrOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525171/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;are launching officially on September 20th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but you can test them in the public beta right now if you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs. Here, we walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for the iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;As expected, Apple announced the release date at its September event, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;it also showed off the new iPhone 13, iPad Mini with USB-C charging, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain some bugs. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdqQYd6S1VclYKqBImQmlJQ5trA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643660/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. For example, FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhlCIp"&gt;SharePlay, which will allow people to enjoy streaming entertainment together at the same time, was one of iOS 15’s most anticipated features, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple recently decided that it won’t arrive&lt;/a&gt; in the final version of iOS 15 launching on September 20th. Instead, it’ll arrive later in fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RjIx6e"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the home screen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Tern GSD S10 LX electric cargo bike review: no more excuses</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A powerful, impressive cargo bike in its own right, but it’s really all about the accessories &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L8CQmD"&gt;For certain parents, especially those in the US, the decision whether to take the kids to school on a bike or in a car often hinges on the weather. Sunshine and blue skies make it an easy choice to take the bike. But when the clouds roll in and there’s a hint of rain in the air, the idea of arriving with two soggy kids on the rear rack often steers some parents reluctantly toward the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flpkO2"&gt;Bad weather is just an excuse, really. People in other, more bike-friendly countries will ride in all seasons. Are they made of heartier stuff than us car-coddled Americans? Yes, but maybe we don’t actually need ice in our veins to ride through blizzards and hurricanes. Maybe we just need better accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cG7lOt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Taiwanese bike company’s GSD is already one of the best cargo bikes on the market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UtmxiA"&gt;Thankfully, Tern has a solution to help make these decisions a lot easier. The Taiwanese bike company’s GSD is already one of the best cargo bikes on the market. But with the addition of the Storm Shield, which provides an impressive layer of protection for passengers on the rear rack, you may be tempted to ride right into the eye of the storm, come hell or high water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4tfF8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10754781"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnHA6Y"&gt;Let’s start with the bike itself. Tern first introduced the GSD in 2017, and since then it’s released several updated models. I tested the top-line model, the GSD S10 LX with the Bosch Cargo Line motor. Tern loaned me its Storm Shield, Storm Box, and Clubhouse accessories as well. Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="X8bsLu"&gt;Motor: Bosch Cargo Line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m5FUDD"&gt;Top speed: 20mph (32km/h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f7mWtY"&gt;Range: 32-65 miles with single-battery configuration &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CDuV07"&gt;Battery: 500Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H6juO4"&gt;Weight: 71.7lbs (32.5kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L8PADh"&gt;Brakes: Magura MT5 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK21OB"&gt;Drive: Chain driven Shimano 10-speed geared hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w6Sh0L"&gt;Tires: 20 inches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NAjEC5"&gt;Extras: SunTour suspension front fork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V5otdl"&gt;Price: $5,499&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GSD’s price may turn some people away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PDJcLiVzp3Z22FB58xXUQF43uM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541916/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not the most powerful e-bike, but the GSD makes up for it with its ability to haul lots of stuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxuSb3"&gt;Looking at this bike, you may be left scratching your head at the design. The GSD doesn’t look like a traditional bike, with its small wheels and angular step-through frame. The back half of the bike frame is a mess of intersecting triangles and trapezoids. But looks are deceiving. The wheelbase is only slightly longer than most single-occupancy bikes, which matters a lot for storage and transportation, whether rolled onto a train or mounted to the back of your car. It’s also narrower than front-bucket designs from European companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21269590/carqon-cargo-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;Urban Arrow and Carqon&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to maneuver more easily through tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1RplA"&gt;Much like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274747/tern-hsd-p9-ebike-review-electric-cargo-bike-price-specs"&gt;smaller-but-no-less-capable sibling, the HSD&lt;/a&gt;, the Tern GSD is a workhorse e-bike with a bevy of made-to-impress components that help make biking feel seamless. It’s a mid-tail cargo bike, meaning it’s big enough to fit two kids on the rear rack while also being compatible with a hitch bike rack. It has a longer wheelbase than most traditional bikes, but is still considered shorter than a longtail cargo bike. The Tern GSD can carry up to 440 pounds including the bike, rider, cargo, and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuGkJB"&gt;The GSD is easy to store thanks to Tern’s commitment to bringing some element of its folding bike technology to most models in its e-bike lineup. The GSD’s handlebars can fold down, and the entire bike can be stored vertically thanks to the bumpers on the rear rack. That said, it’s still a cargo bike, so you’ll need to take into account the size of the bike and its storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4tcWfp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the things I admire in Tern’s lineup is the flexibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5ALuU"&gt;One of the things I admire in Tern’s lineup is the flexibility. The low-step frame combined with the handlebars and seat post that can be raised and lowered without any tools, as well as a custom SunTour front suspension fork, help make this a bike that can easily be passed around among family members or friends. Riders of all shapes and sizes will feel at ease on the GSD. I’m six-foot-one, and while I usually appreciate a larger sized bike frame, the GSD’s one-size-fits-all frame did not put me off in the slightest. The riding style is more upright than your typical racing or road bike, which can take some getting used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7vsE6"&gt;The GSD is a Class 1 electric bike in the US, meaning it’s pedal-assist with no throttle and a top speed of 20mph. There were times when I missed the twist throttle, especially when getting started from a standstill on a steep incline with a kid and extra cargo on the rear rack. The Shimano 10-speed gearing system certainly helps. But I also understand why some manufacturers avoid the throttle — and honestly believe that throttles will eventually run into regulatory issues in the future — so I try not to begrudge any bike for its exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GetDU"&gt;The Cargo Line motor is one of Bosch’s most powerful systems, designed specifically for e-bikes that carry lots of weight. It’s also a step up from the Bosch Performance line motors in the earlier models. The S10 LX comes with either a 500Wh or a 1,000Wh system with a motor that provides 85 Newton-meters of torque and up to 400 percent pedal assistance in its highest setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b7ZA3dTb5uEhjGwdx5lsL3e3UWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541910/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, I realize the Storm Shield is installed backward. So what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="al8OrN"&gt;Performance-wise, I wasn’t that impressed with the 500Wh battery pack, and if I had the money, I would definitely invest in the second battery. While Tern claims the GSD has a range of 32-62 miles (52-105km), I found myself needing to recharge the battery after as little as 20 miles of riding in the highest assist level on mostly flat surfaces with a few steep hills mixed in. The motor lacked some of the torque that you would find in a smaller, more nimble e-bike. And while the top speed is listed as 20mph, I was only able to hit that while going downhill. With a low center of gravity, the stability was great and it handled well as I biked through my suburban small town.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcX6I7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GSD stands for “get stuff done”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A8Taxo"&gt;GSD stands for “get stuff done”; that’s exactly what I did while I had it: took the kids to school, went grocery shopping, used it for all the little, ticky-tacky errands for which I might normally have used the car. All told, during a month of testing, I probably put 150-200 miles on it. I’m not trying to sound like a broken record, but e-bikes are car replacements, full stop. They get a lot of shit from the cycling community because they take a lot of the effort out of cycling, but that’s exactly the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atGTSu"&gt;The Tern GSD exemplifies their potential. If you live in the US, you’ve been conditioned into believing you need a car for daily life. And you probably do, because your community has been built to exclude most other forms of transportation in the interest of making driving as frictionless as possible. E-bikes, especially cargo ones like the GSD, can help smash through that conditioning and invite you to live in a cleaner, healthier, more sustainable world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bt25DOizidS8T8D6ognqswjwZWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541908/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This all-weather bike makes biking year-round more pleasurable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XcjzAl"&gt;Let’s get down off the soapbox and talk about accessories, because that’s what really turned me on to the GSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1XQ0L"&gt;In addition to loaning me the GSD, Tern also provided a bevy of cool add-ons, including two 52-liter panniers and three other accessories called the Clubhouse, Storm Box, and Storm Shield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNJ0Ur"&gt;The Clubhouse is essentially a seat pad with a backrest for the rack and rail that surrounds the whole thing to prevent passengers from falling off. The Storm Box provides a waterproof covering for their legs, while the Storm Shield is a waterproof nylon canopy that fits over the rack, with side panels that roll up or down depending on the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol8tSH"&gt;Altogether, Tern calls it the Clubhouse Fort, and my kids definitely treated it like their own private funhouse. Every morning, they couldn’t wait to hop on board for the 3.5-mile ride to their school. At the end of my testing period, I found all manner of gummy snacks and Goldfish crackers at the bottom of the Storm Box. I didn’t mind it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tk3dQF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be sure, it’s not cheap to outfit your bike with all these accessories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RW1IlE"&gt;To be sure, it’s not cheap to outfit your bike with all these accessories. The panniers ($250 for two), Clubhouse ($240), Storm Box ($220), and Storm Shield ($220) are all pretty expensive, especially in aggregate. And when added to the price tag for the GSD — $5,499 for single battery configuration, $6,299 for the dual-battery — you’re looking at an overall price tag of over $7,000, which is just stunning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8JbS6"&gt;Pricier than your average 10-speed, sure, but think about it in comparison to the costs of car ownership. For vehicles driven 15,000 miles a year, average car ownership costs were $9,561 a year, or $797 a month, in 2020, according to AAA. That figure includes depreciation, loan interest, fuel, insurance, maintenance and fees. In other words, the highest-spec Tern cargo bike, complete with all the fixin’s, is the equivalent of about nine months of car ownership in the US. Not a bad tradeoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvCXOs"&gt;Sure, I wish Tern were a bit cheaper — and you can certainly find cargo bikes with a similar array of accessories for less money — but I also know that the company puts a lot of effort into building some of the best e-bikes on the market today. They’re versatile, reliable, and powerful. But they also can help liberate you from the constraints of car ownership. To me, that’s worth the price alone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUFXBjqnWjabkSZro3YqcNX8z84=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862804/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13, featuring a very similar design to the iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JI022T"&gt;Apple had a lot of new features to announce with its iPhone 13 lineup this week. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; have better battery life, faster A15 Bionic processors, smaller display notches, upgraded cameras, and, when it comes to the Pro models, high refresh rate 120Hz ProMotion displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwsNDn"&gt;It’s a nice collection of updates, but take a step back and the range starts to look an awful lot like an iterative update over last year’s iPhone 12. They have an almost identical look to the squared-off design introduced with last year’s models, and Apple was careful to not directly compare the performance of its new A15 Bionic chip to last year’s A14 Bionic, only to its competitors. There’s also no major new initiative like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that Apple kicked off last year, and on the bottom of the phones you’ll see the same old Lightning port rather than USB-C. It all feels very familiar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lcv5Zw"&gt;So it’s no wonder that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTechChap/status/1437847213594587136"&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbhyudayaMohan/status/1437843526323040261"&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1437837861454106626"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; immediately responded to the phones’ announcement by referring to them as the “iPhone 12S,” aka a minor update to last year’s iPhone 12. That’s how Apple used to name its phones. There’d be a major update one year, usually with a big design change, followed up with a more minor revision that changed some internal components and features but kept the overall look and feel the same. The iPhone 3GS, 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS all used this approach. So what changed?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 5S 1024" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SL25tWylCs3ChepHV76_qzTKiCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13062703/IMG_3022-1024.1419979922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Michael Shane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 5S, which added a fingerprint sensor to Apple’s smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GGPTl4"&gt;Apple started to move away from this formula with 2016’s iPhone 7. Not only did the iPhone 7 break the cycle by using a very similar design to the previous year’s 6S instead of a new look (aside, of course, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12823596/apple-iphone-7-no-headphone-jack-lightning-earbuds"&gt;infamous missing headphone jack&lt;/a&gt;), but it was never followed by an S-model of its own. Instead, the next year Apple jumped straight to the iPhone 8, a minor revision that absolutely deserved to be called the 7S, and which ended up being completely overshadowed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;that year’s iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSCKp"&gt;Ever since 2018’s iPhone XS, it seems like Apple has abandoned the S-suffix entirely. Every year gets a new number, regardless of whether it offers a major overhaul like the iPhone 12 or a more minor update like the iPhone 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNdWnB"&gt;Of course, Apple’s closest competitor in the US, Samsung, has been using this approach for years. Every subsequent Galaxy S device has had a bigger number than its predecessor, and nobody wants to be the company with the lower-numbered phone than its rival. In fact, if Apple &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;released an iPhone 7S in 2017 it would have competed against Samsung’s Galaxy S8. No wonder Apple jumped straight to 8 and skipped the iPhone 9 entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqP5Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s wild in retrospect that Apple willingly advertised its “off” years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WKhPf"&gt;In retrospect it seems absolutely wild that Apple was willing to proudly broadcast that it was having an off year. Unless you were the kind of smartphone user that wanted to have the most up-to-date iPhone year after year, that S-suffix was a helpful indication that a new model only contained minor changes. “Don’t worry about upgrading this year, folks,” was the implicit message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXO6qh"&gt;But the reality was that smartphone technology was advancing so quickly at the time that even a “minor” upgrade could still contain massive new features. The iPhone 3GS was the first iPhone that could officially record video in addition to taking photos, the iPhone 4S introduced Apple’s Siri voice assistant to the world, and the 5S was the first iPhone with biometric security (a fingerprint sensor). These are all major additions that we now take for granted on modern Apple devices, and they arrived with the relatively muted fanfare of an S-branded iPhone. The S-branded iPhones also offered big camera improvements over the years: the 4S was the first with an 8-megapixel camera, the 5S added slow-motion video, and the 6S increased the rear camera’s resolution to 12 megapixels. Every year, Apple gave its customers a pretty good reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iphone 6s" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08MMY8EtNQN_-E4JW2hG6tBI1xU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4084770/iphone-6s-clean-2-15__1_.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S, the first iPhone with a 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="irYQi1"&gt;The smartphone market is now a very different place. Smartphones have matured, and even midrange models offer basically everything most people actually need a phone to do. Every year we’re told about the latest phones’ performance upgrades and edge-case camera improvements, but it’s nothing that’s going to completely change your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uvi33"&gt;Consumers have noticed. Far from upgrading to the latest iPhone every year, as of 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/smartphone-users-are-waiting-longer-before-upgrading-heres-why.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; that US customers were waiting an average of over two years to upgrade their phones, while in the UK people were waiting almost 28 months. At the time, these figures were all trending upward, and it seems safe to assume that they’ve grown even longer in the two years since. It was also around this time that iPhone sales &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940562/apple-q4-2019-earnings-iphone-sales-record-revenue-slow-services-income-mac-ipad-tim-cook"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18053782/apple-earnings-q4-2018-stop-ipad-iphone-mac-unit-sales-disclosure"&gt;Apple stopped reporting on iPhone sales numbers&lt;/a&gt;, opting instead to bundle their numbers in with other device categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vil21C"&gt;Instead of focusing on big upgrades, Apple seems to be prioritizing a bigger lineup with devices to appeal to different tastes and price points. As recently as 2017, the company was selling just two flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The following year it released three (the 8, 8 Plus, and X), and last year it switched to four with the iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max. With so many form factors to keep updated, it’s not surprising that big overhauls have become less common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nhsk6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People upgrade much less frequently than they once did&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYiaF"&gt;Unless you really want the latest and greatest technology, there really isn’t much of a reason to upgrade every year, and that’s a good thing! It’s much more affordable for those people who opt to buy their phones outright, and it’s worlds better for the environment. Apple may now be using more recycled materials in its devices, but manufacturing them and shipping them in the first place still uses resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBFxeT"&gt;In this context, it isn’t surprising that Apple has changed with the times. For starters, it’s making more of an effort to make money outside of hardware, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;increasingly broad array of subscription services&lt;/a&gt; covering everything from music and video streaming, to gaming and home fitness. If it can’t make money from selling you a new iPhone every year, it’ll sure as hell try to make money from you streaming the latest season of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hty5L5"&gt;That doesn’t mean that Apple has given up on the idea of selling you a new phone every year. Far from it. If branding this year’s phones as the iPhone 13 tells us anything, it’s that Apple is more keen than ever to convince its customers to upgrade, by branding this year’s phones as an all-new range as opposed to a more modest update to the iPhone 12. The slowing progress of smartphone technology means that Apple can’t afford to rest on its laurels with an S-branded device. Everything needs to be brand-new and as exciting as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYnqtS"&gt;So yes, this year’s iPhones could, and arguably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been branded as the iPhone 12S. But the smartphone industry has changed, and Apple has changed with it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeOAFFIkXYozdeIB8E_xA9aqhlg=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/joy_con_01.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model boasts a vibrant, 7-inch display and slate of minor upgrades.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $314&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to upgrade, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $322&lt;/a&gt; and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $344&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store, where you can often find refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $260, in addition to most color configurations of the Switch Lite for $170.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The forthcoming Nintendo Switch OLED model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578368/nintendo-switch-oled-preorder-time-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;opened for preorders on July 15th&lt;/a&gt;, with the initial preorder stock selling out within minutes. The higher-end Switch model — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially goes on sale on October 8th&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxXvjE"&gt;Although preorders for both models have come and gone since initially opening, as of the time of this writing, both configurations of the Nintendo Switch OLED are unavailable for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mGEroE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, though, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; also have the Switch Pro controller for $59, knocking $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlFlVd"&gt;Right now, Eneba offers a discounted &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year, individual membership for around $21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
