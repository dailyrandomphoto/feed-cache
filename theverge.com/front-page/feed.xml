    <title>A chatbot could help prevent eating disorders, new study finds</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyJ0cG"&gt;A chatbot may help reduce the likelihood a person develops an eating disorder, according to a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.23662"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. For women at a high risk for an eating disorder, going through a dialogue with a bot developed by researchers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reduced concern over body weight and shape — a factor that contributes to their risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3fS5D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25461783/"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; showed that digital prevention programs are more effective when they’re guided by a human moderator, says study author Ellen Fitzsimmons-Craft, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. But it’s hard to get funding in the United States for programs that prevent mental health conditions. The team thought a chatbot could be a cheaper, more scaleable version of such a program that offers “some aspects of moderation in an automated format,” Fitzsimmons-Craft says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntMF1u"&gt;The team developed a chatbot-version of the StudentBodies eating disorder prevention program, which is usually delivered through a website and includes informational content, exercises, and journal prompts. Participants could use the chatbot through texts or through Facebook Messenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD43V6"&gt;The study recruited female participants through online ads, fliers, and the National Eating Disorder Association online eating disorder screening test, which is available to anyone on the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/screening-tool"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Women who did not have an active eating disorder but had risk factors for one, like negative body image or excessive concern about their weight, were randomly assigned to either engage with the chatbot or sit on a waitlist. The chatbot offered eight conversations about topics around body image and healthy eating, and women who used the bot were encouraged to have two of the conversations each week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHodKf"&gt;At three- and six-month check-ins, women who talked to the chatbot had a bigger drop in concerns on a survey about their weight and body shape — a major risk factor for developing an eating disorder — than women in the waitlist group. The study, published in December in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Eating Disorders&lt;/em&gt;, also found some indication that women in the chatbot group were less likely to have developed a clinical eating disorder by the end of the six months than women in the waitlist group. “This could have a great public health impact if we can continue to find ways to disseminate it widely,” Fitzsimmons-Craft says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtAay8"&gt;This is one of the first studies testing the effectiveness of chatbots in healthcare, even though they’re widely used in medical settings to assist with everything from COVID-19 symptom screening to therapy. Research has lagged behind their use, but there’s a growing body of work highlighting the role they can play in some areas of healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hwdrh"&gt;Fitzimmons-Craft thinks chatbots like the one her team developed could be integrated with things like the National Eating Disorder Association screening tests, or in places — like colleges — where people are likely to start showing signs of an eating disorder. The chatbot isn’t designed for people who already have a clinical disorder, but people who show risk factors could be directed toward it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5g1Llq"&gt;It’s also possible to identify people who are at risk for an eating disorder through their web search history, Fitzimmons-Craft says, and likely through their behavior on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Those platforms are linked to body image issues for teen girls, research and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"&gt;whistleblower reports&lt;/a&gt; this fall continue to show. Partnering with platforms like Google or Instagram could help flag behaviors that shows someone is at risk, and pair them with the bot. “I think that’s absolutely worth exploring,” she says. “It’s ripe for identifying individuals who could use help with these issues and intervening on the spot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GENBNh"&gt;Chatbots could also be useful for other types of mental health issues where prevention is important, Fitzimmons-Craft says. They’re not going to be right for everyone or for every issue, but they’re a cheap tool and the barriers to entry are low. People who don’t have an active disorder might not want to do an intensive program, and it might be hard to get funding for involved prevention tools. But at-risk groups could still benefit by being nudged away from a potential problem, she says. “For someone who doesn’t really want or maybe even actively need help — in our study folks were high risk, they didn’t have a clinical problem — it might be just the right thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the latest iPad is a great deal at $105</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtgtrNkzrgN8FWwlJFSGgFuSYlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354229/jbareham_170609_1765_0077.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLPJzw"&gt;If you own Apple’s ninth Gen iPad, or the previous-gen iPad Air (pre-USB-C days), this Smart Keyboard is compatible — and selling for just about its lowest price yet at Woot. Normally $150 or so at most other retailers, you can snag this snap-on keyboard that covers your iPad’s screen when it’s not in use &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup010522/https://computers.woot.com/offers/apple-smart-keyboard-for-ipad-charcoal?ref=w_cnt_wp_2_27" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $104.99&lt;/a&gt;. This accessory also works with the seventh- and eighth-gen iPads, as well as the 10.5-inch iPad Pro from 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF2tws"&gt;This is a good price, and it comes with a one-year warranty through Apple. Though, it’s possible that you might want a keyboard for your iPad that offers a trackpad, too. Don’t worry, those exist, and buying one won’t cost you much more than this Smart Keyboard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;Brydge’s $129.99 10.2 Max Plus keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; delivers a solid typing experience, along with protection for every side of your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NUK2QJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bmJov2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXHOuC"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful, port-filled USB-C hub, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet/dp/B087QZVQJX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s 555 model is $67.99 right now&lt;/a&gt;, down 15 percent from its usual price. This model delivers eight ports, including an HDMI port (up to 4K at 60Hz refresh rate), USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 port (supporting 10Gbps speeds), USB-C PD for passthrough charging, two USB-A ports, 1Gbps ethernet jack, and  microSD and SD card readers. Notably, this USB-C hub can accept 100W of power, passing 85W of it to your laptop while reserving the rest of the power for any accessories you might want to plug into the Anker 555. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbqTla"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LB1IVy"&gt;This deal has been popular with new and existing Oculus Quest 2 headset owners: the Elite strap that makes wearing the headset more comfortable is $10 off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $39&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. We saw this deal first pop up right after Christmas, and it’s worth going for if you want a strap that offers more support for your VR marathons (or even just for your quick burst workouts, if that’s your thing). While you’re at it, you may want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this Oculus Quest 2 hard zip-up case&lt;/a&gt; to keep your headset protected while it’s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1uhJZe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sNyl3w"&gt;When it comes to gaming accessories, opting for a higher-performance piece of kit can make the difference in giving you that slight competitive edge — or it can just make you feel good. Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Series 2 controller perfectly encapsulates that. Maybe most of us are not talented enough to really need a pro-level controller, but tinkering with its swappable sticks, directional pads, optional rear paddles, and fine-tuning is just fun. This premium controller feels great, looks great, and you can tailor it to what fits your proclivities. It’s currently on sale for $139.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals010622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, matching its all-time low price that knocks $40 off MSRP. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLQuSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u74zsD"&gt;Extra deals for extra credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="I0A8s4"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion 3&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is down to $39.99 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Luigis-Mansion-3-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07SK4W1VJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That is close to the historical low price for a very good first-party Nintendo game starring everyone’s favorite Italian plumber’s brother (aside from me: Antonio). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IFEHFF"&gt;The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas 4 flight stick for PS5, PS4, and PC is $49.99 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmwzgNK6ei" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very affordable way to get into trying out flight sticks without jumping into more elaborate, expensive setups. While it’s built for PlayStation, you can install PC drivers that’ll make it compatible with the likes of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="le6tFV"&gt;If you shoot Fuji’s mirrorless X system, you can pick up the X-T30 on closeout sale at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifjxt30s.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals010622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; for $799 ($100 off). This camera is a little long in the tooth now, but it’s still a very capable model if you don’t need the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653712/fujifilm-gfx50sii-xt30ii-xf33-xf23-announced-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;X-T30 II&lt;/a&gt; that’s launching later this month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306026/fujifilm-xt30-camera-review-fuji-xt3-mirrorless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>BMW shows off huge 31-inch in-car screen to keep backseat passengers entertained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MXjg9Zq7X2rsj9Ie1qYhtmERsX0=/0x0:7941x5294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354054/P90448391_highRes_preview_of_the_in_ca.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osSXBL"&gt;BMW has revealed a &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0363131EN/bmw-theatre-screen-brings-cinematic-experience-into-the-vehicle"&gt;new in-car technology it’s calling Theatre Screen&lt;/a&gt; at this year’s CES. It’s not clear when or if this massive 31-inch, 32:9 display will be made available to consumers, but BMW suggests it can be fitted somehow into the ceiling of luxury cars, descending to transform the back seats into a “private cinema lounge.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urvdFq"&gt;The screen itself has an 8K resolution of roughly 8000 x 2000 and can play content with a 16:9, 21:9, or 32:9 aspect ratio. It’s running Amazon’s Fire OS operating system, which means it should have access to most modern video streaming services and other Fire TV apps that can stream over the car’s own 5G connection. It’s a touchscreen display, and there are also small touchpad controls built into the rear doors of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5by3ezboARhW4xnTL9oVx0Yq_QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149367/P90448391_highRes_preview_of_the_in_ca.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen is 31 inches big, with an aspect ratio of 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UwnCwl"&gt;Theatre Mode includes surround sound, of course, with a system consisting of over 30 speakers from Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins. BMW describes the sound as being “4D” because it includes speakers built into the rear seats themselves so viewers can feel the audio vibrations in more intense moments. When the screen descends from the ceiling, BMW says “the roller sunblinds for the side windows and the rear window are closed and the ambient lighting in the rear of the vehicle is dimmed.” Honestly, it sounds like an excellent way to watch a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnTCSM"&gt;BMW has a functioning prototype of the theater screen built into a car on the CES show floor with which &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2022/01/06/exclusive-demo-bmw-theater-screen-31-inch-and-8k-resolution/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMWBlog &lt;/em&gt;had&lt;/a&gt; a hands-on experience. The company attempted to obscure the exact model of the car the system was installed in, and wouldn’t answer questions about its identity, but &lt;em&gt;BMWBlog&lt;/em&gt; notes that it appears to be a part of the company’s luxury 7 Series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FI5eFt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNTTXG1mmxc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4WuY1H"&gt;The company has yet to announce when the system might be available to customers or how much it could end up costing. But during the company’s CES presentation, BMW’s presenter said that the features “look quite similar to what will be launched very soon in series production.” That suggests it might appear before BMW’s other big CES tech announcement, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867090/bmw-color-changing-paint-electric-car-ces"&gt;color-changing E Ink car&lt;/a&gt;, which it characterized as an “advanced research and design project.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re talking about Taco Bell’s new subscription service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tr9cC7EZWHfjRggEAIw5diivEFo=/211x0:2179x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353958/Screen_Shot_2022_01_05_at_11.15.31.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten bucks could get you 30 tacos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Taco Bell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OFTGl"&gt;Taco Bell has &lt;a href="https://www.tacobell.com/promotions/taco-lovers-pass"&gt;announced a subscription&lt;/a&gt; that lets you redeem one taco per day for 30 days, and it’s called the Taco Lover’s Pass. The way it works is simple: you pay $10 for the pass in Taco Bell’s app and get access to a secret menu that lets you pick which taco you’ll like to redeem at a participating location. You’ll be able to get a single taco per day and can choose from the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nCrtVu"&gt;Crunchy Taco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DL2uHa"&gt;Crunchy Taco Supreme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oPmnNC"&gt;Soft Taco &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gi9oH6"&gt;Soft Taco Supreme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CNXXT1"&gt;Spicy Potato Soft Taco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FBJxbQ"&gt;Doritos Locos Tacos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TjRgSw"&gt;Doritos Locos Tacos Supreme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2D43Eh"&gt;(We at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; had a lot of thoughts about this program, and we’ll get to those shortly. But first, let me just say that I find this a little insulting, economically speaking — the Doritos Locos Taco Supreme costs $2.69 at my local Taco Bell, where the Spicy Potato Soft Taco costs $1. Someone who prefers potatoes is getting way less for their money than someone who’s locos for Doritos. Okay, yes, I could technically still get 30 tacos for $10, but the &lt;em&gt;principle&lt;/em&gt; of it...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PObFrO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pass is a one-time purchase, available for “an extended limited time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCBEsS"&gt;The program isn’t necessarily a subscription &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; — Taco Bell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email that “[the] Taco Lover’s Pass will be available as a one-time purchase but can be re-purchased when the original 30 days is over.” It also said that it’ll be available “for an extended limited time.” Given that you’ll be able to re-up, though, I’d count that as a subscription, albeit one you have to do manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDUWKd"&gt;As with all good news stories, this story sparked discourse and passion in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack room — probably more than Catie Keck expected when she dropped it in the news channel. After we determined that we weren’t experiencing déjà vu (there was &lt;a href="https://people.com/food/taco-bell-taco-lovers-subscription/"&gt;news about this program last year&lt;/a&gt;, when Taco Bell trialed it in Arizona), we had a discussion that was too good to not share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGifFX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Ricker:&lt;/strong&gt; what credit cards are to debt, this is to obesity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADwhPm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Lawler:&lt;/strong&gt; nah thomas taco bell goes right through you. scientifically not fattening at all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2psUxq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m literally loling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjlxQF"&gt;(Please note that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s science team hasn’t vetted Richard’s claims, and you shouldn’t take them as fact without proof. Always consult with a doctor before starting a new diet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBCSzw"&gt;Bravely (and unfortunately at the same time Thomas made a dire prediction), I opened myself up to ridicule by showing that I have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pizza_suplex/status/824765101295157249"&gt;the live mas mentality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDvwtO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; fast food subscriptions are end point US capitalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCm1Uz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; I might... buy this. It’s like &lt;a href="https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html"&gt;Panera’s coffee thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3doM83"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catie:&lt;/strong&gt; i dont think ive had taco bell in over a decade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQT0rW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard:&lt;/strong&gt; you only get one taco a day though&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHllSC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; who eats just one taco&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PufltM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; YOu will absolutely have to buy one or two more. But that first taco is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UovVU6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean it was only like $1.19 to begin with but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVdcdu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catie:&lt;/strong&gt; okay but how often are u rly buying taco bell tho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ABega8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“okay but how often are u rly buying taco bell tho”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaAkWE"&gt;Jay Peters then jumped in to remind Catie that I had revealed my Taco Bell weakness a few minutes earlier, and Dan Seifert chimed in with “taco bell? more like toxic hell, amirite!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDv0qM"&gt;I, of course, was forced to respond with facts and logic to defend my honor and the good name of multi-billion dollar conglomerate Yum! Brands (the company behind Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kowU8U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; I have one excuse: Vegetarianism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5ZOHu"&gt;Okay, so maybe it was more of a mealy-mouthed excuse (as one might expect from someone who dines at the Bell). But I can always count on Richard to have my back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfpZg2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard:&lt;/strong&gt; taco bell is ideal for that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2f7BPL"&gt;Others also chimed in about their Taco Bell habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3Q9sy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandon Widder:&lt;/strong&gt; i go to taco bell maybe once a month, but never before midnight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnGXxy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan:&lt;/strong&gt; i frequently get the taco bell cravings but then i’m too lazy to go get it. so it’s been years since i’ve had it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpMhqs"&gt;Finally, of course, came the inevitable discussion of what we call Taco Bell’s food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXBbx8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; can we put taco in “” since it’s only an approximation? Taco Bell “taco”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyerAY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s legitimate taco bell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qv06A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Name redacted for fear of ruining Brand]:&lt;/strong&gt; which is not legitimate “food” or “taco” or “edible”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV7QqS"&gt;I then shared that my placeholder headline for this story was “Let’s Taco ‘bout the Bell.” Jay reacted with a thumbs down emoji, Dan said “Let’s give em something to Taco ’bout” (which put my idea to shame, so I stole it), and Thomas informed us that he was muting the thread. As far as I’m aware, none of us went to get Taco Bell. Maybe I’ll think about it when the pass rolls out tomorrow though.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The US secretary of transportation wants to talk about innovation, infrastructure, and electric vehicles — and a little about Tesla&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iT7h5E"&gt;It’s something of a tradition for the US secretary of transportation to address the annual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas and talk about all the ways that the government hopes to foster innovation in technology and transportation. This year, despite surging cases of omicron putting a damper on the show, Pete Buttigieg held up the tradition, delivering a virtual speech outlining his department’s new innovation principles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ot8C6"&gt;2021 was an eventful year for Buttigieg, the youngest and arguably the most notable person to take on the role of transportation secretary in many years. Congress passed President &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;Joe Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan&lt;/a&gt;, which will provide billions of new funding for the creation of a national network of electric vehicle charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMuzhE"&gt;Buttigieg will have some say in how those billions of dollars get spent. He also has regulatory oversight of a rapidly changing auto industry, where electrification and automation are upending decades of transportation habits in the US. And he has to make sure those new technologies are rolled out safely and effectively, against the backdrop of rising carbon emissions and a spike in reckless driving and traffic fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLtlgH"&gt;And of course,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tesla"&gt; we had to talk about Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, the company responsible for two-thirds of all EV sales in the US and the one that’s most aggressively pushing the promise of self-driving cars — despite not actually selling any self-driving cars. Biden doesn’t like saying the “T-word,” but Buttigieg isn’t as reserved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB4lPd"&gt;So here’s Pete Buttigieg, secretary of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nTBF5n"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3832094625" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVJSHw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary Pete Buttigieg, welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I wanted to start by asking you about these innovation principles that you’re announcing at CES. What are they? Why do you think they’re important? Why should people care about a government agency’s “innovation principles?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wriEHx"&gt;You can’t separate transportation from innovation. As our department is making decisions about the future of transportation, the idea is to make sure that we’ve codified the principles that are going to guide us. Folks in our department have been working on innovation since the department was created. Some of these things are principles that have been unspoken for a very long time, but I think it’s very important for us to take a step back and take stock about what matters to us most when it comes to innovation. Otherwise, there’s always a risk of innovation being confused with technology. They’re not the same thing. We’re also trying to avoid technology as an end in itself, which is why the very first principle we’ve laid out is that our involvement in innovation is supposed to serve and support public policy priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="7UevvT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GTUQRE"&gt;Some of the things we care about are: helping people get to where they need to be, making sure that people live in a way that is prosperous on equitable terms, dealing with the climate crisis, and supporting good-paying American jobs. These are things we care about in general, so it follows that these should be some of the priorities that guide our choices when we’re getting involved in the innovation space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTn1V5"&gt;Competitiveness for America in the 21st century is another important one for us. We are at a crossroads in terms of American leadership. A lot of times, competitiveness is talked about in geopolitical terms, but it’s just as true in terms of transportation, technology, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqKm3t"&gt;Our support for workers is another priority: ensuring that this is not about technology that comes at the expense of workers, but rather empowering workers. How can we make workers more effective, more successful, and even more productive in ways that benefit the economy as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5fOev"&gt;We have a principle here about allowing experimentation and learning from failure. This is so elemental in the tech space that it might be questioned why we would even put it down, but it can be a little bit foreign in the government space, where failure is often not tolerated, even though it’s clearly in the experimental context. Failure is a necessary part of how innovation happens. We’ve got a principle that lays out how important collaboration is — the fact that it’s not just the public sector, just the private sector or just the academic sector that drives innovation, but how those sectors relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlJWiZ"&gt;Lastly — but importantly — we’re prioritizing being ready to adapt, to be flexible, and to evolve. Again, not something that is second nature, especially for a regulatory agency. Regulation is a big part of what the DOT [Department of Transportation] does, but we obviously need to be adaptable because the technologies are literally changing faster than we can rewrite some of our own plans and rules around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZasldA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I definitely want to discuss that last part because it is really important. Before we do that, though, I wanted to ask you about the ways that you feel the recently passed infrastructure law will help foster innovation. Last I checked, there isn’t a lot of wiggle room when it comes to filling potholes or building bridges or updating sewer systems. Can you give us just some examples of ways you think that these innovation principles will dovetail with the new infrastructure law?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lQv5II"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t need to invent a new electric vehicle charger.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4aMvaB"&gt;One definite example is the deployment of a nationwide network of electric vehicle chargers. It’s a good example of the role of the government: we don’t need to invent a new electric vehicle charger. The private sector has come up with a lot of versions of it. We don’t even need to deploy electric vehicle chargers ourselves single-handedly in a network that’s owned and operated by the government. Again, the private sector is there for that, but we have a very important role to play in terms of making sure that a network is laid out across this country for everybody; that this infrastructure isn’t just in the most immediately profitable places, but also in the places that, collectively, add up to eliminating range anxiety for any American anywhere who is weighing whether to buy an electric vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kLtD4"&gt;That means filling in for market failures. It means accelerating market processes. It means using the purchasing power and guidelines that are available to the federal government to encourage made-in-America components and facilities to thrive in the EV charging space. It’s a great example of where you need this handshake between public and private — not in order to make sure that a technology exists, but in order to help make sure that the way that technology unfolds is the most beneficial to the American people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8k8GHe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will this involve pressuring private companies to put EV chargers in places that may not necessarily result in the biggest financial return, but will help the more equitable distribution of chargers so that the United States can build a more robust infrastructure overall?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wykPac"&gt;When you want a company to do something that’s not in their shareholder interest, there’s got to be more to the picture than pressure. That’s why this is about using billions of dollars to achieve that outcome, but we’re not going to just use those dollars to incentivize something that would’ve happened anyway, to pad profitabilities that would exist regardless. So, yes, it’s about smoothing that picture. Right now, you can make a buck putting an electric vehicle charger in a lot of places in the US, but those places might not make the biggest difference in terms of our development into an EV country. Or in terms of our public policy goals, which include making sure low-income people can access them. Low-income people — provided they can afford an EV — would benefit the most, because they can have the fuel savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6PnP6"&gt;It’s a different pattern of use than you might expect. Rural residents are often left out of a lot of technology developments, but because they are more likely to live in a single-family home, they are more likely to have at least part of the charging issue solved: a plug in your wall at home is how you can charge your car. That solution is actually less available to city residents. Some other things are harder for rural residents compared to city residents, like the long distances rural residents have to cover. It’s an example of the Department of Transportation figuring out how we can use our policy tools to ensure a good public outcome, even while there’s a lot of market activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JGFuxX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We could be doing a lot more to drive adoption of pavement that lasts longer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mNkv34"&gt;Over time, you want to organize yourself out of a job, as the saying goes. We want to get to where less and less policy intervention is needed for the good outcome to happen. The EV charging network is one example, but there are others where we do have a role in basic research. You mentioned that there’s only so many ways you can fill in a pothole, but actually — and I have a bit of an obsession about this — we could be doing a lot more to drive adoption of pavement that lasts longer. Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of market incentives, or, frankly, even policy incentives, for the people who make these choices day-to-day, like mayors or state DOTs, to pay a premium for an asphalt that’s going to last 13 years instead of nine in a Midwestern winter. We should be federally funding basic research like that because it probably won’t happen otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMB09l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see. I asked about potholes because I knew you were going to “but actually” me on it, so I set you up for that. Thank you for taking the bait. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tI79nb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going back to the EV charging question: the bipartisan infrastructure deal will provide $7 billion for charging infrastructure. However, the other tax credits and consumer incentives are still tied up with the Build Back Better plan, which is in limbo right now. Are you making plans at the DOT level to come up with some other way to speed the transition from gas-powered vehicles to EVs, assuming that we won’t get those improved customer incentives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ66Jd"&gt;Three things are really going to drive adoption. One is the charging support that we just talked about. The second is the incentives that we’re committing to try to deliver, hopefully through the Build Back Better framework, but whatever the vehicle, it’s an important public policy. Third is the developments that will happen anyway in the market. Of course, the worry is that the market forces won’t get there in time for us to meet our climate goals, which is why we’ve got to pour some accelerant on it. Now I should say — and I’ve noticed there’s been a little bit of confusion, almost to the point of misinformation, about this in the press — electric vehicles are increasingly moving toward a price point that’s available to more and more Americans. A widely cited figure is the $55,000 average price, but like many averages, there can be some mischief in those statistics because they include a lot of very high-end luxury vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbdB0r"&gt;Some of these pickup trucks coming onto the market start around $40,000, which is still out of reach for a lot of people, but that is more affordable than anything in this space would’ve been a few years ago. Our task is to make EVs affordable more quickly for more people, which is why we’ve proposed this incentive that would take more than $10,000 off of that price tag, moving it into the high 20s. More Americans would be able to afford these vehicles and reap the fuel savings that come with them. We’re not going to let go of this policy goal of reducing the upfront cost to electric vehicles, even while we pursue other initiatives that are going to make them easier to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvjVS8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting point. We have seen the president testing out the electric Hummer and the electric Ford F-150. Those vehicles are presented as being the tip of the spear to more adoption. But, if you pull the camera back a little bit even more, there is an issue of car dependency in the United States: car dependency drives increases in carbon emissions and troubling increases of pedestrian road fatalities. How can you use your regulatory authority to pressure states to reduce car dependency? We hear a lot about the importance of electric vehicles, but we don’t hear as much about the broader problems that are associated with car dependency in the US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpgAxQ"&gt;Our lives are set up to revolve around our use of cars in so many ways. Our work starts from the principle that every means of transportation, including cars, should revolve around everyday life and what’s good for people, not the other way around. That is a challenge. We’re very excited about the developments that are happening with the automotive space becoming cleaner through electrification, smarter through automation, but cars are only one of many ways to get around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIHrGD"&gt;I often say that you should be able to have options to get to where you’re going without having to drag two tons of metal with you in order to get there. This bipartisan infrastructure law is history’s largest ever federal investment in public transit, to create those kinds of options for people, and to get out of this idea that transit is something you’re stuck with if you don’t have a car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfi81g"&gt;That’s already true in many of our biggest cities, but we could do a lot more to make that the case and to make that equally true of bus transit as it is of subway or train transit. Then we ensure that it is safer and more convenient to get around on foot; encouraging active transportation and bicycle mobility. That begins with safety and making sure that people are safe when they’re getting around with those modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXQRnx"&gt;Some of this is about what we think of as the transportation piece. Some of this is about city planning and urban design. That’s one of the reasons why we can’t separate transportation policy from housing policy and land use policy. We have designed everything — down to the way our neighborhoods and cities unfold — in a way that almost pushes us into this car dependency, when we really could have a more balanced outlook. A lot of forward-thinking communities, cities, and states are planning that way already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUFuKU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In some ways, these innovation principles reminded me a little bit of the voluntary guidelines that were released for automated vehicles under the Obama administration: a list of broad policies and principles that the government would like to see private companies adopt as they move more toward this technological innovation, self-driving cars. That’s one element of what the government can do to incentivize this innovation in the private sector. On the other hand is the enforcement angle. Companies like Tesla are really pushing the envelope about auto safety: having customers test out beta software. Is there more that the DOT, NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration], and other government agencies should be doing in order to ensure that companies aren’t pursuing innovation, compromising our safety in the process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RevPNN"&gt;The innovation agenda is the bleeding edge of what we’re doing as an agency, but the core of the DOT is safety. When I talk about how technology and innovation should serve our public policy priorities, a good example of that is our core mission around safety. That mission isn’t just about being excited about new things emerging that could be beneficial, but also a fundamental responsibility on the regulatory side. You are going to continue to see us take steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdX8wO"&gt;By the way, in the long run, this is to the benefit of industry in the same way that food service and restaurants are better off because America chose to establish public health regulations so you didn’t have to worry about food poisoning every time you ate outside of your home — or inside your home, for that matter. We need to make sure that people who are weighing how to navigate a world of automated vehicles know that there is some baseline of safety that’s been established by regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nwyqn"&gt;The challenge for us is to adapt our framework for regulating these things in ways we’ve never had to. There’s an unofficial division of labor when it comes to vehicles and vehicle safety, which is that — and I’m simplifying a little bit, but I think this is a fair way to say it — the states regulate drivers and the federal government regulates cars. What are you supposed to do when the car is the driver? That’s an issue that we’re really just at the outset of managing. In a much narrower sense, even right now, we just had to rewrite some of our regulations on what should be true in terms of language that refers to a “driver’s seat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRMQDI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That process can take such a long time. As we’ve seen in the past, tweaking things like the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards is a multiyear process that doesn’t seem to really account for the pace at which this technology is innovating. GM is announcing today that they’re going to start selling self-driving cars to customers by the middle part of the decade. We don’t even have vision tests for these cars yet. Do we need something like that? We test drivers’ eyesight, so should we be testing the perception software of these cars as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri5Zfu"&gt;Potentially. These are exactly the kinds of things we need to really move more quickly as a government to deal with. We can’t let technology keep running out ahead of our policy or else one of two things will happen: either it emerges and it’s not safe, or it’s ready to emerge and is held back because we haven’t gotten around to finding ways to ensure that it’s safe. Both of those outcomes are bad, but also, we need to think at a deeper level than we have been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="gKy8Vn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Human drivers kill about 35,000 people a year. We would never tolerate that with any kind of new product or technology, so it’s got to be better.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s5B0Ik"&gt;Not to pounce on it, but your example about vision testing is a good one. There’s this idea out there that we’ve got to make sure that the vision or optical capabilities of AVs is as good as that of a human driver, but I don’t think that’s an acceptable standard. Human drivers kill about 35,000 people a year. We would never tolerate that with any kind of new product or technology, so it’s got to be better. It’s not the government’s job to decide whether the way to make it better is an even better optical approach or some other solution. These are exactly the kinds of things that researchers in the scientific and industry world will need to develop, not people like me. What we need to say is: “Here’s what a safe vehicle looks like. Here’s an acceptable standard of safety. Here’s what it takes to accept that these will be on American roads.” Then the race is on to define those principles and challenge industry to show that they can meet that standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfdY6X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will that involve being unafraid to use the recall authority? Companies can fix potential defects in their vehicles through over-the-air software updates, bypassing the traditional recall process. Does that need to be updated in some way to account for how cars are — to use a cliche that’s been bandied about — essentially just smartphones on wheels? It seems like software updates could potentially present some issues for government regulators such as yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nLZRt"&gt;If a model of a tire explodes when it’s not supposed to, that obviously triggers a recall due to a physical flaw. If there is a flaw in a piece of software that could have comparable consequences, we need to have a way to get ahead of it. That’s something that requires us to build fundamentally different capabilities than we’re used to having as an agency, but there’s no question that we need to be weighing these issues, not just for those purposes, but to prepare for a world where cybersecurity vulnerabilities are becoming more apparent and troubling. Up to this point, the approach has been hoping that private actors will give the government a heads-up when there’s a cyber issue. We must have a more robust way of dealing with these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgW9K1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You could hope that private companies will give you the heads-up. I don’t mean to continue to bring up Tesla, but I have to. They do seem to be an outlier in the auto industry in the way that Elon Musk thumbs his nose at regulators, whether it’s the SEC or NHTSA. Obviously, the government is investigating the incidents in which &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla’s Autopilot crashed into emergency vehicles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but do you think that there needs to be a more broader look at that company, especially considering the unique role that they’re playing in the broader transportation sector?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SwbW4X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will regulate any company based on whether their products are safe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfiSS3"&gt;Our decisions are based on outcomes. We will regulate any company based on whether their products are safe. We are taking steps now with NHTSA to make sure that we get the needed data about incidents that use some of this driver assistance technology. I keep saying this until I’m blue in the face: anything on the market today that you can buy is a driver assistance technology, not a driver replacement technology. I don’t care what it’s called. We need to make sure that we’re crystal clear about that — even if companies are not. Existing authorities will give us a lot to work with to keep drivers and passengers safe. We’re going to continue to use those in every responsible way and look for more running room where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeMzZD"&gt;It’s not about singling out any one company for praise or for scrutiny. It’s about ensuring that every single vehicle out there meets a basic standard of safety, so you don’t even have to wonder about it. You can worry more about the cool stuff like which features you want instead of wondering whether this vehicle can be trusted with your life and the lives of your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhZfUf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to ask you a little bit about trust in government: it seems to be at a low at this point in the country. There’s a feeling that the government’s not really working for people. Some of that distrust stems from the jobs that some government officials take after they leave public service; for example, a lot of folks who worked at the DOT under President Obama went on to join tech companies after they left the agency. Does that revolving door situation hurt the ability of agencies like yours to properly regulate the sector?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHi3tg"&gt;There are a lot of ethics rules that try to create a level of transparency around any relationship people have before, during, and after their time in government and in industry. We should always be ready to refine and improve those rules to make sure that there’s no question about what’s motivating people making decisions in public service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7nX0Y"&gt;At its core, the most important factor driving trust in government, up or down, is results. People trust government when it works for them and they mistrust government when they witness policy failure. The irony of being a safety agency at our core is that policy successes tend to be quiet. One fiery crash is a lot more visible than 100,000 that didn’t happen because we did our job. That’s by design. Part of me says that I want public servants to get more credit for keeping the public safe, but part of why we’re here is to worry about that stuff so you don’t have to. But there are other areas where clearly people have not seen policy success, including in transportation, largely as a consequence of the generational disinvestment that’s been going on through my lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHG2GH"&gt;That’s why we’re so excited about the bipartisan infrastructure law. It is an opportunity — not a guarantee — to deliver the kinds of quality infrastructural improvements that are going to make people feel better about the country, and feel better about the government that’s in charge of delivering it. It’s not an exaggeration to say that confidence in democracy partly depends on some very nuts-and-bolts stuff like whether we can deliver good, efficient, safe, modern ways for people and goods to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfrTYO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the last question for you. You and your husband just became parents — mazel tov to that. Do you think your children will need to have driver’s licenses when they get old enough to have one? In the past, a lot of autonomous vehicle proponents would claim that future generations won’t need to have driver’s licenses. Now there’s some question as to whether or not those claims were maybe a bit premature. What are your thoughts on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="779TUy"&gt;I was thinking about that just the other day when I was looking at them in the morning. I mean, getting a driver’s license was such a big deal for anybody my age or older growing up. Driving is already a bit less of a thing if you talk to teenagers now because, among other things, rideshares have been so liberating for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K65DOL"&gt;My kids were born last summer. Fifteen years from now, getting a driver’s license will very much be an optional thing or a specialty thing. Now, that being said, I’m very mindful of the fact that the widespread use of automated cars has been “five years away” for at least the last decade in terms of the conversations that you see happening among the more breathless commentators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVqg3c"&gt;For that to go through some kind of step change requires both policy and technology to evolve in a way that’s different than it has been. If electric vehicles are as big of a change — to use an analogy from aviation — as going from propellers to jet planes, then I think automated vehicles on the ground will be as big a difference as going from air travel to space travel. It’s clearly going to happen in a big way in our lifetimes. Trying to game out exactly when is a little harder for any of us to do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBNdec"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many companies have gotten tripped up in the past when trying to accurately predict the future. It seems to be a moving target. Secretary Pete Buttigieg, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate your time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="J6rbU0"&gt;Thanks for having me on. Good seeing you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Target is selling PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1_AiLax52Z5u79nUdUv2PEaxFE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353927/vpavic_4261_20201023_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BTR7KZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:46AM ET, January 6th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Target has sold out of consoles for now. We hope you had some luck on your side today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCKCq5"&gt;For those who have yet to nab a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, today Target is giving you another shot. The retailer listings are live for the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock"&gt;$399.99 PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. Target does their restocks early in the morning, where listings come online and read as “Sold out” before they go live and the Add to Cart button appears — which is any moment now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ihp6f8"&gt;To make sure you have the best chance at landing the console, make sure you’re signed into your Target account, with preloaded payment information, and double-check that your billing and shipping address is current. All of these steps won’t guarantee you’ll be able to get a console, but it will certainly reduce the time it takes to check out and possibly nab one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUUNRf"&gt;Also, as these Target orders are usually for in-store pickup, keep attempting to add items to the cart even if it initially fails when you click the button. Your local stores may load their available stock a few minutes later, or reload it in waves. Once you do manage to add it to your cart, be sure to checkout immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0MSo"&gt;If you don’t manage to get one today, don’t give up. Some members of our own team only managed to finally land their consoles of choice after repeated attempts. We will also continue posting updates as more restocks happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jBnOb"&gt;In the meantime, we’re happy to save you money on everyday purchases – which include the hottest video games, gaming peripherals, and more – so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Our team has also included some great gaming accessories below you can enjoy in the meantime as well, some of which are even on sale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eufy’s new video doorbell uses two cameras to catch porch pirates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k-i9nnZmX6InG3CGFG83N-ahN5o=/375x0:2625x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346347/eufy_doorbell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual uses two cameras to keep an eye on your front door.﻿&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YV40dq"&gt;Eufy, Anker’s smart home brand, is trying to solve the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;video doorbell’s&lt;/a&gt; biggest blindspot with a new dual-camera option. The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual has two cameras: a 2K camera up top to capture the face and body of a visitor and a 1080p camera down below to monitor packages left on the doorstep. At CES 2022 this week, the company also announced a new Garage Cam, which is a garage door controller and camera in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL0wes"&gt;The concept of two cameras in a video doorbell is an interesting one, helping solve the problem most camera doorbells have where they either show you a tall, skinny video so you can see packages as well as people, but not much context outside that. Or, you get a wide view that gives more context but misses out on the doorstep itself, where those packages normally are. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuhX9PWGmta_8OEuHu1uDXMnBFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145629/eufy_Video_Doorbell_Dual___product_image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eufy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Dual is a battery-powered video doorbell with two cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="En1xM2"&gt;This Eufy Video Doorbell Dual, which costs $260, including the required Homebase 2 (a standalone version will also be available if you already have a hub), is not the first to attempt this type of two-camera solution. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetkuna.com%2Fproducts%2Fanswer-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kuna Maximus Answer&lt;/a&gt; also does double duty. However, that’s a hardwired doorbell; Eufy’s version is the first battery-powered buzzer to try this trick (Eufy says a hardwired version is also in the works). Its downward-facing 1080p camera has a 120-degree field of view, while the 2K camera can see as wide as 160 degrees. It also has AI that can detect packages, plus a new “Family Recognition” feature that uses AI to recognize friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlBYcT"&gt;In addition to dual cameras, the doorbell has dual motion detection, using radar and PIR technology to detect people versus motion and reduce false alerts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKwxTY"&gt;As with all Eufy cameras, there is no required monthly subscription fee. When paired with a Eufy hub — the HomeBase 2 — 16GB of local storage provides up to 90 days of video recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLaA2Z"&gt;The Eufy Dual should last up to six months on a charge, and based on my testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464940/eufy-anker-solocam-security-cameras-local-storage-battery-no-hub"&gt;Eufy cameras&lt;/a&gt; in the past, this battery life largely pans out. Although if you have a very busy front door, it’s more like four months. However, the addition of a second camera could have a significant impact on battery life. Prior &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.eufylife.com%2Fproducts%2Fe82101w3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy battery-operated doorbells&lt;/a&gt; could be used wired as well; we’ve asked the company if this is also the case with the Dual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hn6Omb"&gt;The Eufy Dual will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt; smart home platforms and is scheduled to launch on February 8th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwUYR6oC1pOkYxUT7M5kB3cSDaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145622/Garage_Control_Cam.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eufy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Garage-Control Cam combines a garage door controller and camera into one device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5j9knQ"&gt;The other new product announced this week is the Eufy Security Garage-Control Cam and the Cam Plus. These are all-in-one garage control and surveillance devices that can be used to remotely open / close the garage door, as well as visually check in on your garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mSJXT"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam offers 1080p video and can control one door, and the Cam Plus has 2K video and can control up to two doors. They both pair with door sensors to detect the status of the door and send an alert if you forget to close it. The device also needs to be hardwired to your existing garage door opener, but details on which garage door manufacturers the product will be compatible with haven’t been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1duZ7d"&gt;As with other garage door controllers — such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chamberlain.com%2Fmyq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chamberlain’s MyQ &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://gotailwind.com/"&gt;Tailwind IQ3&lt;/a&gt; — the Garage-Control Cam lets you open and close your garage door remotely using the app or with voice control. Eufy also has the option of geofencing detection, so you can set the door to open or close as you arrive or leave home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTatIS"&gt;Both Cam devices can distinguish between humans, vehicles, and general motion using on-device AI, and they don’t require a Eufy hub. Instead, 32GB of local storage using an SD card provides video recordings with no monthly cloud storage fees. The cameras also support 24/7 continuous recording with a 4-second pre-roll feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx56hU"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam (1080P/ single-door control) will cost $99 and the Garage-Control Cam Plus (2K/ two-door control) $129, and both are expected to launch in March of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BUZJh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Thursday, January 6th, 7:30 AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Added details on the availability of a wired version of the Eufy Dual and a standalone version if you already have a hub. Also, clarified that the Garage-Control Cams need to be hardwired to a garage door controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IdMYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, Thursday, January 6th, 7:30 AM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; An earlier version of this article misstated the price of the Eufy Dual, it is expected to be $260. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel announces 5.5Ghz capable 12th Gen CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elMZxwcD2czxXOi3YxQ2HEn3Vbw=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353821/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_10.44.35_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGgrSK"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866452/intel-amd-cpu-ces-2022-core-i9-12900ks-ryzen-processor"&gt;teasing the news earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Intel has officially announced a new 12th-gen desktop CPU that’s capable of boosting to 5.5GHz on a single core out of the box. The news came during &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRDkmmjvuM"&gt;Intel’s CES 2022 presentation&lt;/a&gt;, when it said the KS-series desktop processor would be shipping later this quarter, but there was no mention of pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qr5fna"&gt;The full name of the chip is the Core i9-12900KS, and &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-displays-core-i912900ks-with-55-ghz-boost-clock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; the “S’’ suffix suggests it’ll be a limited edition. As well as hitting a maximum of 5.5GHz on a single core (a 300MHz improvement over what we saw with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763042/intel-core-i9-12900k-review"&gt;i9-12900K&lt;/a&gt;), an onstage demonstration of the new CPU powering &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; showed the processor running at a sustained 5.2GHz across all its performance cores. No details were given on what sort of power draw or cooling solution was needed to achieve these results.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YMo2Mu"&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn’t sound like you’ll be able to buy Intel’s 5.5GHz CPU for your own rig anytime soon. Intel executive vice president Gregory Bryant noted only that the CPU would be shipping to “OEM customers” during the presentation suggesting that, in the immediate future, you’ll have to buy a prebuilt PC to get your hands on one of the chips. As well as this new top-of-the-line CPU, Intel also used its CES presentation to announce a range of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866533/intel-12th-gen-cpu-alder-lake-mainstream-consumer-desktops-ces-2022"&gt;mainstream desktop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;laptop 12th Gen CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32zktFFnAMLjHdM6OpQD25akSMk=/0x0:1566x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353729/s22_lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, S22 Plus, and S22.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Unbox Therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAWmRy"&gt;A video from Unbox Therapy has shown off what appears to be three dummy units of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S22 series of phones, giving an early look at the design of the handsets. Although the video has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qhk3Wfc3Ps"&gt;now been delisted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHJ34Bbu8OI"&gt;reuploaded on other channels&lt;/a&gt;, and a screenshot was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/05/galaxy-s22-size-leak-video/"&gt;taken by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The video emerged alongside other details of the upcoming phones, including camera specs, and images of a new fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUhauT"&gt;This isn’t the first time footage of Galaxy S22 dummy units has leaked online. Twitter leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1470530973712498692"&gt;OnLeaks posted similar footage&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of last month. Unbox Therapy’s video appears to corroborate these previous designs, and also shows the handsets more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TDpQqH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well, OK... &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Plus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Plus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Ultra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dummy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Dummy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/CD8rnHhStx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CD8rnHhStx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1470530973712498692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Do48z1"&gt;The three handsets shown in Unbox Therapy’s video are thought to be the S22 Ultra, the S22 Plus, and the regular S22, though these names may not be final. The S22 and S22 Plus appear to have similar designs to last year’s S21 devices, with camera bumps across the top left side of their backs. Both dummy units appear to have triple camera setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWMgTH"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224"&gt;leaked spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; suggests the regular S22 will have a more compact 6.1-inch display (the S21, for reference, had a 6.2-inch display). This compares to a reported &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-design-renders-exclusive/"&gt;6.55-inch display for the S22 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Previous reports suggest &lt;a href="https://zouton.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s22-2021-exclusive-launch-edition-price-renders-design"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; will have a 50-megapixel main camera paired with extra ultra wide and telephoto cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgt6ft"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First Look at Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra / S22 Specs Sheet!   Introducing  SuperClear Lens!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/nyEFGrPtAH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nyEFGrPtAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zaryab Khan (@xeetechcare) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NfK032"&gt;In line with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;previous leak from last month&lt;/a&gt;, the S22 Ultra appears to have a very Galaxy Note-style design, with a squared off top and bottom and a built-in holder for an S Pen stylus. There’s also no camera bump around the phone’s reported four cameras. A leaked spec sheet suggests these will consist of a primary 108-megapixel sensor, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, and a 10-megapixel 10x periscope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DsWeo"&gt;Interestingly, the spec sheet mentions that this main 108-megapixel sensor could have a lens made of “Super Clear Glass,” which appears to be branding for some kind of Gorilla Glass. In an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orxS9qJsRkY&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;accompanying video&lt;/a&gt; to the spec sheet leak, Zaryab Khan speculates that this new lens could be designed to reduce the appearance of small bright dots that can appear in camera footage taken at night (a problem we’ve had &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/71m3SDGa220?t=760"&gt;with the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, for example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdi283"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has shared images of what appears to be a fast-charger for the S22 Ultra. It’s 45W and has just a single USB-C charging port, which suggests we might be looking at an increase in charging speeds compared to the 25W S21 Ultra (Samsung previously offered 45W charging on the Note 10 Plus). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U3thqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's that 45W PD Charger for your new S22 Ultra (EP-T4510)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the pic I posted a while back for this was obviously the wrong one. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jZw8Gu4Giq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jZw8Gu4Giq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meDhOD"&gt;It’s currently unclear exactly when these phones might all be announced. Samsung launched the S21 series in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;mid-January last year&lt;/a&gt;, but has typically opted for February launches for previous lineups. Given ongoing supply chain issues and a global chip shortage, it’s anyone’s guess as to when the S22 handsets may eventually make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black + Decker’s $300 Bev vacuums up a Keurig-shaped hole in the robot bartender space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IeHs4igbtdXT-hIrQjsnfRvQn8Q=/2x0:4598x3064/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353256/bev_rendering_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ddnJ00"&gt;What if instead of coffee, your Keurig dispensed alcoholic drinks? Well, Keurig actually made a gadget like that — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/13/18088118/keurig-drinkworks-cocktail-pods-k-cup-beer-bar"&gt;a $300 cocktail-making pod machine called the Drinkworks Home Bar&lt;/a&gt; that turned disposable pods into cold beverages. Only Keurig and Anheuser-Busch &lt;a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/keurig-for-cocktails-abruptly-decides-to-shutter-operations/611684/"&gt;mysteriously shut down&lt;/a&gt; that venture just three weeks ago, going so far as to appoint a settlement administrator &lt;a href="https://www.drinkworksrefundprogram.com/home/documents/"&gt;to offer refunds&lt;/a&gt;. Which leaves a perfect space in the market for a competitor to step in: Black &amp;amp; Decker of dustbuster, power tool and small kitchen appliance fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GqmUC"&gt;The $300 Black + Decker Bev is coming this spring with what might be the most practical (and least stylish) take on the robot bartender yet. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/barsys-automated-cocktail-maker-review/"&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bartesian.com/products/the-bartesian"&gt;competitor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mixologiq.com/en/"&gt;I could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kolice-automatic-cocktail-bartender-universal/dp/B08R8PJ6X6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; on the web, it &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; looks like a low-end Keurig, only with five stainless steel straws to suck the alcohol out of five standard 750ml liquor bottles of your choice. No need for custom bottles, no need to turn the bottles upside-down and potentially make a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNKh96"&gt;You load it up with tequila, rum, vodka, gin and whiskey bottles, fill the water container, pop in a pod containing the juices and bitters, and hit a button corresponding to the desired strength of your drink. Then, an internal pump draws out digitally measured quantities of each liquid, uses pressure to shove them into the capsule and mix them, valves direct excess liquor back to each bottle uncontaminated, the drink pours into your glass, and the whole system flushes the pipes with air and water to clean itself out. The company says the whole process takes under 30 seconds. (The capsules do have something akin to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/5/7986327/keurigs-attempt-to-drm-its-coffee-cups-totally-backfired"&gt;Keurig-esque DRM&lt;/a&gt;, too: the machine scans a basic barcode to identify the capsule.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mn7hUI"&gt;Like with Keurig’s venture, Stanley Black &amp;amp; Decker (which also owns DeWalt, Craftsman and Porter-Cable) isn’t going it alone: it’s teamed up with Bartesian and uses that company’s existing pods (which cost $15 for a pack of six, each good for a single drink). Interestingly, the Bev comes in $50 less expensive than Bartesian’s current machine. Stanley Ventures &lt;a href="https://thespoon.tech/bartesian-raises-20m-series-a-for-its-countertop-cocktail-appliance/"&gt;also invested in Bartesian last year&lt;/a&gt;, and Black+Decker spokesperson Brooke Withers confirms that the company “is working with Bartesian to explore options for bringing the at-home craft cocktail experience to additional markets around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBEeIa"&gt;Newgadgets.de got a very quick look at the Bev on the CES 2022 show floor, and you can watch it embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OQzuOl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0W4Q3eM8Ls?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pdQWzF"&gt;In case you’re wondering, no, the Bev does not have a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi remote control, but the company says it does have a “party mode” with LEDs to light up the bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
