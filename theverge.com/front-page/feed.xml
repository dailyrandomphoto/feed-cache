    <title>How to choose between the Dell XPS 13 OLED and the Asus ZenBook 13 OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED open on a table. The screen displays a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elJIOGLrK6C8BYHyw28wW8zQ6OI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733253/mchin_20190905_4631_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nAvSBT"&gt;OLED has been commonplace in high-end TVs for quite a while, but it’s still making its way into the laptop mainstream. That’s good news for shoppers looking for a more vibrant multimedia experience. OLED panels have unbeatable contrast ratios, combining the blackest possible blacks with the whitest possible whites. They bring entertainment to a new level, and they can lend a hand with creative photo and video work, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h6laI"&gt;Not too long ago, OLED laptops were a luxury purchase. But smaller mainstream OLED devices are becoming more common each year. Whether you’re a die-hard OLED enthusiast or you’re just looking for a way to upgrade your movie-watching experience, you now have two excellent 13-inch OLED machines to choose from: the Dell XPS 13 and the Asus ZenBook 13. The question is — which one should you buy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIz6YK"&gt;The TL;DR is that the XPS is a more expensive and more niche purchase, while the ZenBook has more configuration options. The specs and prices should make that clear. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop/xn9310cto235h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell’s machine&lt;/a&gt; only comes with an Intel Core i7-1185G7 — there are no other processor options. You can pair that processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,549.99, and can upgrade that to 2TB of storage and 16GB of RAM for $1,999.99 or 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $2,269.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6WjK1"&gt;With the ZenBook 13 OLED, you can actually choose your processor. For the starting price of $799.99, you can get an &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202106AM030000001/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-OLED-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-AMD-Ryzen-5-5500U%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-PCIe-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Wi-Fi-5%2C-Windows-10-Home%2C-Pine-Grey%2C-UM325UA-DS51"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5500U, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000002/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i5-1135G7%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-256GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-DS51"&gt;Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can get &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000003/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i7-1165G7%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-ES71"&gt;a Core i7-1165G7&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM260000011/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-OLED-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-AMD-Ryzen-7-5700U%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-PCIe-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Wi-Fi-5%2C-Windows-10-Home%2C-Pine-Grey%2C-UM325UA-DS71"&gt;Ryzen 7 5700U&lt;/a&gt;, both with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, for $899.99. On top of that, there’s a model with a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM090000001/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-Intel-Core-i7-1165G7%2C-16GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Thunderbolt-4%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-AI-noise-cancellation%2C-UX325EA-XS74"&gt;Core i7-1165G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAskqe"&gt;So these laptops fill pretty different niches. The ZenBook offers affordable options for a variety of needs, while the XPS is a powerful computer for folks with deeper pockets. The main question to ask yourself is whether the extra benefits of the OLED XPS are worth that extra money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18W5ct"&gt;To help you answer that question, I’ve got a summary of each product’s selling points and drawbacks below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NiJyPZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Best laptop 2021: 15 best laptops you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED keyboard seen from above. The screen displays an LED numpad." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1dxILnkKa35DIClFdCx9TQJ-JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424430/mchin_20190626_4502_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenBook has a few neat benefits, including an LED numpad on the touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wYvpcU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ZenBook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D8fQbE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Processor options: &lt;/strong&gt;AMD Ryzen 5500U, Intel Core i5-1135G7, AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, Intel Core i7-1165G7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYKPGO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RAM options: &lt;/strong&gt;8GB, 16GB (only available with Core i7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SfK6DS"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Storage options: &lt;/strong&gt;256GB (only available with Core i5), 512GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2N1DMy"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dimensions and weight: &lt;/strong&gt;11.97 x 7.99 x 0.55 inches, 2.5lbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oq0WQZ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Battery size: &lt;/strong&gt;67Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DaDmPp"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Display resolution: &lt;/strong&gt;1920 x 1080&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jJPlN7"&gt;Don’t let the low price fool you — Asus’ ZenBook 13 OLED is one of the best 13-inch laptops you can buy. Its main selling point is battery life. The AMD configuration that I reviewed was a standout in this area, averaging over 11 hours in my testing. It’s also one of the lightest laptops in its category, weighing in at just over two and a half pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYdiaG"&gt;The ZenBook’s other primary benefit is its flexibility — you can pick your processor. The eight-core AMD model delivered excellent performance (in addition to its long-lasting battery), tearing through my daily workload and running lighter games at playable frame rates as well. Folks who might prefer the four-core Intel models are those who want to connect Thunderbolt 4 accessories (a standard not available on the AMD models) or who want to take advantage of Intel’s Quick Sync feature for video work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yD5ll"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An impressive package for its price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5kBu8K"&gt;That said, there are a couple compromises you’re making for this low price. If you put the ZenBook next to the XPS, it will be clear which one is more expensive — the ZenBook has a bit of a plasticky look and feel, with a fair amount of flex in the chassis and a floppy hinge. The lid is also quite a fingerprint magnet, which dampers the look of its otherwise-cool concentric swirl design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtSMw0"&gt;The other major differentiator is the screen resolution. While many OLED panels are 4K, the ZenBook actually has an FHD OLED display. It still looks good, but it won’t look quite as stunning as you’d see from a 4K OLED device (such as Gigabyte’s creator-focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22559671/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-price-specs-features"&gt;Aero 15 OLED&lt;/a&gt;). Oh, and there’s no headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewnotH"&gt;All in all, the ZenBook is still an impressive package for its price — but there are some potential dealbreakers. Here’s how I summed it up in my review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vfQbTi"&gt;There are some nice extra benefits (the LED numpad, the HDMI) and some drawbacks (the plastic look, the lack of headphone jack, the terrible webcam), but the screen and the processor are the stars of the show and the main considerations. While some of the drawbacks may be dealbreakers for some shoppers (they would be for me), many may see them as reasonable sacrifices in order to get this performance at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="MsgBSy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10704058"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED lid on a wooden table seen from the top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dURjdBErq8wET1b1gVuT4iDFsec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653798/mchin_20190905_4631_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a white or a dark model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ll3RxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9hMqe1"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Processor options: &lt;/strong&gt;Intel Core i7-1185G7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BPI6kN"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RAM options: &lt;/strong&gt;16GB, 32GB (only available with 1TB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5TOJea"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Storage options: &lt;/strong&gt;512GB, 1TB, 2TB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WSBKyK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dimensions and weight: &lt;/strong&gt;11.64 x 7.82 x 0.58, 2.8 lbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gb1fSb"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Battery size: &lt;/strong&gt;52Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQhcrb"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Display resolution: &lt;/strong&gt;3456 x 2160&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2aWcNI"&gt;The XPS 13 OLED is really a premium machine for customers who want the best of the best. The first thing to note is that this laptop has a 3.5K display, which delivers a truly gorgeous picture. If screen quality is important to you, you’ll probably notice a difference in the sharpness of this display over the ZenBook’s. (Though, again, the ZenBook’s still looks great and should be fine for many people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwVkts"&gt;The other big differentiator is the specs available. The XPS 13 has a Core i7-1185G7, which beat our ZenBook unit in our content creation tests. That’s what we’d hope to see, of course, given how much more expensive this laptop is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pqud8N"&gt;And, of course, Dell’s product offers some other benefits over the ZenBook. It has a 16:10 screen, which gives you a bit more vertical space. While it’s a bit heavier, it’s also significantly sturdier, and the build quality is noticeably nicer. The keyboard and touchpad are a bit better as well. It’s a small step up across the board — but the screen and the processor are the bulk of what that extra money gets you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2TOYQq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A very expensive computer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Pml9"&gt;That said, even if you’re willing to pay extra money for the XPS’s benefits, there’s one really important thing to consider: battery life. The combination of the high-resolution screen, the powerful processor, and the smaller battery gave the XPS 13 OLED some disappointing longevity issues in my testing. I was only getting about five hours from the device in my testing, which is less than half of the lifespan I got out of the ZenBook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10N2ub"&gt;So if price is no object, you still need to consider: is power or battery life more important to you? Given that the ZenBook’s options can do just fine with most of the tasks that most people need, my conclusion is that only people with pretty specific workflows who don’t need to move around that much are better off with the XPS. As I noted in my review, “If you’re someone for whom the OLED is worth the price, you probably know who you are.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile says unauthorized access to its data occurred, not clear if customer info involved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ZDJrsxmWZ2O8LyxKR5DDk--Q10=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733189/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T Mobile data breach | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31aRzY"&gt;Following a weekend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach"&gt;report that its servers had been breached&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile said Monday that unauthorized access to some of its data occurred, but it had not yet determined whether personal customer data was involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0dH6o"&gt;“We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,” the company said in a news release. “This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwtto3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that a post on an underground forum claimed to be selling data stolen from T-Mobile’s servers, and that the seller of the data said it included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver’s license information related to more than 100 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3VazM"&gt;T-Mobile said Monday that it was investigating the claims, “conducting an extensive analysis alongside digital forensic experts to understand the validity of these claims, and we are coordinating with law enforcement.” The statement added that T-Mobile would communicate with customers once the company had a clearer understanding of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvpltv"&gt;T-Mobile has been the target of several data breaches in the last few years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;most recently in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. During that incident, call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers may have been exposed, but the company said at the time that it did not include more sensitive info such as names or Social Security numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows users can now manage their iCloud Passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aH7ddqUMVde7u-tV2OpUm4KrLDQ=/0x0:860x573/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733156/2021_08_16_11_16_34_Settings.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nN9avk"&gt;If you sync your iCloud Passwords with Windows, Apple’s new, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;dedicated iCloud Passwords app&lt;/a&gt; is going to give you some much-needed new abilities. The app, which comes with the iCloud for Windows 12.5 update, lets you search through your saved passwords, update them, add new ones, and delete login info you no longer want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTE5xN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/manage-passwords-icwa812f1681/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;Apple’s documentation&lt;/a&gt; explains how to manage your iCloud Passwords using the new app, but it’s relatively straightforward. You can access the app from the Start menu, and make any changes to your passwords that you need. Those changes will then be synced to your Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-dwpODws0adrDZaDAVXCNNKrA-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786016/2021_08_16_11_18_47_iCloud_Passwords.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Passwords running on Windows 10 (note that all data included in screenshots is example data). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NIyX9i"&gt;Apple rolled out some support for iCloud Passwords on Windows earlier this year. In January, an iCloud for Windows update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22259720/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-browser-extension-released"&gt;added support for a Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; that would let you use the passwords already in your iCloud Keychain, as well as add new ones to your keychain from Chrome. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252825/apple-icloud-keychain-windows-google-chrome"&gt;That extension&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263118/apple-icloud-windows-password-sync-version-removed"&gt;a very rocky rollout&lt;/a&gt;, but it eventually became available to users in a somewhat working state. It’s still part of iCloud for Windows 12.5’s password management system, and the 12.5 update brings support for an Edge version of the extension as well (in theory, Chrome extensions work with Edge, but &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj?hl=en"&gt;reviews on the Chrome web store&lt;/a&gt; indicate that this wasn’t the case for iCloud Passwords). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cinlsh7quWa9LdhYGMmxPZseqW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785982/2021_08_16_11_20_37_Login_on_Twitter___Twitter.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chrome extension lets you use passwords saved in your iCloud Passwords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hfRvka"&gt;This update makes using iCloud to sync your passwords significantly more viable if you’re someone who jumps between Windows and Mac (or who uses Windows and an iPhone). Being able to see and search through a list of your saved passwords gives you more flexibility than the browser extension, and being able to manage your passwords means that you don’t have to jump to an Apple device if you want to make changes to your logins. While the new app isn’t as fully featured as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;dedicated password manager&lt;/a&gt; (or, indeed, as Keychain Access on Mac), it’s certainly better than the little-to-no management abilities Windows users had before for their iCloud Passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNDC1N"&gt;The 12.5 update for iCloud for Windows is available now, and you can get it by going to the Windows Store and searching for updates. If you don’t already &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud-windows/set-up-icloud-passwords-icw2babf5e03/1.0/icloud/1.0"&gt;have iCloud Password syncing set up on your Windows machine&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to enable it in iCloud Settings before you can use the password manager, but the process is relatively simple. Doing so requires an Apple account that uses two-factor authentication, along with an Apple device running iOS 14 / macOS 11 or later, which you’ll need to get the security code. You’ll also have to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up-dae28983-8242-bb2a-d3d1-87c9d265a5f0#ID0EBD=Windows_10"&gt;have Windows Hello set up&lt;/a&gt; — but don’t worry if your computer doesn’t have biometric authentication, because you can also use a PIN. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Vanguard announced, with more to be revealed in Warzone on August 19th</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDSFjJ"&gt;Activision has officially announced &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, the next title in the hugely popular series, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYeaKjAahjA"&gt;with a short teaser video on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While the video doesn’t reveal a lot — it consists mostly of footage of four different locales that each feature a mysterious face — it seems that the game will take place during World War II, likely on the four fronts of the war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hg05y"&gt;Details are light right now, but more will be revealed about &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; at an event inside &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, the series’ take on a free-to-play battle royale shooter, on August 19th at 1:30PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;

The new game arrives as Activision Blizzard is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;being sued by the state of California&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly fostering a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researcher says he found terrorist watchlist exposed online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DceOgKn5GTbC5ZOl2PmAc6zXXmw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733096/akrales_161208_1298_A_0060_play.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHPNZz"&gt;Nearly 2 million terrorist watchlist records, including “no-fly” list indicators, were purportedly exposed online. The list was indexed across multiple search engines on July 19th, but the Department of Homeland Security did not remove it until three weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/secret-terrorist-watchlist-with-2-million-records-exposed-online/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer &lt;/em&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttYGdl"&gt;Security Discovery researcher Volodymyr “Bob” Diachenko discovered the watchlist, which appears to be the product of the Terrorist Screening Center, last month. The files were indexed by multiple search engines in an easily readable format. Records included information like full names, citizenship status, date of birth, passport numbers, and no-fly indicators. No password or separate authentication was necessary to access it, Diachenko wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/americas-secret-terrorist-watchlist-exposed-web-report-diachenko/"&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lFeAy1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I immediately reported it to Department of Homeland Security officials”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dt4K2D"&gt;“I immediately reported it to Department of Homeland Security officials, who acknowledged the incident and thanked me for my work,” Diachenko wrote. “The DHS did not provide any further official comment, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jW4ZKj"&gt;The server was indexed by search engines like Censys and ZoomEye on July 19th. Diachenko discovered the data that day and reported it to the Department of Homeland Security. It wasn’t until August 9th that the server was taken down. It’s unclear if any unauthorized users accessed the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxzKvC"&gt;The Terrorist Screening Center is a multi-agency center led by the FBI and responsible for managing the US’s terrorist watchlist. It produces a watchlist used by screening agencies like the DHS and Transportation Security Authority (TSA) to identify known or suspected terrorists attempting to enter the country by boarding aircrafts or obtaining visas. Databases like these contain extremely sensitive information related to US national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEsjfk"&gt;It’s not unusual for&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25612748"&gt; innocent people&lt;/a&gt; to be put on the FBI’s no-fly list. In 2008, NBC reported that one US airline recorded 9,000 false positives in a single day. In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/kashem-et-al-v-barr-et-al-aclu-challenge-government-no-fly-list?redirect=national-security/latif-et-al-v-holder-et-al-aclu-challenge-government-no-fly-list"&gt;filed a legal challenge&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of 10 US citizens or permanent residents who were falsely added to the no-fly list. In 2014, a court ruled that the government must notify citizens and permanent residents when they are placed on the list. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Apple rejections, FlickType gives up on popular iPhone keyboard for the blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehPF9Mv6r-SkJs0p-Rf_L-oS06g=/0x84:2016x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733034/flicktype_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Upup9"&gt;If you’re a blind or low-vision iPhone user who relies on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-watch-keyboard/id1359485719"&gt;the FlickType keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to type, I’ve got some bad news — you’re about to become a casualty of the fight between Apple and one of its staunchest critics. Developer Kosta Eleftheriou has announced that he’s discontinuing the iPhone keyboard portion of his app, and says that keyboard will automatically be removed in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZuEIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52ZqXA"&gt;You might have heard the entire app is going away, and that’s not actually true, Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;In January 2020, he added a swipe-to-type Apple Watch keyboard to FlickType that saw the app skyrocket to the number one paid app in the entire Apple App Store for a time, and that app will continue to exist and continue to contain that Apple Watch keyboard.  Eleftheriou says the app has nearly half a million downloads, but he doesn’t have a breakdown for how many of those users rely on the iPhone keyboard specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screenshot says “please enable full access for FlickType under the iOS Settings app.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNV7oi5-nRWEhBwZwSWfE_mixVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786073/13_twS_I.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple provided Eleftheriou with this screenshot “proving” the app doesn’t work without access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXfm4m"&gt;If his name sounds familiar, that’s because Eleftheriou is the same developer who’s been poking holes in Apple’s App Store image for months, pointing out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how egregious scams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;secret gambling dens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;review fraud&lt;/a&gt; keep making it through the company’s filters even though they’re pretty easy for anyone to root out. His fight became personal long before today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he sued Apple in March&lt;/a&gt; for some seemingly shady behavior, alleging that Apple erected roadblocks to his FlickType keyboard in order to convince him to sell the technology to Apple for a discount, all while scammy mobile keyboard apps flourished on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfBxvV"&gt;Now, says Eleftheriou, Apple has suddenly decided to reject FlickType yet again — and for a reason that he’s already successfully argued with them in the past. He shared the rejection letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a pretty simple dispute: Apple says the keyboard needs to work even if a user doesn’t give it “full access” to network access and other iOS features. But Eleftheriou says that if Apple actually tried to use the app, or consulted their earlier discussions, they’d see that the keyboard works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N9YGH5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried reaching out to Apple a total of 9 times last week, with no success. At this point they seem to be ignoring our attempts to contact them directly, despite previously explicitly telling us to "feel free" to contact them if we need "further clarification".&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292841676398596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqyvCH"&gt;To be clear, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html"&gt;own developer guidelines specify&lt;/a&gt; that “full access” isn’t a problem: the only dispute here is whether the app continues to work if a user turns it off — which it does, says Eleftheriou, if you turn VoiceOver on. “They’d have to try it as a VoiceOver user, something that they don’t seem to bother doing. I’ve had several rejections in the past because the reviewer didn’t know anything about VoiceOver,” Eleftheriou says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KuUMt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292843928821765"&gt;As his Twitter thread explains&lt;/a&gt;, Eleftheriou sees this as the final straw for this specific feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEntkf"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nE4HhJ"&gt;Eleftheriou stops short of accusing Apple of retaliation, in a separate chat over Twitter DM. “I can only speculate about this rejection, but I’ve recently had many more rejections I haven’t talked about yet, and them ignoring my attempts to reach them is also new,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg4tQe"&gt;“I can’t really know, but definitely feels like some kind of ‘special’ treatment going on,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnhdju"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s decentralized social network project finally has a leader</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JF82CnR1GAYMnsKRU7c0TOsfuo=/186x0:1566x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732847/Screen_Shot_2021_08_16_at_12.06.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bluesky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a5TRaZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, the Twitter-funded effort &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;to create a decentralized social network standard&lt;/a&gt;, has finally found a project lead — the creator of Happening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea?s=20"&gt;Jay Graber&lt;/a&gt;. Bluesky and Graber have also begun hiring for the project’s first developers, meaning the slowly gestating project might finally become a bit less “blue sky” and a bit more real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNcqU7"&gt;Besides experience leading the work on &lt;a href="https://happening.net/"&gt;Happening’s event organizing features&lt;/a&gt;, Graber worked on &lt;a href="https://z.cash/"&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt;, a cryptocurrency created by the Electric Coin Company that uses zero-knowledge cryptography to secure transactions. Graber was also one of the authors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242718/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-media-team-project-update"&gt;a report Bluesky published in January&lt;/a&gt; detailing its research into decentralized web systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RDqoyR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m excited to announce that I’ll be leading &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative started by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to decentralize social media. Follow updates on Twitter and at &lt;a href="https://t.co/Sg4MxK1zwl"&gt;https://t.co/Sg4MxK1zwl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jay Graber (@arcalinea) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1427314482154414080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="izih4G"&gt;While the report didn’t explain how Bluesky itself would work, it did highlight some of the areas Graber and her team will have to address once the project brings on a &lt;a href="https://blueskyweb.org/Bluesky-Protocol-Developer.pdf"&gt;protocol developer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blueskyweb.org/Bluesky-Web-Developer.pdf"&gt;web developer&lt;/a&gt; full time, like standards for moderation, privacy, and monetization. What’s less clear is if Bluesky will build on existing decentralized projects like ActivityPub, the social networking standard used in Mastodon, or create something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9rVVyc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter wants to decentralize, but decentralized social network creators don’t trust it ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bfp8ln"&gt;If you’re invested in Bluesky’s ongoing work in the space, especially now that there’s a leader to kick things into gear, Graber also shared that the project has &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/YmrHBhCuFa"&gt;a dedicated Discord to follow along with development&lt;/a&gt; and discuss elements of the project as they’re announced. Hopefully that happens more frequently now that Graber’s in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="JEu6KZ"&gt;Tinder said on Monday that it will make its ID Verification feature available to all members around the world “in the coming quarters,” &lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The feature will allow users to verify their identities by uploading documentation; in Japan, where the feature has been live since 2019, a passport or license is typically used, but that may vary from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8BXXC"&gt;The company said it will take into consideration recommendations from experts and input from Tinder members about which documents would be used in each country as well as local regulations and laws while it rolls out the feature. Tinder says it will use the feedback to ensure the process is inclusive and “privacy-friendly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stDxvj"&gt;Rory Kozoll, head of trust and safety product at Tinder, said the company is taking a “test-and-learn” approach to the ID verification launch. “We know one of the most valuable things Tinder can do to make members feel safe is to give them more confidence that their matches are authentic and more control over who they interact with,” Kozoll said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PTELt"&gt;ID Verification will initially be voluntary except as required by local law, and Tinder acknowledges that some users may not want to share their identities online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkKODM"&gt;“We know that in many parts of the world and within traditionally marginalized communities, people might have compelling reasons that they can’t or don’t want to share their real-world identity with an online platform,” said Tracey Breeden, vice president of safety and social advocacy at Tinder parent company Match Group. “Creating a truly equitable solution for ID Verification is a challenging, but critical safety project and we are looking to our communities as well as experts to help inform our approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ymgw5P"&gt;Tinder has continued adding safety-focused features to its app; last year it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21077423/tinder-photo-verification-blue-checkmark-safety-center-launch-noonlight"&gt;photo verification system&lt;/a&gt; that adds a blue check mark to users’ dating profiles. And in March, Match Group announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22327854/match-group-garbo-tinder-background-check-update"&gt;investment in background check firm Garbo&lt;/a&gt; and said it would make the technology available to Tinder users, although it hasn’t done so yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton says a fix is ready for one of its treadmill recalls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UvGeXho1-x0DLhmkjzfef2g6TiY=/120x0:1080x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732608/PELOTON_TREAD.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YnZ0T"&gt;Peloton is ready to address at least one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;treadmill recalls&lt;/a&gt;. Regular Tread owners can now get their equipment fixed, which will involve a technician coming to users’ homes. They can schedule the visit starting this month. The company recalled both the Tread Plus, its more expensive first treadmill, and the Tread, its newer, cheaper device, in May after reports of multiple injuries and at least one death on the Tread Plus. There were 18 incidents of the regular Tread’s touchscreen falling and causing minor cuts and bruises in the UK and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk8dXO"&gt;Peloton and the Consumer Product Safety Commission haven’t said exactly what was wrong with the Tread — only that the touchscreen could loosen — or how it’s being fixed. Only 1,050 units of the Tread exist right now, so it’s not a massive recall, but still an undertaking for Peloton. The company was supposed to widely launch the device in the US in late May but hasn’t provided an updated timeline since the recall. It also hasn’t said when the Tread Plus might be fixed, of which there are 125,000 impacted units. On a call with investors in May, CEO John Foley &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423745/peloton-recall-timeline-tread-plus-john-foley"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Tread Plus “could take months” to return to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTgq8V"&gt;He also added that the company needed to be a “leader in safety in the industry” and that the repaired products would be “one of the safest if not the safest treadmills in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local and anonymous social media app Yik Yak is back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BQsWfGP4HEdBIJluaFa0viqaFo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732537/YikYakApp_2021_Aug_16.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="knVMtm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/"&gt;Yik Yak&lt;/a&gt; — the anonymous, local social media app that only shows posts from people in your immediate area — has &lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/the-yak-is-back"&gt;returned from the grave&lt;/a&gt; with new ownership after shutting down four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5ryfF"&gt;According to the app’s relaunched website, the new incarnation of Yik Yak bought the rights to redevelop the service in February 2021, with the aim of providing a local social media network that’s free from the “labels” that dominate communication on other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMk0hp"&gt;The new app resembles the original version of Yik Yak from 2014: users can post and comment on short text posts that are only able to be viewed within a five-mile radius. Like Reddit, posts can be upvoted and downvoted, and a separate “hot” feed compiles the top post from the past 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WFVnUx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  ICYMI: After a 4 year hiatus, Yik Yak is available in the App Store again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Anonymity, location-based, the hot feed &amp;amp; more — everything you used to love about Yik Yak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now available on iPhone in the US — more countries and devices coming soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV"&gt;https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HUAKh4elcA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HUAKh4elcA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yik Yak (@YikYakApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YikYakApp/status/1427310464585900035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H7OIAS"&gt;Originally launched in late 2013, the app was a flash-in-the-pan success (particularly at college campuses) for most of 2014, when it was valued at $400 million by investors. But while the anonymity made it popular for college students, Yik Yak also was rife with bullying and harassment. In early 2016, in an effort to get things back on track, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/8/11175886/yik-yak-handles-usernames"&gt;Yik Yak added optional social media handles&lt;/a&gt;, which were made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12492152/yik-yak-redesign-local-yakkers-status-updates"&gt;mandatory in August&lt;/a&gt; of that year, effectively removing what had made the service unique. The original incarnation of Yik Yak ended up shutting down in early 2017, when it was sold for $1 million to Square for its engineering talent and IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYUghr"&gt;The new Yik Yak looks to be taking a serious stance on bullying and harassment on its platform, though — something that the original incarnation of the app failed to do. The new owners have posted an extensive list of its “&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/community-guardrails"&gt;community guardrails&lt;/a&gt;,” which include prohibiting sharing of personal information, “anything that could be construed as bullying, abuse, defamation, harassment, stalking, or targeted hate or public humiliation,” and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvctrq"&gt;The company also notes that bullying, hate speech, threats, or other violations of any the community guardrails or terms of service can lead to an immediate ban from the platform. And posts that receive a total score of -5 will be hidden from view, too, to ensure that negative or harmful content isn’t surfaced further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub5lhG"&gt;The new Yik Yak is currently only available to download on iOS for users in the US, but the developers are promising to expand to more countries and devices soon. &lt;/p&gt;
