    <title>Virgin Galactic spaceplane VSS Unity completes successful flight</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;VSS Unity in space over New Mexico on May 22nd. | Virgin Galactic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbGNaU"&gt;Richard Branson’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Virgin Galactic completed its first successful space flight in more than two years on Saturday, with its crewed VSS Unity spacecraft carried to an altitude of more than 44,000 feet before gliding safely back to Earth. It marked the first spaceflight from New Mexico, making it the third US state to launch humans into space. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico"&gt;The Zia sun symbol&lt;/a&gt; of New Mexico’s state flag was displayed on the outside of the ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJfZWr"&gt;Virgin’s VMS Eve carrier aircraft took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico at about 10:35AM ET with Unity aboard. About 10 minutes before its release, Unity switched to its own battery power, and conducted flight control and electrical checks. Once released by Eve, Unity’s pilots C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay ignited the rocket motor, then shut it down a few minutes later, with the spacecraft’s momentum keeping it traveling toward its apogee, or highest point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyKm2o"&gt;Unity reached a speed of Mach 3 after it was released from Eve, and reached space at an altitude of 55.45 miles.  It reached apogee at about 11:30AM ET, did a slow turn, then glided back into Earth’s atmosphere, landing at about 11:43 AM ET on the same Spaceport America runway where its flight began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="me7nHP"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0MX6rI"&gt;“It was picture perfect,” Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a phone interview Saturday after Unity and Eve were back on the ground. “We’re gonna go through the data deeply and thoroughly as we always do.” In a statement, Colglazier called the flight a “major step forward for both Virgin Galactic and human spaceflight in New Mexico,” which had never hosted a crewed test mission to space until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9GkWA"&gt;“You’ve never seen a mix of more proud parent engineers,” Colglazier said of Virgin Galactic’s engineering team. Dozens of company employees gathered to watch the test flight under clear blue skies at Spaceport America, the company’s HQ for future commercial missions. Champagne was popped to celebrate the craft’s landing and Branson, the company’s billionaire founder, was “electrified” to see it all play out, Colglazier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oY3VoQ"&gt;Saturday’s flight, which also carried research payloads for NASA’s Flight Opportunities program, is the latest step toward Virgin Galactic’s goal of a space tourism program. The company has some 600 reservations for tickets on future space flights, which go for around $250,000 each. Unity is able to carry up to six passengers and two pilots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GRYU5"&gt;It was Virgin Galactic’s first space flight since 2019, and the third one it’s completed. Unity’s first two flights, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18138279/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceshiptwo-space-tourism"&gt;in late 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18232354/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-spaceplane-test-spaceflight-passenger-beth-moses"&gt;early 2019&lt;/a&gt;, were conducted at the company’s test facility at the Mojave Air and Spaceport out of California. Virgin Galactic later moved its operations to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Spaceport America&lt;/a&gt;, where it plans to conduct all of its commercial tourist flights. The company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22171114/virgin-galactic-vss-unity-powered-test-flight-abort-spaceport-america-new-mexico"&gt;abort its first flight attempt&lt;/a&gt; at the new facility in December, after Unity’s engine cut out early ahead of its glide back to Earth due to what the company later said was electromagnetic interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kagbfo"&gt;VSS Unity’s flight on Saturday featured some hardware upgrades installed since the December abort scenario, including a new digital controller that the pilots used for tighter handling. “This was our first run with it under full power, and it was flawless. Spot on,” Colglazier said. That controller will be used on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356889/virgin-galactic-unveils-new-spaceship-iii-three-3"&gt;SpaceShipThree&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s upgraded spacecraft tailored for routine production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxkVJf"&gt;Virgin Galactic said in February, and &lt;a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2021/q1/Virgin-Galactic_Q1-2021-Earnings-Slides_FINAL_5'10'21_12pm.pdf"&gt;confirmed during its May 10th earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, that it has a total of four spaceflights planned this year. The next one is slated to have two pilots and four Virgin Galactic employees as passengers, and a third flight is scheduled to have Virgin founder Richard Branson on board. Flight four is intended to be a commercial flight for the Italian Air Force, which should generate $2 million in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFYuwb"&gt;Saturday’s flight was the &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=97565"&gt;400th commercial space launch&lt;/a&gt; licensed by the FAA. The dates for the future Unity flights are still to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGpw3V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 22nd 2:17PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds details from Virgin Galactic about the flight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7DMeY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 22nd 5:51PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds interview with Virgin Galactic CEO and more details about Unity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aerion Supersonic, which planned to make silent, fast business jets, is shutting down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmLAxXdc8_DqCbWcXWkLlCJAdeo=/145x0:879x489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328868/aerion.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Flying off into the sunset | Aerion&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXjRAv"&gt;Aerion Supersonic, which had plans to build silent business jets that would travel twice as fast as most commercial airplanes, is shutting down operations. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/21/aerion-supersonic-abruptly-shuts-down-citing-challenges-securing-capital/5208809001/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Florida Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Aerion, which &lt;a href="https://aerionsupersonic.com/boeing-partners-with-aerion-to-accelerate-supersonic-travel/"&gt;had backing from Boeing&lt;/a&gt;, said it was unable to raise the money to build its AS2 supersonic jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0mbzN"&gt;“The AS2 supersonic business jet program meets all market, technical, regulatory and sustainability requirements and the market for a new supersonic segment of general aviation has been validated with $11.2 billion in sales backlog for the AS2,” the company said in an statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X641l0"&gt;“However, in the current financial environment, it has proven hugely challenging to close on the scheduled and necessary large new capital requirements to finalize the transition of the AS2 into production. Given these conditions the Aerion Corporation is now taking the appropriate steps in consideration of this ongoing financial environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbTUlH"&gt;Aerion CEO Tom Vice said in January 2020 that the AS2 would likely cost about $4 billion for the company to develop, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/aerions-as2-silent-supersonic-jet-aims-to-fly-by-2024.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, it had already spent $1 billion to develop the AS2’s engine. And in April 2020, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/c21ad6baefffca81adb4bd6dde4dcb1c"&gt;Aerion was relocating its headquarters&lt;/a&gt; from Reno, Nevada to Melbourne, Florida, at a plant to be built at Orlando Melbourne International Airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1uyCt"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-22/texas-billionaire-s-supersonic-jet-dream-dies-as-aerion-folds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Aerion was in talks to go public via a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Those talks apparently did not come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfQYlt"&gt;The company’s AS2 was intended to travel at around 1,000 miles per hour, and its patented “boomless cruise” technology would have allowed it to fly without creating a sonic boom. The company had planned to fly its first AS2 by 2024, and begin commercial flights by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJoQ64"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n0TLT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese startup Pony.ai gets approval to test driverless vehicles in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China’s Robocars Are Way Behind Their U.S. Counterparts" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkqv6s0MyG5t7rAmbH8ADcIbUds=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328730/1142319105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Chinese autonomous vehicle startup Pony.ai has&lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-authorizes-pony-ai-to-test-driverless-vehicles-in-fremont-milpitas-and-irvine/"&gt; received a permit from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to test its driverless cars without human safety drivers behind the wheel on specified streets in three cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzoveN"&gt;Pony has been authorized to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers in California since 2017, but the new permit will let it test six autonomous vehicles without safety drivers on specific streets in Fremont, Alameda County; Milpitas, Santa Clara County; and Irvine, Orange County. According to the DMV, the vehicles are designed to be driven on roads with speed limits of 45 miles per hour or less, in clear weather and light precipitation. The first testing will be in Fremont and Milpitas on weekdays between 10AM and 3PM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAlGzj"&gt;A total of &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/"&gt;55 companies have active permits &lt;/a&gt;to test driverless vehicles in California according to the DMV, but Pony is only the eighth company to receive a driverless testing permit, joining fellow Chinese companies AutoX, Baidu, and WeRide, along with US companies Cruise, Nuro, Waymo, and Zoox. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197980/nuro-licensed-autonomous-deliveries-california"&gt;Nuro is the only company&lt;/a&gt; so far to receive a deployment permit that allows it to operate its autonomous vehicles in California commercially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9n14d"&gt;Pony.ai, which is based in Guangzhou and Silicon Valley, was valued at $3 billion after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley"&gt;$400 million investment from Toyota&lt;/a&gt; last year. The company said earlier this month its robotaxis will be ready for customers in 2023. Pony claims it’s the first company to launch autonomous ride-hailing and provide self-driving car rides to the general public in China.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after future update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOtKaw-P1xfh2CUMir5x-DtzEic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328285/jbareham_180202_2266_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sD5nPS"&gt;In a new support document on its website, Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183"&gt;dives a little deeper into the details&lt;/a&gt; around the upcoming launch of lossless audio on Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxkEOt"&gt;Apple now says that both the HomePod and HomePod Mini will support lossless audio after a future software update. That’ll be good news to people who’ve invested in one or a pair of Apple’s smart speakers. Two HomePods grouped in stereo playing a lossless source? Yeah, that’s going to sound wonderful. Apple isn’t yet giving any timetable for when this software update will be released, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIusvP"&gt;The document also clarifies that the Apple TV 4K will only support standard lossless audio when the ALAC files become available in June. Apple has said that in most cases, the “Hi-Res Lossless” tier will require external devices like a USB DAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSkBY0"&gt;Apple uses the document to tout its “commitment” to providing customers with the best possible listening experience. It talks up both AAC — claiming that the format has become “virtually indistinguishable from the original studio recording” as encoding methods have evolved — and its Apple Digital Masters initiative. I continue to think that Apple is much more excited about spatial audio and Dolby Atmos mixes coming to Apple Music than anything to do with lossless itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8J91M"&gt;The document also reiterates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;what Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; in regards to the AirPods Max: when listening to audio via the Lightning-to-3.5mm cable, the company says it’ll sound fantastic, but it won’t technically be “lossless” due to an analog to digital conversion that occurs in the cable. Apple again confirms that lossless quality will be exclusive to Apple Music:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YM2kOC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I redownload my iTunes purchases in lossless?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gM7OrM"&gt;If you subscribe to Apple Music, you can redownload music in lossless only from the Apple Music catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vYKo36"&gt;The straightforward answer to the question as written is really a flat “no,” but obviously Apple wants to nudge people towards its subscription service. Apple Music will offer over 20 million songs in lossless quality at launch in June, and that total will reach over 75 million by the end of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook’s Fortnite trial testimony was unexpectedly revealing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlLa-l7Gi7acAzhS7HlzqN7CSsE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328196/1233030839.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkoY2d"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was bookended by Tims. Epic Games called its CEO Tim Sweeney as the first witness nearly three weeks ago. Yesterday, Apple called Tim Cook as the last to take the stand, before both sides make their final case to a judge on Monday. Cook was supposed to bring home Apple’s defense of its ecosystem. He did it by laying out Apple’s most high-minded principles — but also its hard financial calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGpgYJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; covers two separate issues: whether the market for in-app purchases within the App Store is unfairly monopolistic, and whether iOS &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a monopoly that should be opened up to third-party stores and side-loaded apps. Cook addressed both with an appeal to user safety and privacy. “Privacy from our point of view is one of the most important issues of the century, and safety and security are the foundation that privacy is built upon,” he explained to an Apple attorney, echoing countless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;iPhone ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. “Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data from people, and we like to provide people tools to circumvent that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VthQ1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Technology has the ability to vacuum up all kinds of data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qhsVpC"&gt;Supporting side-loaded apps would remake iOS, and it’s much easier for Cook and Apple to outline the potential downsides. Giving users control creates risk, and Cook argued that people choose iOS specifically so they won’t have to make risky decisions with sensitive data. “We’re trying to give the customer an integrated solution of hardware, software, and services,” he said. “I just don’t think you replicate that in a third party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNnDYU"&gt;Epic mustered its own arguments: people can still choose to keep their phones locked down, and they might want to access stores with even more carefully curated apps or even better privacy controls. It’s previously accused Apple of hypocrisy, pointing out anecdotal failures to catch specific apps (like a game called &lt;em&gt;Ganja Farmer: Weed Empire&lt;/em&gt;) that violate App Store guidelines. “It’s not 100 percent. It’s not perfect. You will find mistakes being made,” Cook said when Apple’s counsel asked about those incidents. “But if you back up and look at it in the scheme of things, with 1.8 million or so apps on the store, we do a really good job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3WXYt"&gt;Luckily for Apple, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers hasn’t demonstrated much interest in completely opening up iOS. She’s asked a steady trickle of questions about in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;anti-steering provisions&lt;/a&gt;, and the structure of individual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;apps like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but rarely about third-party app distribution or sideloading. (One of those rare incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;seemed critical&lt;/a&gt; of Epic, too.) While Rogers’ questions don’t necessarily indicate how she’ll rule, there’s a fairly conspicuous lack of requests for more detail or clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h78mEu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azAogS"&gt;But losing mandatory in-app purchase commissions would still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21369460/apple-fortnite-app-store-services-business-model-epic-games"&gt;be a big blow&lt;/a&gt; for Apple. Cook used more privacy and safety claims to defend that system, saying it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separately. He was also, however, a little blunter about Apple’s own interests. “IAP helps Apple efficiently collect a commission” — for payment processing, but also customer service and the use of Apple’s intellectual property. Without in-app purchases, “we would have to come up with another system to invoice developers, which I think would be a mess.” If Apple let developers tell users about other payment methods, Cook said later, “we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUlxWp"&gt;Apple called an expert yesterday to describe how its multibillion-dollar research and development costs help developers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/21/6746613/first-games-ios-8-metal-graphics-available-download"&gt;through APIs like Metal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15725994/apple-mobile-ai-chip-announced-wwdc-2017"&gt;CoreML&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not necessarily sinister for Apple to profit from these investments. But unlike better privacy and safety features, higher profit margins don’t directly improve consumer welfare, the key standard in antitrust trials. Judge Rogers ended Cook’s testimony with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;some of her most interesting questions yet&lt;/a&gt;, grilling Cook on whether in-app game purchases — like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; V-Bucks and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; gold — were effectively subsidizing the rest of the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cicn8i"&gt;Rogers doesn’t seem to personally &lt;em&gt;like &lt;/em&gt;video game microtransactions; she’s mused multiple times about potentially predatory impulse buys. But it matters that she singled out games. Epic has pushed to make this suit cover all App Store purchases, while Apple has been trying to limit it to digital video game sales. (That’s why witnesses spent so much time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;trying to define a game&lt;/a&gt;.) Cook’s interrogation suggested that even if iOS stays intact and “gamers” are the only audience in question, Apple still has battles left to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The League of Legends 2021 World Championship will be in Shenzhen, China</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RjUFa0"&gt;The 2021 &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship will be held in Shenzhen, China, &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2021-league-of-legends-worlds-final-date-venue-set/bltb734e254ca2378e3"&gt;Riot Games announced&lt;/a&gt; late Friday. The Worlds Final will be at the Universiade Sports Centre, a 60,000 capacity stadium that’s home to the Shenzhen FC football (soccer) club, on November 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMCgUS"&gt;“We’re extremely excited to push the boundaries of entertainment and sport this year with Worlds 2021 and define the next 10 years of LoL Esports,” John Needham, Global Head of Esports for Riot Games said in a statement. “Shenzhen is China’s most competitive and innovative city with thousands of high-tech startups and entrepreneurial pursuits, so we felt that it was the perfect landscape to host our Finals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HzcYtt"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVV0ek"&gt;The event usually rotates year-by-year among host countries in Asia, North America, and Europe, but 2021 is the second year in a row the event will be held in China. Last year’s finals were a scaled-back event; originally scheduled to take place across several cities in China, it ended up being confined to Shanghai, with players in in a quarantine bubble. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fesports%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F30227558%2Fdamwon-gaming-win-2020-league-legends-world-championship&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F22%2F22448865%2Fleague-of-legends-2021-world-championship-shenzhen-china-esports" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;South Korea’s DAMWON Gaming won&lt;/a&gt; the Summoner’s Cup in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfUe2P"&gt;Details about the early rounds of the tournament are still to come, Riot Games said in its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Home Sick Pilots is a haunted house story with a punk rock edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6t0OaZk0kPPMXHQ0WsSC8WqUBU=/0x387:585x777/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69328089/home_sick_pilots_vol_1_teenage_haunts_tp_74bfafdd45.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKeCle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nATKX"&gt;Haunted house stories are usually pretty dreary. It helps with the horror: a bleak old house covered in shadows so that you can’t see what’s around the corner. But &lt;em&gt;Home Sick Pilots&lt;/em&gt; goes in a different direction. It’s still dark and spooky, but it’s also incredibly vibrant — thanks in large part to its punk rock edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="500PJR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Sick Pilots&lt;/em&gt; is an ongoing series from Image Comics — the run is currently five issues deep — about a girl named Amida, her band, and a sentient house. It’s a period piece, set in 1994, and Ami is part of a group of high school-aged punk rockers looking to make a name for themselves. Then she comes up with a brilliant idea: “We should throw a gig in the house that kills people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6cWnn"&gt;Initially, the haunted house feels pretty familiar. It’s that big old place that everyone in the neighborhood whispers about, but no one really knows much about its actual history. It’s a literal broken home — and it takes a liking to Ami right away. The house gives her some supernatural powers — at one point, Ami describes herself as “just a little ghostly around the edges” — and tasks her with helping gather missing household items that contain the essence of different spirits. It’s like a very unsettling video game fetch quest. At the same time, the house isn’t so nice to everyone else, literally killing people and keeping Ami in the dark about it. At one point, while narrating the story, she asks, “Did you know that houses can lie?” The vibe is sort of like if Stephen King discovered Riot Grrrl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5uYce"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home Sick Pilots&lt;/em&gt; is dark and, at times, uncomfortable — there are grisly deaths, scenes of drug abuse, and worse — but it’s also a real page-turner, moving at a brisk pace that makes you want to push forward to uncover the next mystery or see if someone survived. It’s also beautiful to look at, with a striking color palette with lots of blues, pinks, and purples placed starkly against black backdrops, and panels that move the story in clever ways. One of my favorite scenes, very early on, gives you a dollhouse-like view of the house, as two groups move through it, unaware of each other. I also have to give a shout-out to the creepy and inventive monster designs, which would make Guillermo del Toro proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnO8sb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it by? &lt;/strong&gt;The series is written by Dan Watters, best-known for his work on DC’s &lt;em&gt;Lucifer, &lt;/em&gt;with art by Caspar Wijngaard, who’s worked on a whole bunch of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; comics in addition to co-creating the surreal hardboiled detective series &lt;em&gt;Limbo&lt;/em&gt; with Watters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjdeS8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it? &lt;/strong&gt;All of the issues to date are available digitally on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixology.com%2FHome-Sick-Pilots%2Fcomics-series%2F150307&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22447405%2Fhome-sick-pilots-review-image-comics" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Comixology&lt;/a&gt;, and Image just released &lt;a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/home-sick-pilots-vol-1-teenage-haunts-tp"&gt;a first volume collecting issues one through five&lt;/a&gt;.

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Tile Mate features excellent Bluetooth range and, unlike AirTags, Android compatibility. | Image: Tile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oJ9SrM"&gt;At &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we strive to bring you the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;best deals&lt;/a&gt; we can find — after all, not everyone has the time to comb through endless product listings and retailer pages. The past week has seen some good buys, including deals on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, but many of the week’s top deals will continue through the weekend. Right now, for instance, you can save $24 on the second-gen Apple Pencil and score Tile’s latest Bluetooth tracker at its lowest price in months. It’s the weekend, y’all. Have at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2dJHlC"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="H7aP0z"&gt;The Android-friendly Tile Mate is now $5 off across the board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eOwbDE"&gt;Lately, it feels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have stolen all the thunder when it comes to Bluetooth trackers. And while they might be a better fit for iOS users than the Tile Mate, they’re also more expensive and restricted to the Apple ecosystem. The Mate represents an alternative, one compatible with Android and currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W9BBCTB/?tag=thewire06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;ascsubtag=AwgAAAAAAAAAACcv&amp;amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $20 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftile-mate-2020-1-pack-white-gray%2F6370635.p%3FskuId%3D6370635%26ref%3D212%26loc%3D1%26extStoreId%3D1104%26ref%3D212%26loc%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtJ2FBhAuEiwAIKu19gHAU-FqUjBK1tHPYjGWR7gDwD1wZ2DtaK0UJKrgNaVYw1Y53_sL7hoCRssQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftile-mate-2020-1-pack%2F-%2FA-76500798%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000082958771%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252B0060H00000wWu38QAC-Tile_MayJunePromos_Search_FY21_Flight%26adgroup%3DPLA_Tile%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9061079%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtJ2FBhAuEiwAIKu19h97E13XvcXapqiJEgzaoawX2mu-tOPrkOnrWhbC983CEjcgFyZnchoCGJgQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Although Tile’s crowd-finding network isn’t as robust as Apple’s, the Mate still boasts excellent range, as well as a replaceable battery and weatherproof exterior. You can even use it to ping your lost phone in a pinch, a feature not found on Apple’s like-minded device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="oMLyWV"&gt;The Jabra Elite 85T are down to their lowest price in months&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg9pxL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Jabra Elite 85T&lt;/a&gt; are Jabra’s most impressive pair of earbuds yet, and arguably some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; you can get for the money. Their active noise cancelation is excellent, as is the semi-open design and comfort level they provide, and they’re outfitted with on-earbud controls and support for Qi wireless charging via the included case. Right now, the 85T are seeing a price drop across multiple retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741204690804124885" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR78C46/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?subId1=VergeWeekendTechDeals052121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJabra-Elite-85t-Titanium-Black-Wireless-Headset-Music-Headphones-Titanium-Black%2F209756784&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Walmar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJabra-Elite-85t-Titanium-Black-Wireless-Headset-Music-Headphones-Titanium-Black%2F209756784%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D4458%26%26adid%3D22222222227419913145%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D512414805764%26wl4%3Daud-1025747331496%3Apla-1215502651170%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D113836540%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D209756784%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtJ2FBhAuEiwAIKu19tJTTXU0qVnit7AJGaUHUu0Kim-Fv5UwQkKN2vl654_bVNtYXidvYBoCqv0QAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="T9ETUM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IaE7cI"&gt;Pick up the new iPad Pro? You can save $25 on the latest Apple Pencil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ68wC"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a powerhouse thanks to Apple’s M1 chip, but if you’re an illustrator or someone who can’t give up traditional writing, you’ll likely need a bit more precision than the tablet can offer. Luckily, the second-gen Apple Pencil is currently &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14066852?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-ipad-pro%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku3260273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Verizon for $104&lt;/a&gt;, a 20-percent discount and one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on Apple’s latest stylus. It’s compatible with both the 11- and 12-inch iPad Pro, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; and last-gen iPad Pro models, and offers low latency, excellent pressure sensitivity, and the ability to recharge while magnetically attached to the side of your device. It’s a step up from its Lightning-centric predecessor, and a welcome one at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aDCxld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="D4E9ip"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ydEY4j"&gt;Save more than 50 percent on Razer’s Power Up Bundle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dINQNY"&gt;PC gaming can get expensive... fast. Thankfully, if you’re looking to pick up a set of must-have peripherals to compliment your latest PC build, Walmart is still offering a sizeable discount on the Power Up Bundle from Razer. The &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1039828/9383?subId1=VergeWeekendTechDeals052121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRazer-Power-Up-Bundle-Cynosa-Lite-Viper-Kraken-X-Lite%2F163841868&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cost-cutting, $69 package&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect starter kit for games like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, and includes a Kraken X Lite headset, a Viper ambidextrous mouse, and a Cynosa Lite keyboard. We can’t guarantee it will land you that coveted victory royale in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but like our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best gaming mice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt;, it will make things a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Time, money, and the new vaccination push </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Vaccination Effort Aims To Vaccinate Migrant Workers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MfPXBp4QmIjP02MhTam0AC5rKk=/0x42:3000x2042/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327914/1319098831.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydFcBe"&gt;In the US, COVID-19 vaccines are free, but it turns out that money is still a big barrier to vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cQ39l"&gt;See, even though the vaccines don’t cost a thing, it still takes time to go and get a shot and potentially recover from any side effects. For working adults, that may mean taking time off work — and that isn’t something that everyone can afford to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="hbr6vl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmWA18"&gt;Black and Hispanic people are particularly concerned about the tradeoff between missing work and getting the vaccine, according to new &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/how-employer-actions-could-facilitate-equity-in-covid-19-vaccinations/"&gt;results from&lt;/a&gt; research published by the Kaiser Family Foundation this week. People in both demographics are more likely than their white counterparts to work lower-paying jobs, which may not offer as much paid leave for things like illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ggjBw"&gt;Those results provide a pretty clear way forward for pushing the vaccination rate up. If businesses want their employees to get vaccinated, they should pay them for it. Or states can require businesses to provide paid leave — like New York, which now guarantees &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-legislation-granting-employees-time-receive-covid-19-vaccination"&gt;employees up to four hours paid leave&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjdC5M"&gt;Employees, unsurprisingly, like this idea. Among unvaccinated employed adults, a decent percentage of people said they’d be more likely to get a vaccine if their employer offered a bonus or paid time off. Some also said they’d be more likely to get the vaccine if employers brought the vaccine to work. These methods would especially be effective among Hispanic employees, the researchers found.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7DCMB6fN5x2nIyI0I0uOJY7hnB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531620/paid_vaccine_leave.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z5EqaG"&gt;That’s a vitally important demographic for public health workers to reach. People who identify as Hispanic or Latino are three times more likely to be hospitalized compared to white, non-Hispanic people, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. They are more than twice as likely to die of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCtwvT"&gt;Now, some companies are &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/22444414/covid-19-vaccine-incentives-amazon-target-mcdonalds"&gt;already offering incentives&lt;/a&gt;, handing out vaccine bonuses, and bringing in mobile clinics for their employees. That’s great, and similar efforts, whether by private companies, community groups, or governments, could actually make a difference in getting people in the US vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrlIGA"&gt;The pace of vaccinations has slowed down, as most people who &lt;em&gt;really want &lt;/em&gt;a vaccine already have at least one dose. That leaves people who either really don’t want a vaccine, and the ones that are stuck in a “wait and see” limbo. Overall, the number of people who are in the “wait and see” category has shrunk since December, when the first vaccines started to be delivered in the US. It now stands at about 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjtOSBUpCvr0R29bdt6_okxG8hY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531673/vaccine.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3BaXHF"&gt;Reaching that 15 percent could help the US get a whole lot closer to its goal of having 70 percent of its population vaccinated by July 4th — an achievement that could ward off future surges of COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/20/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/"&gt;health experts say&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9GAor"&gt;That means &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/20/opinion/covid-19-vaccine-chatbot.html"&gt;reaching people where they are&lt;/a&gt; is now even more important, even if where they are right now is hard at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGQaMt"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIEqxy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS(A):&lt;/strong&gt; Just to re-emphasize this: the vaccines are free. If you have been charged for a vaccine, the government would &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/us-attorney-s-office-and-hhs-oig-advise-covid-19-vaccine-providers-not-charge"&gt;really like to know about it&lt;/a&gt;. If you are charged, you &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/you-got-billed-for-your-free-covid-vaccine-heres-how-to-get-paid-back/"&gt;should be able to get that money back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It appears now that this might be a new coronavirus that spent time in dogs. This virus is not classified as a human pathogen yet, but researchers are keeping an eye on this coronavirus, and others that might emerge around the world.

As we learn to live with the disease and vaccinations increase, our relationship to the virus will gradually change too. Here’s how. (Nicole Wetsman / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYEaSQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01359-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix-and-match COVID vaccines trigger potent immune response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t happen often, but some people have gotten two doses of different vaccines. Now, early results from a study shown that these mix-and-match cases can still produce a strong immune response. (Ewen Callaway / &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Transgender’ will be among more than 350 new tags Twitch is adding next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3ReoYEDkwbUQMsB-UQSeC7rg_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69327900/acastro_181026_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozLTd4"&gt;Starting next week, streaming platform Twitch will add more than 350 new community tags to its platform related to gender, sexual orientation, race, nationality, ability, and mental health, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/celebrate-yourself-and-your-community-with-350-new-tags/"&gt;new blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The list of tags will include transgender, Black, disabled, veteran, and Vtuber, Twitch said, and it will remove the “ally “ references from its LGBTQIA tag, in favor of a new standalone ally tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nniZUu"&gt;The platform thanked its trans community for pushing for a transgender tag, and admitted “the simple truth is we should have done this sooner.” &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/25/21176485/twitch-trans-streamers-discoverability-tags"&gt;Twitch reportedly had resisted adding a transgender tag&lt;/a&gt; over concerns about targeted harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSKl75"&gt;“When we launched tags in 2018, we did so to boost discovery, to help creators describe their content and to help viewers find streams they’re interested in,” the blog post states. “We intentionally designed that system for creators to be able to describe what they were streaming, not who they were or what they stood for. We have maintained this distinction since that time, and we were wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm7StH"&gt;Twitch had removed the ability to create custom, user-generated communities in 2018, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2018/09/26/introducing-tags-and-new-categories-new-ways-to-discover-streamers-on-twitch-33744ef7b04f/"&gt;when it introduced tags&lt;/a&gt;. But the tag system required choosing from a list of Twitch-provided categories which did not include a transgender category. This made discovery for transgender streamers and other groups not included in Twitch’s categories much more difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVrGqO"&gt;Its LGBTQIA tag was generally considered too broad, which Twitch now acknowledges: “It took us too long to embrace that there should have been hundreds of ways for creators to share who they are and issues they care about,” the blog post states. “The Twitch community is incredibly diverse and the tags available to creators should reflect and celebrate that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgyzZh"&gt;The platform says it worked with independent third-party organizations including GLAAD, The Trevor Project, AbleGamers, and SpecialEffect, as well as other experts “focused on the progress of underrepresented” groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvnUvj"&gt;Twitch added in its post that users found to be using the tags for harassment will be subject to its &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/"&gt;Hateful Conduct and Harassment&lt;/a&gt; policy, and could face suspension. The company will provide more information about tags and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/twitch"&gt;take questions on a live stream&lt;/a&gt; May 26th at 9:30AM PT. &lt;/p&gt;
