    <title>Apple is reportedly prototyping foldable iPhone screens</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4esEx0"&gt;Apple has started work on a foldable phone, and it’s begun prototyping foldable screens internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A final device is likely still years away, the report says, and Apple is working on just the display for now — not the rest of the phone it would attach to&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrPm9a"&gt;The initial prototypes sound similar to the foldable screens we’ve seen used by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and others. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple is looking at making foldable screens with a “mostly invisible hinge” that could unfold to around the size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The report says that several screen sizes are being discussed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9z7JXa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under-display Touch ID is reportedly still in testing for 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSC7fl"&gt;Apple hasn’t publicly indicated any interest in making a foldable phone, though the company rarely signals its interest before entering a new product category. Major competitors have a head start on foldable devices, with Samsung and Motorola already releasing multiple generations of folding phones. Samsung’s Galaxy Fold came out in April 2019 (albeit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;with some substantial issues&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q61LiJ"&gt;On a more immediate note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;has some updates on Apple products coming in 2021. This year’s iPhone is expected to have “minor upgrades,” but one more substantial improvement is still a possibility: an in-screen fingerprint sensor. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;already said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/apple-working-on-in-display-fingerprint-id-for-future-iphones"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was looking into the feature for as early as 2020, and it’d be an obvious addition in 2021 since the wide adoption of face masks has seriously hindered the ability to use Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPtBM"&gt;It’s not clear how likely in-display Touch ID is to ship in 2021 (Apple tends to have iPhone features locked well in advance of production), but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says Apple is “still testing” the tech for inclusion this year. On a worse note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also says that Apple has discussed removing the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging on “some” iPhone models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVN73K"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored Tile competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, are finally planned to launch this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports, and the iPad Pro could be refreshed with a Mini LED display. A thinner entry-level iPad is reportedly in the works as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision is an ode to sitcoms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3E66Y0hnhXvT6I9cOy_t75aSMA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675648/wvo0120_101_comp_v015_a_uhd_r709_e5c920dc.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YbJwF"&gt;When times are tough, the sitcom is a refuge. Like late-night talk shows, the multicamera sitcom is one of the oldest formats in television. It’s affordable and efficient for the people who produce it, and comforting and familiar to viewers. Problems are introduced and solved in 30 minutes or less, usually with the realization that they were never that big of a deal in the first place. Characters have signature tics and catchphrases we love them for; in time, they come to feel like our friends. The best of the bunch are syndicated long enough that we’re able to introduce them to our children. What a pleasant thing it is, to retreat into the uncomplicated pleasure of a sitcom — a half-hour white lie to tell ourselves whenever the real world feels like a little too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2glcWN"&gt;Perhaps this is why &lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;at least at the start, takes the form of a sitcom. The new series, which premiered its first two episodes on&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/976581/9358?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; today, is the first Marvel Cinematic Universe TV show made for Disney Plus. It’s also the first MCU project following 2019’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, arriving after a year without any new MCU installments. As a comeback, it’s an odd one: the first image you’re greeted with is two Avengers side characters inexplicably being reintroduced as a married couple in the theme song to a black-and-white ‘50s sitcom. They’re driving to their new home, she in a wedding dress, he in a dapper suit, delighted to start their idyllic life together. But something feels off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUvceS"&gt;The boldness of this play — and the way it is precisely the opposite of what we know Marvel movies to be — makes it a perfect return. It’ll be intriguing for super fans curious about what the point is and how it might connect to the larger franchise, and it will be intriguing to those who might feel a little burned out on superheroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrdHGy"&gt;Marvel projects are gilded genre lilies. They like to pay lip-service to one genre of entertainment — &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man &lt;/em&gt;has the cadence of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a heist movie, for example, and &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracy thriller — while they mostly serve as vehicles for generic action sequences. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, in at least its first two episodes, seems more sincere than that: the first episode plays its conceit of classic sitcom homage almost entirely straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qraiDm"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/976581/9358?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents it, Wanda Maximoff and Vision are a married couple who have just moved into a well-to-do suburb. They’re trying to fit in while also hiding the fact that he’s a robot of sorts and she’s got superpowers. In the premiere, this manifests in a very &lt;em&gt;Bewitched&lt;/em&gt;-esque plot where Vision invites his boss home for dinner without telling Wanda. (She saves the day by using her powers to create an impressive meal without anyone noticing.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icaONi"&gt;Quietly, however, things get stranger. The ads in the show seem a little off. In the second episode, there’s an unremarked-upon time jump; the iconography of the ‘50s gives way to the fashion of the ‘60s. There’s &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;no allusion to Maximoff and Vision’s career as Avengers or anything they’ve been up to in previous Marvel movies. (The show does not mention that Vision, as far as we know, is dead — killed by Thanos at the end of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; and not brought back to life for &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hEtHV"&gt;Slowly, the fantasy starts to crumble. The characters joke about how Wanda and Vision do not have an anniversary or favorite song; and then, more overtly, the show offers glimpses behind the curtain to suggest that Wanda and Vision are being watched or that things that do not belong in this &lt;em&gt;Pleasantville&lt;/em&gt;-like setting are somehow seeping in. The comics-literate will tell you that there is a good reason for all of the mannered strangeness. The Wanda Maximoff of the comics literature has been known to manipulate reality, and it would make sense that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; might be building to that kind of revelation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ18QF"&gt;But no matter how and when &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/976581/9358?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;decides to explain itself, the comics lore of it all is only as good or interesting as the story it’s embedded in. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; works well enough without too much knowledge of the decade of films preceding it. Fundamentally, you’re watching a superhuman couple that’s seemingly trapped in a sitcom. It makes even more sense, however, when you recall these characters shared a moment of severe trauma the last time they were together. It makes you wonder if maybe this is where they want to be. Sitcoms are a great place to hide when the world gets to be a little too much.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: CES 2021 and Samsung’s S21 lineup</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uEzgjO"&gt;This year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; was unsurprisingly all virtual. Typically, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is in the thick of it in Las Vegas, but this year, we’re all at our respective homes — so that means our podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9QLbR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Monica Chin, and Chris Welch dive into all of the important announcements from both inside and outside of CES — including Samsung’s new flagship S21 smartphone line, the many new TVs with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Mini LED&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;webOS&lt;/a&gt;, and the next laptops with new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;chips from Intel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple doesn’t make a MagSafe car charger — here are your options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2YypLOutr2SHxGrv2FW75FTcd5Y=/337x0:1537x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675287/belkin_wic002_magnetic_vent_cable_management_product_page_v01_r01_1680x600_us.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkfDkH"&gt;Getting a MagSafe car charger for your iPhone seems like a simple process, but the current landscape is one of trade-offs: there are no all-in-one solutions that will wirelessly hold and charge your phone &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are MagSafe certified to provide up to 15W of power. However, manufactures have been finding workarounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agS2QL"&gt;First, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-WIC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F15%2F22231718%2Fmagsafe-car-chargers-apple-iphone-certification-process#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin’s Car Vent Mount Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only MagSafe Certified car mount, and it sells for $39.99. Being certified doesn’t mean it provides power, though. You’ll have to plug your phone in with a Lightning cable (which you’d have to do anyway for wired CarPlay compatibility). This does technically let you charge your phone faster than regular wireless charging, but it leaves you messing around with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8tH9D"&gt;Then there’s &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/14/scosche-magsafe-magicmount-series-brings-magsafe-charging-to-your-car"&gt;the Scosche MagicMount&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a 20W car adapter but nothing to plug into it. You have to provide your own MagSafe puck, which adds $39 to the MagicMount’s $29.99 to $39.99 price tag (which varies by model). While it does technically get you MagSafe-certified mounting and charging, that’s only because you’re using Apple’s own puck. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1A3jkGPVnNX0cQqFQinjlAXv-6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238391/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_10.16.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re fine with just using an official MagSafe puck, you will be spoiled for choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CfxoE7"&gt;Just providing the plastic to put around Apple’s charger is a common approach. Amazon is full of the BYOP (bring your own puck) car mounts, and we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3300477/elago-w3-macintosh-apple-watch-charging-stand-sale-on-amazon.html"&gt;also seen it with Apple Watch charger accessories&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a quick and easy way to get users the fully certified experience without having to wait for certification (and without Apple’s Made For iPhone program fees). The downside is that users have to buy two different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh2PCV"&gt;Finally, there’s &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/26/review-esr-halolock-is-everything-a-magsafe-car-charger-should-be"&gt;the ESR HaloLock&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have it all. It’s one piece, magnetically holds your iPhone, and provides wireless charging. The only thing missing is MagSafe certification, meaning Apple will only let your phone charge at 7.5W. You’ll again see a lot of similar products on Amazon, where the manufacturer has copied MagSafe’s magnets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215639/anker-magsafe-qi-charger-apple-alternative-giant-usb-c-plug-explained"&gt;used a standard Qi charger for power&lt;/a&gt;. Like the puck holders, you’ll get most of the functionality without actually having to be certified, and the product will be fine for people who aren’t worried about fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cV4d0"&gt;This isn’t to say that third-party, fully certified MagSafe car mounts won’t show up at some point, just that it may take a little while. And given the other routes get you pretty close to the real deal, you can expect to see a lot of those in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7YyJJx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Peak Design takes on MagSafe with its own compatible magnetic mounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>WarnerMedia extends its 20 percent discount on HBO Max subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vaxg3vCzbZGKNaPQgOXHkOpl2cw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674938/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVLkDb"&gt;A discount on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21272223/hbo-max-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; that was supposed to end today, January 15th, has been extended until March 1st, 2021. The fine print of the offer hasn’t changed: you can get six months of HBO Max for 20 percent off the normal total cost, which is usually $90 before tax. &lt;a href="https://www.hbomax.com/"&gt;You’ll pay $70 with this deal&lt;/a&gt; (it’s like paying just under $12 per month instead of $15), but the catch is that you have to prepay in full and it’s nonrefundable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOq3Hq"&gt;This discount is open to both new and returning HBO Max subscribers, but it can’t be stacked with a free trial or any other promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhmXqS"&gt;WarnerMedia kicked off this deal in early December 2020 on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros. announcing that its 2021 slate of films would debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; alongside the theatrical releases and remain available to stream for 30 days. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; was the first of its films to launch, and you have a few more weeks to catch that one before it’s a theater-exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWTeW3"&gt;It has several more movies expected to launch throughout the year, including &lt;em&gt;The Little Things, Judas and the Black Messiah, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Those Who Wish Me Dead, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, In The Heights, Space Jam: A New Legacy, The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Reminiscence, Malignant, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, The Many Saints of Newark, King Richard, Cry Macho, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is again extending TV Plus trials to July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/me2uysfcLPyuog6TRPxQGfc2-eM=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674914/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oOgrkB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-again-extends-apple-tv-free-trials-subscribers-now-get-free-access-until-july-2021/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple will be extending its free year-long trials of its TV Plus service to customers until July 2021. The trials were originally included with the purchase of any Apple device (e.g., an iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;, with the first extending from November 2020 to February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWCt0Q"&gt;Subscribers who had free subscriptions that were set to expire any time from February 2021 to June 2021 will also get an extension until July. The extension comes in the wake of production delays. Only one of the shows the service launched with (&lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;) has had its second season premiere, while others — like &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;See&lt;/em&gt; — are still waiting for their second seasons to come out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zB2ZgV"&gt;Show productions being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic is no surprise, and extending the trial is a nice gesture. Viewers probably would like to start watching the second seasons of their favorite shows before they decide whether the service is worth $4.99 a month, and the extension is giving them the ability to do so. After all, there’s not a ton of use in a TV subscription service if some shows only have 12 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp to delay new privacy policy amid mass confusion about Facebook data sharing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H4Ou6zEiXz4l_m0CuKUCG1iVlvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674807/akrales_180215_2310_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ItYbS"&gt;WhatsApp on Friday announced a three-month delay of a new privacy policy originally slated to go into effect on February 8th following widespread confusion over whether the new policy would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"&gt;mandate data sharing with Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2zqvq"&gt;The update does not in fact affect data sharing with Facebook with regard to user chats or other profile information; WhatsApp has repeatedly clarified that its update addresses business chats in the event a user converses with a company’s customer service platform through WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nfZOsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WhatsApp is trying to clear up confusion about its privacy practices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q26Fj9"&gt;“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update"&gt;new blog post published today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kxcse"&gt;Since 2016, WhatsApp has shared certain information with Facebook, including your phone number, unless you were one of the select few users who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/26/12655518/how-to-stop-whatsapp-sharing-phone-number-facebook"&gt;chose to opt out of data sharing while the option was still available that year&lt;/a&gt;. WhatsApp does not, however, look at people’s chat messages or listen to their phone calls, and WhatsApp conversations are end-to-end encrypted to protect against those abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3iqi"&gt;Despite this, a pop-up informing users of the new change included mention of how WhatsApp partners with Facebook, and it also included an ultimatum instructing users to delete their account if they chose not to agree to the new terms. That gave people the idea they were being railroaded into new, more invasive terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9falaM"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;released a separate blog post this week&lt;/a&gt; trying to clear up the confusion, and it included a chart that specifies what information is protected and not shared when someone uses WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Gos4A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6qDnzQ98MP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1348839600333049857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dQXH4t"&gt;But numerous media reports highlighting the addition of new, broad language in the privacy policy (language WhatsApp says has been misconstrued to imply mandated data sharing) and misinformation on social media have coalesced into a full-blown WhatsApp privacy backlash. The result has been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in sign-ups for messaging competitors&lt;/a&gt; like Signal and Telegram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWvOnh"&gt;Facebook executives, including Instagram chief Adam Mosseri and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart, used Twitter to try to clear up the confusion, it seems with little success. Facebook’s poor privacy track record, and the fact that WhatsApp has over time turned its sights on monetizing the platform for its large international user base, has eroded trust in the chat app, which, in turn, has had the effect of turning a relatively mundane update into a worldwide controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1ezUd"&gt;WhatsApp says it’s now going to use this three-month delay to better communicate both the changes in its new policy and its long-standing privacy practices around personal chats, location sharing, and other sensitive data. “We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RfvTGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jbl556"&gt;WhatsApp says no one will be losing access to the app if they didn’t agree to the new terms of service agreement that communicated the changes earlier this month. “We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbF9Ht"&gt;WhatsApp tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the policy won’t be changing when it does come out. The intent of the update is communicating to users that messages with businesses on WhatsApp may be stored on Facebook servers, which necessitates data sharing between the two companies (that data, WhatsApp says, can be used for businesses for the purpose of advertising, but Facebook does not share it across its apps automatically). WhatsApp still intends to release the update on May 15th to coincide with new business chat features it &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;began previewing back in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjSmTD"&gt;But the company hopes the extra time will help it get a handle on the controversy and better improve its messaging around what’s actually changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Zz9V6"&gt;“The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services,” the blog post reads. “This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzodJm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 3:26PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified how WhatsApp’s new privacy policy will treat data collected during chats with businesses as part of the upcoming privacy policy change, now going into effect on May 15th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will address Pixel 4A 5G touchscreen woes in February update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WA4VgG46-A0OT6SNdczAkoyuvQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665252/akrales_201013_4137_0289.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUco78"&gt;Google says it’s aware of a problem with Pixel 4A 5G touchscreens and will address the issue in its February security update. Some devices are failing to respond consistently to taps on the lower part of the screen, which is particularly impacting folks who have opted for three-button navigation rather than swipes. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/pixel-4a-5g-touchscreen-issue-can-make-navigation-buttons-hard-to-use/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; spotted complaints&lt;/a&gt; from 4A 5G owners experiencing the issue, which seems to have cropped up after the December security patch was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHuU"&gt;Google’s response comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87628791?hl=en"&gt;a Pixel support forum post&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently updated with the February patch timing. In the meantime, Google advises users to work around the issue with some specific instructions on tapping navigation controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TqJzoJ"&gt;1. When tapping icons on the edge of the screen, tap the center of the button or the side of the button/icon furthest away from the edge of the display.&lt;br&gt;2. When tapping icons, including the navigation buttons on the bottom of your screen, use the tip of your finger or thumb instead. This will help improve touch recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SjP3BP"&gt;It’s not an easy task to try and consciously change the way you do something like tap a button on your phone screen, so hopefully Pixel 4A 5G users will only have to attempt these awkward workarounds for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qGgly1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 4A 5G review: more than just a bigger budget phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zwGZTa"&gt;Google’s January patch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22214270/google-pixel-january-update-5-system-sounds-loud-issue"&gt;did address a raft of other Pixel 4A 5G bugs&lt;/a&gt; and quirks with the security update. So while the touchscreen issue persists, at least an audio bug that was causing crackling sounds in some situations is no longer a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ1aSB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Google has now confirmed that its February security update will include a fix for the touchscreen issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly planning big iMac redesign and half-sized Mac Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 27-inch iMac" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4NLbopL1lUnciLfhthZSqzZUmWg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674516/DSC01539.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlSMVl"&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;revamped MacBook Pros that ditch the Touch Bar and resurrect MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is also said to be planning to announce its long-awaited iMac redesign this year — and a pair of Mac Pro refreshes are on the roadmap, too. This is all according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, who says the iMac will undergo its most significant overhaul since 2012: Apple will reportedly ditch the chin beneath the screen, cut down on display bezels, and move to a flat-back design. The overall appearance will likely resemble the Pro Display XDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rT5Uv7"&gt;The new iMac will replace the Intel-powered 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions currently available and move the all-in-one desktop to Apple silicon. It’ll be one of the most significant visual makeovers of any Apple product this year, according to the report. The existing iMac packs top-tier specs and a beautiful screen into a design that has felt particularly outdated these last couple of years, so this change will be welcome. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;The last revision&lt;/a&gt; focused on increased speed, an improved webcam, and also added an option for a matte / nano-texture display coating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hFnZ6"&gt;As for the Mac Pro, Apple seems to have a two-prong plan: it’ll refresh the current upgradeable tower design — Gurman says the company is considering sticking with Intel processors for this machine. But that doesn’t mean Apple is stalling on a Mac Pro that runs on its own chips. The company is also apparently at work on a completely new form factor that Gurman says is less than half the total size of the current Mac Pro. “The design will feature a mostly aluminum exterior and could invoke nostalgia for the Power Mac G4 Cube,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqzZRq"&gt;All of these will feature the next generation of Apple’s own Mac processors, which first debuted in last year’s M1 MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini. Last, Apple is reportedly planning to release a new external monitor that gives up some of the professional-grade display specifications of the Pro Display XDR to reach a wider audience of customers. The Pro Display XDR starts at $5,000, and Apple currently sells third-party monitors from LG as a  more affordable step-down option. But it sounds like a spiritual successor to the Thunderbolt Display could be on the way in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
