    <title>IMDb TV app finally arrives on iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YWBqDDedP4ZmG3dxwZYKciScfbY=/0x157:947x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685791/iOS_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: IMDb TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jKRoK9"&gt;Amazon’s free streaming service IMDb TV now has its own dedicated app for the iPhone, iPad, and Android after launching on other major platforms earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43jTsV"&gt;IMDb TV is a dedicated hub for free, ad-supported movies and series as well as its own dedicated originals produced by Amazon Studios. Previously, you could find IMDb TV’s content slate in the primary IMDb app, but a standalone streaming app for the service was not available for iOS and Android. A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the content is still available to stream through IMDb, but the new IMDb TV app was “designed for the streaming experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4C2Opp"&gt;IMDb TV’s content slate is quite good, even if its originals have struggled to make as much of a splash as titles from larger premium services. But if you don’t mind ads, there’s a ton of great stuff to stream for free on the service, including documentaries, sci-fi titles, dramas, and plenty of TV to binge. &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Schitt’s Creek&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt; are all currently streamable on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxmqnT"&gt;Plus, through a recently announced deal with Universal, IMDb TV will also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570590/universal-films-prime-video-streaming-peacock"&gt;exclusively stream&lt;/a&gt; some live-action and animated titles from the studio following their release in theaters and a brief pay-one premiere on Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEuOWw"&gt;The app was previously made available on the majority of major streaming devices and some smart TVs, including Fire TV, Roku, Xbox, Android TV, Android TV OS devices, newer LG Smart TVs, PlayStation 4, Chromecast with Google TV, and Nvidia Shield. It’s also available as a free channel within the Prime Video experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates admits meetings with Jeffrey Epstein were a ‘huge mistake’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUjpdVkDVvP5qKKqSF1zHsReAS4=/486x0:2880x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685441/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_1.08.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jAXJno"&gt;Bill Gates said that spending time with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was “a huge mistake” in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhZa3J2cemM"&gt;an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper&lt;/a&gt;. The interview covered Gates’ relationship with Epstein, which he says was an attempt to get “billions for philanthropy,” as well as Gates’ &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html"&gt;alleged workplace misbehavior&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVdca"&gt;Gates’ story regarding his relationship with Epstein hasn’t changed much since their meetings came to light. In 2019, he &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mind-of-bill-gates-revealed-on-netflix-11568107801"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he had met Epstein, but “didn’t have any business relationship or friendship with him.” A month later, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson for Gates, who said that Gates “regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognizes it was an error in judgment to do so.” The statement, and further comments from the spokesperson in the article, mention the same promises of charitable donations from Epstein that Gates talks about in his CNN interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vtuDOR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhZa3J2cemM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zAAS7U"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; story, however, reports that the two men met many times, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/12/20911488/bill-gates-foundation-jeffrey-epstein-meetings"&gt;details meetings that reportedly happened&lt;/a&gt; between Gates Foundation employees and Epstein that were centered on fundraising. In the CNN interview, Gates admits that the “several” meetings he had with Epstein (which took place after Epstein had &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2008/06/30/jeffrey-epstein-pleads-guilty-to-prostitution-charges/"&gt;pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor&lt;/a&gt;) gave Epstein credibility, which he again called a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOA5Yd"&gt;When asked if he had any regrets about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/16/22439640/bill-gates-microsoft-board-alleged-affair-investigation"&gt;an affair with a Microsoft employee&lt;/a&gt;, which was investigated by the Microsoft board, Gates said that everyone has regrets but that he needed to “go forward” with his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF5A3v"&gt;Melinda French Gates, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607200/bill-gates-melinda-french-gates-divorce-finalized-financial-assets-foundation"&gt;divorce from Bill Gates was recently finalized&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly objected to him meeting Epstein. Melinda and Bill will continue to work together to run their charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566889/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-divorce-governance-plan-two-years"&gt;foundation has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Melinda could leave after two years if she and Bill can no longer work together.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla reportedly paid $1 million to former employee who said supervisors called him a racist slur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlw8DUhO1fJHgS1ZhOIsYqBcMrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685384/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Giyg4Q"&gt;A former Tesla employee won a $1 million award from the automaker after an arbitrator found the company failed to prevent his supervisors from calling him a racial slur, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/ex-tesla-employee-called-racial-slur-wins-rare-1-million-award"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Law&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Melvin Berry, who is Black, was hired at Tesla’s plant in Alameda, California in 2015. He said a supervisor called him the N-word, then retaliated by forcing him to work longer hours and do more physically demanding work when Berry confronted him. Tesla has denied the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QGgpN"&gt;Arbitrator Elaine Rushing said in a May 12th ruling that Tesla was liable for the harassment Berry described, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Case law is clear that one instance of a supervisor directing the N-word at a subordinate is sufficient to constitute severe harassment,”  Rushing wrote. And, she wrote, a supervisor who wrote Berry a warning letter lacked credibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjKlHX"&gt;Tesla argued that there was no written evidence that Berry had complained about supervisors calling him the N-word, noting that he left the company voluntarily, the arbitrator’s ruling shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcDdOK"&gt;Arbitration proceedings between employers and employees are usually kept confidential, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomber&lt;/em&gt;g reported that Berry’s attorney filed a standard petition in court to enforce the arbitrator’s order, which revealed the decision. Attorney Lawrence Organ told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that Berry would not be pursuing further legal action since Tesla has paid the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho3AAz"&gt;Berry is not the first worker to allege racism at Tesla’s Fremont plant. In 2017, former assembly worker &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-racism-lawsuit-20171115-story.html"&gt;Marcus Vaughn sued Tesla&lt;/a&gt; saying the company had not investigated his written complaint that co-workers and supervisors had called him the N-word. Vaughn called the Fremont plant a “hotbed for racist behavior.” &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/hotbed-misinformation"&gt;Tesla said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; at the time that Vaughn’s lawsuit was a “hotbed of misinformation.” In April, a judge in Alameda County rejected the company’s request to block Vaughn from seeking class action status for the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxKOri"&gt;An email to Tesla seeking comment was not immediately answered on Thursday; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-media/tesla-disbands-u-s-media-relations-team-electrek-idUSKBN26R2CX"&gt;Tesla dissolved&lt;/a&gt; its press office last year and doesn’t usually respond to media inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xv8jxg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic reopens ticket sales starting at $450K per seat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B8AlutVRtxfHirPluRlV5bL1UMM=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685358/1233922307.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vrylcH"&gt;Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic is reopening ticket sales for its SpaceShipTwo spaceplane, the space tourism firm announced Thursday in its second-quarter earnings release. The starting price: $450,000, an expected increase from the roughly $200,000 price point the company had years ago, before it closed sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZuEpC"&gt;The ticket reopening comes on the heels of Branson’s successful flight in July to the edge of space aboard SpaceShipTwo, Virgin Galactic’s flagship space tourism vehicle that can carry four passengers some 53 miles high for a few minutes of weightlessness. That mission, called Unity 22, was a key milestone test of the rocket-plane before Virgin starts flying individual customers in late 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f1CgnE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ticket reopening is “effective today, beginning with our Spacefarer community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="820mUX"&gt;“Leveraging the surge in consumer interest following the Unity 22 flight, we are excited to announce the reopening of sales effective today, beginning with our Spacefarer community,” Virgin Galactic’s chief executive Michael Colglazier said in a release. “As we endeavor to bring the wonder of space to a broad global population, we are delighted to open the door to an entirely new industry and consumer experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs4daf"&gt;Ticket sales for individual customers had been closed since a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7139527/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-suffers-anomaly-in-flight"&gt;fatal 2014 accident&lt;/a&gt; during a test flight. After that accident, Branson vowed to ride SpaceShipTwo to space himself in a show of confidence of the vehicle’s safety before it starts flying paying customers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;After his successful mission on July 11th&lt;/a&gt;, with three company employees, the company is targeting late September for its first revenue-generating mission, it said in the press release. That mission, Unity 23, will carry research payloads and three members from the Italian Air Force.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6MkwX"&gt;Missions like the Italian Air Force’s, either for seat-sized microgravity research payloads or professional astronaut training, will cost $600,000 per seat, Colglazier said during an earnings call on Thursday. Prospective customers looking to pay at least $450,000 for a seat will have to get in an already long line — the company has said it has a backlog of some 600 ticket holders who will have to fly first. And a mass of roughly 1,000 prospective customers who’ve placed $1,000 deposits would be next in line, a spokesperson said. With the new ticket sales, Virgin will offer three ways to hitch rides on SpaceShipTwo: the single seat option, a “multi-seat couples / friends / family package,” and a full-flight buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VirMCx"&gt;“Sales will initially open to the Company’s significant list of early hand-raisers, prioritizing the Spacefarer Community, who, as promised, will be given first opportunity to reserve their place in space,” the company said. “A follow-on priority list will be opened to customers interested in reserving future spaceflights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8O5Uo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 5th, 7:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds information from Virgin Galactic’s earnings call and presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter Spaces adds co-host option to help moderate and manage rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x9uhxQryTqKJsFjeq-nkLLA3ygw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685280/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0setuD"&gt;Twitter is updating Spaces to allow hosts to designate up to two co-hosts for its social audio rooms, making it easier for hosts of the audio space to help manage and moderate conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPFJYU"&gt;Once invited, co-hosts have almost all the same moderation and managing privileges as the main host: they can speak, invite other members of the room to speak, pin tweets, boot people from the room, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNcz6-sZ6nYhowVSilBqbw2RNCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764381/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_3.42.05_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7pxy5WaCKZahGvcmRijivoirWCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764380/Screen_Shot_2021_08_05_at_3.42.41_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RLqIA1"&gt;There are a few limitations, though: only the main host can invite or remove other users as co-hosts — one co-host can’t invite a second one, for example. Co-hosts also can’t end the room; only the original host can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGLPXv"&gt;The co-host feature also expands the number of participants that can talk at once in a Space: now you can have one host, two co-hosts, and ten speakers all active in a room at once, up from the previous ten-speaker limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OLR0XO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;making it easier to manage your Space…introducing co-hosting!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- hosts have two co-host invites they can send&lt;br&gt;- the table just got bigger: 1 host, 2 co-hosts, and 10 speakers&lt;br&gt;- co-hosts can help invite speakers, manage requests, remove participants, pin Tweets and more! &lt;a href="https://t.co/s76JFbhTL2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s76JFbhTL2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1423333566675628039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAkUvr"&gt;The new addition is rolling out now and should be a useful part in helping hosts keep Spaces under control, especially for larger conversations. The fast-paced rollout also shows how important Twitter views Spaces to be: the company also recently dedicated the top area of users’ timelines in the app (where Fleets used to live) to the social audio feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reveals new efforts to fight child abuse imagery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gok31hxdir1iv9lGvMHre9icNaQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685176/acastro_180130_1777_0005_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ijVtvE"&gt;In a briefing on Thursday afternoon, Apple confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;previously reported plans&lt;/a&gt; to deploy new technology within iOS, macOS, watchOS, and iMessage that will detect potential child abuse imagery, but clarified crucial details from the ongoing project. For devices in the US, new versions of iOS and iPadOS rolling out this fall have “new applications of cryptography to help limit the spread of CSAM [child sexual abuse material] online, while designing for user privacy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVAAte"&gt;The project is also detailed in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;a new “Child Safety” page on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The most invasive and potentially controversial implementation is the system that performs on-device scanning before an image is backed up in iCloud. From the description, scanning does not occur until a file is getting backed up to iCloud, and Apple only receives data about a match if the cryptographic vouchers (uploaded to iCloud along with the image) for a particular account meet a threshold of matching known CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s7c9Mt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple described several restrictions that are included to protect privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MWQ3zI"&gt;For years, Apple has used hash systems to scan for child abuse imagery sent over email, in line with similar systems at Gmail and other cloud email providers. The program announced today will apply the same scans to user images stored in iCloud Photos, even if the images are never sent to another user or otherwise shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVFdM5"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; provided along with the briefing, Apple justified its moves for image scanning by describing several restrictions that are included to protect privacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SWQhU3"&gt;Apple does not learn anything about images that do not match the known CSAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnepX8"&gt;database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyjJWd"&gt;Apple can’t access metadata or visual derivatives for matched CSAM images until a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFPm9k"&gt;threshold of matches is exceeded for an iCloud Photos account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hlnFE"&gt;The risk of the system incorrectly flagging an account is extremely low. In addition,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWYbmK"&gt;Apple manually reviews all reports made to NCMEC to ensure reporting accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7XIpC"&gt;Users can’t access or view the database of known CSAM images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNtzsj"&gt;Users can’t identify which images were flagged as CSAM by the system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xsxTtI"&gt;The new details build on concerns leaked earlier this week, but also add a number of safeguards that should guard against the privacy risks of such a system. In particular, the threshold system ensures that lone errors will not generate alerts, allowing apple to target an error rate of one false alert per trillion users per year. The hashing system is also limited to material flagged by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and images uploaded to iCloud Photos. Once an alert is generated, it is reviewed by Apple and NCMEC before alerting law enforcement, providing an additional safeguard against the system being used to detect non-CSAM content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5RQd2"&gt;Apple commissioned technical assessments of the system from three independent cryptographers (&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_Benny_Pinkas.pdf"&gt;PDFs 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_David_Forsyth.pdf"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_Mihir_Bellare.pdf"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), who found it to be mathematically robust. “In my judgement this system will likely significantly increase the likelihood that people who own or traffic in such pictures (harmful users) are found; this should help protect children,” said professor David Forsyth, chair of computer science at University of Illinois, in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_David_Forsyth.pdf"&gt;one of the assessments&lt;/a&gt;. “The accuracy of the matching system, combined with the threshold, makes it very unlikely that pictures that are not known CSAM pictures will be revealed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNvsmU"&gt;However, Apple said other child safety groups were likely to be added as hash sources as the program expands, and the company did not commit to making the list of partners publicly available going forward. That is likely to heighten anxieties about how the system might be exploited by the Chinese government, which has long sought greater access to iPhone user data within the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVILkJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample Messages warning for children and parents when sexually explicit photos are detected" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YMgiqX4ORjTh6vSUvHOAFrLTHr8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764418/child_safety__evd7tla79kqe_large.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample Messages warning for children and parents when sexually explicit photos are detected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="erd5tl"&gt;Alongside the new measures in iCloud Photos, Apple added two additional systems to protect young iPhone owners at risk of child abuse. The Messages app already did on-device scanning of image attachments for children’s accounts to detect content that’s potentially sexually explicit. Once detected, the content is blurred and a warning appears. A new setting that parents can enable on their family iCloud accounts will trigger a message telling the child that if they view (incoming) or send (outgoing) the detected image, their parents will get a message about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obkAvI"&gt;Apple is also updating how Siri and the Search app respond to queries about child abuse imagery. Under the new system, the apps “will explain to users that interest in this topic is harmful and problematic, and provide resources from partners to get help with this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram scammers figured out a way to get paid for banning people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e2MnHWMIInM1YAQHJy8l5SoSQg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684779/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a24fCm"&gt;Instagram scammers have developed a lucrative “banning” racket, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k78kmv/instagram-ban-restore-service-scam"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For around $60, some scammers will get banned whatever Instagram account you choose, friend or foe, and often the scammers make even more money on the backend by helping the targeted users regain access to their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4g5PZ"&gt;The process, according to interviews and material reviewed by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, involves using a verified account to impersonate a target (their name, photo, bio), and then reporting the target as an impersonator to get them banned. Apparently, as long as the target has a human in their profile picture the method works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3nMwEN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Banning and restoring accounts pays well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3OyrQP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;writes that other users they spoke to also had their accounts banned for being reported for violating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2965449/instagram-self-harm-policy"&gt;Instagram’s policies around suicide and self-harm&lt;/a&gt;, a type of content the company has tried to become even more &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/more-steps-to-keep-instagram-users-safe"&gt;proactive around addressing in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. These bans could have been caused by any variety of scripts that can spam Instagram’s reporting tools without hitting the app’s limits (around 40 reports, apparently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZP838"&gt;The businesses of banning people is very lucrative according to at least one of the people &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;spoke to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5K1drb"&gt;War, the pseudonymous user offering the ban service, told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; in a Telegram message that banning “is pretty much a full time job lol.” They claimed to have made over five-figures from selling Instagram bans in under a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="suIMAQ"&gt;The fact that many of the businesses offering banning services also offered help getting accounts back, sometimes for anywhere between $3,500 to $4,000, probably doesn’t hurt either. Some users noted that they received offers of account help immediately after their accounts were disabled, and that often the Instagram account that reported them was following the Instagram account that offered help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGKm6r"&gt;Instagram did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the company told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that it was investigating sites that offered banning services, and that users should report people they suspect are guilty of that kind of activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UszCvH"&gt;If you believe your account has been disabled or banned, Instagram &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/366993040048856"&gt;offers instructions in its Help Center&lt;/a&gt; on how to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xhr6Lh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Halo Band can share your heart rate to other apps and workout equipment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The three color options for the Halo Band" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jVhZC2kmMbQJIDQZelQksbd6zQg=/138x0:2363x1483/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684745/Halo_Band_Hero_Colors.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="90QH7r"&gt;Amazon is updating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;its Halo fitness band&lt;/a&gt; today with the ability to share live heart rate information with third-party devices and fitness apps over BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The company is currently partnered with NordicTrack for its iFit service, along with Openfit and CLMBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkrEwl"&gt;Live heart rate has been available to view since launch in the Live tab of the Halo app, but connecting it to display in other apps and devices is just as easy. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G49AV98U5TBYACVG"&gt;Amazon says&lt;/a&gt; you can turn on heart rate sharing by going to the Halo app’s Settings, selecting Heart Rate Sharing, switching it to on, and then following the on-screen prompts to share your heart rate with the other app or device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qt3jgoFH8Goa-inQVhZzT4FIU_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764039/Openfit.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo live heart rate data overlaid in the Openfit app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jMSTAO"&gt;Showing on-screen heart rate is a fairly common feature for fitness services to motivate you while exercising and help explain why you might feel strained during a specific part of your workout. In some cases, on-screen heart rate is a feature that also sells other devices, like how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; requires the use of an Apple Watch for features like its “Burn Bar.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szwfLC"&gt;The Halo Band already working with a few more services is a real plus if you don’t want to be locked into a specific service. Flipping the switch on live heart rate monitoring is also just the latest way Amazon has supported its device post-launch with software features. In June, Amazon added the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465737/amazon-halo-fitness-phone-camera-measure-movement-health"&gt;for its app and band to monitor “movement health.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available online now at Walmart (Update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bjEjtNoRj9yx23VZM0T4lLefmw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684582/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qc82Bf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 5th, 4:07 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The Xbox Series X is no longer in stock at Walmart and the rolling restocks appear to have concluded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPoHXb"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F141335186&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; is available online for delivery through Walmart. It’s also offering both the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 disc-based console&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F493824815&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;digital version&lt;/a&gt;. The pricier and more powerful Series X that has a disc drive and 1TB of storage has been almost as tough to find as the PlayStation 5, so this restock is very welcome news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DBLF8t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4G7DpQ"&gt;If this is your first time jumping into the ring, there are a few bits of advice that might lead to success for you. Don’t leave the site if the console appears to sell out immediately. Walmart usually releases stock in 10-minute intervals, with the next being at 3:50PM, 4PM, and so forth until it runs out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wdz7DM"&gt;I recommend ensuring that you sign in to your Walmart account ahead of time to make sure that your shipping and payment settings are just the way you want them. Lastly, be patient, as sometimes the “add to cart” button will pop up after it appears to be sold out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5ubig"&gt;We’ll update this post if more retailers offer the new Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CUs33L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sTMezi"&gt;One of the great things about getting an Xbox console is you’ll be able to access a trove of games with the affordable Game Pass Ultimate subscription. If you aren’t sure which games to get, I suggest signing up for a month to start, which should be around $1 if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bH0R88"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vg27ec"&gt;Other things to consider are accessories. Online retailer Antonline is currently offering a bundle containing the Xbox Wireless Headset and an official Microsoft wireless controller for $140. Purchasing them separately would usually cost you $165. There’s a bundle with the headset paired with &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431921"&gt;a pulse red controller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431922"&gt;a shock blue controller&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431825"&gt;one with an electric volt controller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Wceql"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683559"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPjHF6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCcQRM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4G7DpQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 5th, 4:07PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart is sold out of PS5 consoles for the moment. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpWwfJ"&gt;If you haven’t been able to secure a PlayStation 5, you might be in luck. Walmart has opened orders for the PS5 (online only); this includes the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 disc-based version&lt;/a&gt; of the console as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F979738052" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 digital disc-less version&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, it’s usually the first who gets the worm, but not always. If you miss out on the first wave at Walmart, the retailer usually releases more in 10-minute intervals, with the next being at 3:10PM, 3:20PM, and so forth until it runs out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T2BM0q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Wdz7DM"&gt;Also, if you don’t get lucky at first, persist! Sometimes, the “add to cart” button will pop up intermittently, so just be patient and watch closely. It’ll only help your chances of securing a console if you sign in to your Walmart account and ensure that all of your shipping and payment details are set so you can fly through checkout if you get a PS5 in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI5wAx"&gt;We’ll add more retailers to this post if any join in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9FpTcg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WMKy7m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArYNbs"&gt;If all you wanted was the console, well, you’re all set with the links above. But there are several games and accessories you could add to your cart right now that’ll let you have more fun with your PS5 when it arrives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t2rSE8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
