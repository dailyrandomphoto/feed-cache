    <title>Jack Dorsey’s hot Web3 takes are apparently too much for Marc Andreessen to handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At Bitcoin 2021 Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8eCPsprxsYm8nfTv1Nnh1aqs_fE=/0x0:5631x3754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70307707/1233275199.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WuZCzB"&gt;Who knew that leaving the top spot at Twitter could make someone a more interesting follow? The co-founder and (for the second time) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;former CEO of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; Jack Dorsey recently opened up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848162/jack-dorsey-web3-criticism-a16z-ownership-venture-capital-twitter"&gt;about his issues with so-called “Web3” projects that aren’t decentralized to his liking&lt;/a&gt; and the venture capitalists that he says own the whole thing, creating “ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdY8bo"&gt;Shockingly, his statements haven’t been received well by fellow tech thought leaders, billionaires, and venture capitalists, who’ve taken turns either trying to minimize his criticism of their blockchain efforts or going directly at him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TyyV0b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m officially banned from web3 &lt;a href="https://t.co/RrEIAuqE6f"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RrEIAuqE6f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jack⚡️ (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473725424387694601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KaA9W8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/6708/marc-andreessen-twitter-faves-alt-right"&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt; decided to take the step of blocking @jack, and Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473725424387694601?s=21"&gt;responded by saying he’s been “banned from Web3.”&lt;/a&gt; That’s not an unfair statement either, as the former Netscape co-founder and co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is now a huge investor in Web3 startups, tossing money around on DeFi projects, metaverse sneakers, tokens, and anything else that catches his eye. According to its “Web3 reading list” (&lt;a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-web3-Readlng-List.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) document from October, “a16z is the largest investor in this space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8s5pb"&gt;As researcher Jane Manchun Wong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1473725700645478415"&gt;points out,&lt;/a&gt; several other big tech exec names have exhibited either blocks or force unfollows of Dorsey as well, so Andreessen is hardly alone in this. However, Dorsey’s rants about Web3 included direct swipes at Andreessen Horowitz partner Chris Dixon and an exchange with Elon Musk — who has his skeptical opinions about the space — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473165759224463360"&gt;accusing the entirety of Web3&lt;/a&gt; of existing “between a and z.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pTUPik"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Elon Musk: metaverse isn’t ‘compelling’ and Web3 ‘more marketing than reality’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22849717/elon-musk-metaverse-web3-more-marketing-than-reality"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0LcmkT"&gt;Andreessen’s use of the block button, however, suggests that the next stage in this tiff will take place somewhere we (or at least you — he blocked me years ago) won’t see it — either behind closed doors or in one of the rooms he promotes on Clubhouse. You remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697557/clubhouse-creators-hot-pod-newsletter-free-edition"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; — it’s the not-so-trendy-anymore audio platform that grew rapidly last year and enjoys financial backing from a16z. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwO0pE"&gt;It’s a bit surprising that it took this long to see visible friction between Dorsey and Andreessen since Twitter’s Spaces feature had something to do with dimming the appeal of Clubhouse. Andreessen’s recent tweet encouraging people to come hang out on Clubhouse with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791989/citadel-ceo-ken-griffin-won-constitutiondao-sothebys-auction"&gt;the hedge fund billionaire who beat out ConstitutionDAO for a copy of the historic document&lt;/a&gt; garnered 19 retweets and 92 likes, while Dorsey’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473446029840297992"&gt;last tweet about Spaces&lt;/a&gt; highlighted an event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822078/twitter-spaces-recorded-ios-android-web"&gt;you can listen to&lt;/a&gt; with Alicia Keys and Jay-Z. It got 190 retweets and over one thousand likes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 starts to fall apart as T-Mobile, Amazon, AT&amp;T and others bail on in-person conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;Another year, another gigantic tech tradeshow that looks like it may be falling apart as the COVID-19 pandemic continues — now that T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;has publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; that his company won’t be attending the world’s largest electronics show next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon has also decided not to attend the show in-person, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to Axios’ Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. Intel also appears to be reconsidering as of Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CIAE17"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;T-Mobile, Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio have all announced this week that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But T-Mobile is the first major attendee to bail, with companies like Twitter and even Meta having a far more muted presence at the show in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BhyCbS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, did not have a large presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgCexR"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung and GM, which have featured keynotes like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic and Sony. Intel typically rents a lot of prominent space as well, but this year their huge booth appears to be MIA, replaced by Canon, Razer, and other smaller companies. “We are currently revisiting our plans for CES and will provide an update as soon as possible,” an Intel rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend as of Tuesday, and LG said Tuesday that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that AMD and Samsung are still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus and HTC still plan to attend. Sony, Samsung and Google are all listed as “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On Tuesday morning, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;As of Wednesday, the CTA says it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations, but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZhLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:09 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Amazon and LG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P8sia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information about AT&amp;amp;T, Intel, and a statement from the CTA, which organizes CES each year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TD3gWm"&gt;The other day, I was watching the documentary &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, which flashes on the screen the names of the songs being played and happened to miss the identification of a song I didn’t recognize. “What was that?” I asked my partner. He didn’t know either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDkm6q"&gt;But my Pixel 6 didn’t miss it. Looking down at my lock screen, it said “Dig a Pony The Beatles,” courtesy of Android’s Now Playing feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWpvO"&gt;Now, I’m not a huge music fan — I’m the kind of person who listens to the same album again and again, and when I hear a great new song, instead of immediately researching the source, I tend to think, “Hey, that’s nice,” and leave it at that. But now, when I hear something that I sort of like and later on suddenly remember it, I can look it up on my Now Playing list. Or if I’m watching a movie and think, “Okay, I’ve heard that song before,” I can turn to my phone and immediately find out the song’s name and artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuPlEs"&gt;And Now Playing works offline as well (which I tested by putting my phone into Airplane mode and then playing a song I hadn’t listened to before). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HprtnH"&gt;If this is a feature that appeals to you, and you happen to have a Pixel 2 or later phone, here’s how you set up Now Playing and what you can do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="roW3UH"&gt;Activate Now Playing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vWF6lm"&gt;Go to Settings by swiping down twice from the top and tapping the cog icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tSM4uu"&gt;Tap on “Sound &amp;amp; vibration” &amp;gt; “Now Playing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CyI6Nt"&gt;Toggle on “Identify songs playing nearby”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a2mjBI"&gt;Now the name and the artist of songs playing nearby will appear on your lock screen (note that since Now Playing works via a database on your phone, it may take a few minutes to download before it actually works)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Settings, go to Sound &amp;amp;amp; vibration &amp;amp;gt; Now Playing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZur1VPEyCYb4yC7n4_mW-sYhHU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120094/Screenshot_20211222_101214.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Settings, go to Sound &amp;amp; vibration &amp;gt; Now Playing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle on “Identify songs playing nearby”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGT9IGR8a9JHO7I570kQgfskLhE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120093/Screenshot_20211222_101247.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle on “Identify songs playing nearby”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pvSSZH"&gt;Activate the search button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MPXXqg"&gt;As mentioned before, the way that Now Playing works is it draws on a device-based database of music — which is why it can work offline. However, some of us enjoy more obscure music, which may not be part of the several thousand songs in that database. In that case, there is now a cloud search that can add your own preferred songs to the database via a search button on your lock screen. (Unfortunately, this feature is only available if you have a Pixel 4 or later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc6U1c"&gt;To enable that feature, go to your Now Playing screen and toggle on “Show search button on lock screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Now Playing button (below the fingerprint) lets you manually search for a song." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kmo_yuTT6Ma5EqkJ0qZ10KPGWV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120249/Screenshot_20211222_103934.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Now Playing button (below the fingerprint) lets you manually search for a song.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once the song is identified, it appears in the place of the icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6w2N5e_0Kt983oB9zas7rkZVOeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120250/Screenshot_20211222_104038.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once the song is identified, it appears in the place of the icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HfbAer"&gt;Manage your notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="puFjWu"&gt;When your Pixel identifies a song, it won’t only put it on your lock screen but will make it available via your notifications. You can manage both of these and more by going to the Now Playing screen and tapping on Notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select Now Playing &amp;amp;gt; Notifications to manage those notifications." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qxxocYktE8Yh_YTSiHSSEqCqILo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120313/Screenshot_20211222_112059.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select Now Playing &amp;gt; Notifications to manage those notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you want, you can shut them all off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/216eFpY_FnONPECqn9bPrIH3Zv8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120312/Screenshot_20211222_112041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want, you can shut them all off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kf3bsL"&gt;Find your Now Playing history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vsIGBi"&gt;What may be as useful, or even more so, as seeing what song is currently playing is to access the history of the music that’s been around you. You can access this by following the same choices as you did to activate the feature (“Settings” &amp;gt; “Sound &amp;amp; vibration” &amp;gt; “Now Playing”) and selecting “Now Playing History.” Once there, you can tap on a song to play it on your favorite service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your Now Playing history can let you know what you’ve listened to in the past." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vz6uT3E_y_-uLxF2URLh_S6Y9zU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120372/Screenshot_20211222_112323.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Now Playing history can let you know what you’ve listened to in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on one to hear it on your music service." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_XFWKBAWUWvpNTrgXEIG0KAkww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120375/Screenshot_20211222_113914.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on a song title to hear it on your music service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EmwIYZ"&gt;Make it easier to find your history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Mpwgp5"&gt;And yes, it’s a pain in the butt to have to go through all those steps to access your Now Playing history. If you find you are checking your history often, it’s probably a good idea to put a direct link to it on your home screen so you can just tap and look. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tH7rdn"&gt;When you’re in “Now Playing history,” tap the three dots on the top right corner and select “Add to Home Screen”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yeupmM"&gt;The Pixel Launcher will pop up at the bottom of your screen with a Now Playing icon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LauTKN"&gt;You can tap on “Add to Home screen” and then move the widget to where you want it, or press and hold the icon and move it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can add a Now Playing widget to your home screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gs191qu2ShRPpVnNM7wy7EhiUug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120422/Screenshot_20211222_112415.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add a Now Playing widget to your home screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can easily access Now Playing any time." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzBDGgAYFU4wlF9ohaPmws5GKAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120426/Screenshot_20211222_112818.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can easily access Now Playing any time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QFcxIH"&gt;What if you don’t have a PIxel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d3ejvq"&gt;Currently, the Now Playing feature is only available on the Google Pixel 2 and later. However, there may be a few workarounds out there if you’re feeling experimental. &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has found one: &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-now-playing-feature-ported/"&gt;an Ambient Music Mod&lt;/a&gt;, which it says has been confirmed to work on some OnePlus devices and may work on other Android phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7bHkR"&gt;And, of course, there are also apps that will help you identify songs. For example, the well-known song identification app &lt;a href="https://www.shazam.com/home"&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896350/apple-shazam-app-acquisition-complete-free"&gt;bought by Apple in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, is available for both iOS and Android. It doesn’t work offline, and you have to tap on the icon to start the identification process, but it’s a great alternative for those without current Pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zombie brand RadioShack is launching a crypto market for ‘the older generation’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="radioshack (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E5MWA0eakyHFcAMXK531h4xw4Ys=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70307595/DSC_5446.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eJAOxw"&gt;RadioShack, the venerable retailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/19/21578231/radioshack-rev-relaunch-online-store-zombie-brand"&gt;relaunched as an online-focused brand&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, now wants to chart a future as a cryptocurrency exchange. Earlier this week, the company announced RadioShack DeFi (short for “decentralized finance”), a market where people can swap newly announced RADIO tokens as an alternative to a centralized exchange like Coinbase. Moreover, RadioShack insists that it’s uniquely positioned to take cryptocurrency mainstream — &lt;a href="https://docs.radioshack.com/radioshack-defi/fundamentals/why-radioshack-defi"&gt;claiming that&lt;/a&gt; “RadioShack, and RadioShack alone, can bridge the gap and ‘cross the chasm’ of mainstream usage for cryptocurrency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQYApT"&gt;RadioShack’s argument is basically that as a very old brand, it’s primed to sell old CEOs on cryptocurrency. “Too many [cryptocurrency companies] focused on speculation and not enough on making the ‘old-school’ customer feel comfortable,” the company’s website states, claiming that the average “decision-making” corporate CEO is 68 years old. “The older generation simply doesn’t trust the new-fangled ideas of the Bitcoin youth,” particularly not “adults who are especially authoritarian, intelligent, and well-read (i.e., the CEOs that RadioShack seeks to woo).” Its parent company, Retail Ecommerce Ventures, also owns a variety of other brands like Pier 1 Imports and Dressbarn, and RadioShack speculates about the possibility of a brand like Pier 1 launching its own token through RadioShack’s system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ncSKDO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Pier 1 coin could follow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VeXTjx"&gt;If you want to read about RadioShack’s strategy, there’s a &lt;a href="https://docs.radioshack.com/radioshack-defi/fundamentals/why-radioshack-defi"&gt;series of pages&lt;/a&gt; explaining the system, which is built on a protocol called Atlas USV. &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/88712/yes-radioshack-pivoted-defi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decrypt&lt;/em&gt; also delves more&lt;/a&gt; into the parties behind the move. RadioShack is known as a consumer brand, but here, the broad goal is to become a platform that other companies (RadioShack cites Louis Vuitton, Starbucks, and Mercedes-Benz) use to run their own distributed finance projects. You can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radioshack.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F22%2F22849943%2Fradioshack-defi-cryptocurrency-radio-token-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;join a waitlist&lt;/a&gt; to be notified when the RADIO token launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66ycRq"&gt;The launch follows a pattern of troubled but well-known brands moving into cryptocurrency. In 2018 camera company Kodak &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16869998/kodak-kodakcoin-blockchain-platform-ethereum-ledger-stock-price"&gt;announced KodakCoin&lt;/a&gt;, which was supposed to be part of a blockchain-powered rights management platform for photographers. (This is distinct from the unauthorized Kodak cryptocurrency mining machine &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44845291"&gt;shown that same year.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/technology/kodak-blockchain-bitcoin.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; raised questions&lt;/a&gt; about the coin and its related platform, and Kodak appears to have &lt;a href="https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2020/07/30/kodak-resurrects-failure-cryptocurrency/"&gt;quietly wound it down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NshmSf"&gt;RadioShack has a somewhat clearer plan for its project. Its site is notably short on reasons why the average current or former RadioShack customer should want to use cryptocurrency. But for now, the goal is apparently to get &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; companies on board by trading on a well-known name. Or, as RadioShack puts it, “the brand is resolutely embedded in the global consciousness — ripe to be pivoted to lead the way for blockchain tech to mainstream adoption by other large brands.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop will have PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X bundles in-store on December 23rd</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqBoPc"&gt;Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839972/gamestop-sony-ps5-playstation-5-restock-availability-retail-store"&gt;last week’s in-person restock of the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, GameStop is once again hosting another day of in-store new console sales. This time, it will take place on Thursday, December 23rd, and include both the standard, disc drive-equipped &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fxbox-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. This event is exclusive to GameStop Pro members, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22604013%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which costs $14.99 per year and can be purchased online in advance&lt;/a&gt;. GameStop has listed &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/PS5_12-23_Event_Stores"&gt;the participating stores for both PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/XBox_12-23_Event_Stores"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; on its website, indicating that more locations are stocking Sony’s console — 598 stores with PS5s Thursday, compared to 277 listed for Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBHNfH"&gt;Though the PS5 may be more readily available Thursday, both consoles have been difficult to buy online, even with frequent restocks happening every week in the month of December. This may be the last chance to get a PS5 or Xbox Series X in time for Christmas, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22848923/nintendo-switch-oled-model-console-microsoft-xbox-series-s-in-stock-stores-amazon-best-buy-walmart"&gt;the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch OLED are readily available elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJbhm1"&gt;GameStop’s penchant for only offering new consoles in bundle form means purchasing either console will also include accessories and games. &lt;em&gt;The Shortcut’s&lt;/em&gt; Matt Swider has &lt;a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/exclusive-ps5-restock-at-gamestop"&gt;once again reported leaks from GameStop&lt;/a&gt; that detail the contents of these bundles. Thursday’s PS5 bundle should match last week’s offering, including &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, a third-party DualSense charging station, an additional Sony DualSense controller, and a $50 GameStop gift card. The Xbox Series X bundle comes with &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a $100 GameStop gift card. Both bundles may run upwards of $740, and participating stores are stocking up to 60 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Own goal for Arsenal FC as regulator bans crypto fan token ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Arsenal" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZuwaLonP2qjuzta20dWecdKItN8=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70307327/arsenalfootballclub1_1020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nb3Oxx"&gt;It seems everyone’s into cryptocurrency these days, including Premier League soccer teams. But Britain’s advertising regulator was unimpressed with the branding around the latest token offering from Arsenal FC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzY58l"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/arsenal-football-club-plc-a21-1121873-arsenal-football-club-plc.html"&gt;ruling made Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned two web promotions for Arsenal’s crypto-based token on the grounds that they failed to explain risk and misled fans about the volatility of cryptocurrency assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Fr08"&gt;The two ads promoted the $AFC token, one via a Facebook post and one on a web page, and were published in August of 2021. The Facebook post encouraged fans to claim a token in order to vote on what song would be played when the team wins a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugsksR"&gt;“[Arsenal players] Ben White, Calum Chambers and Kieran Tierney have had their say,” the post read. “But what song do you want to hear when we win? Download the Socios app to get your token and vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9yq4S"&gt;The Socios platform has become popular with clubs around the world for issuing tokens to fans. As with many cryptocurrency-based governance projects, holding tokens allows users to vote on the outcome of certain decisions made by the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDYHoE"&gt;To gain additional tokens, fans would need to first buy another cryptocurrency, Chiliz, and use this to purchase tokens. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/arsenal-football-club-plc-a21-1121873-arsenal-football-club-plc.html"&gt;text of the ASA’s ruling&lt;/a&gt;, the regulator took issue with the fact that risks associated with buying, trading, and investing cryptocurrency were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HE53Gm"&gt;Even the use of the word “token” disguised the risk involved, the ASA said, with inexperienced customers “unlikely to understand that the ad referred to cryptoassets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AElPkP"&gt;“We considered that cryptoassets were a volatile investment, subject to frequent change and one that could potentially lead to large losses,” the ruling said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DTrfPP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We considered that cryptoassets were a volatile investment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFtfiz"&gt;In a statement, an Arsenal spokesman said: “We take our responsibilities with regard to marketing to our fans very seriously. We carefully considered the communications to fans regarding our promotions and provided information regarding financial risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Di7QS7"&gt;The webpage for the $AFC token now &lt;a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/afc-fan-token-everything-you-need-know"&gt;contains a substantial disclaimer&lt;/a&gt; on investment volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbNp1o"&gt;Though the ruling from the ASA specifically concerns Arsenal, it will likely set a precedent for other clubs offering similar promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teSAUR"&gt;Clubs in the five major European leagues have &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59596267"&gt;made hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; selling fan tokens, according to analysis commissioned by the BBC. The club that generated the most revenue was the Italian Serie A stalwart Lazio, which sold $130 million worth of its token to fans — but these were also the tokens that had dropped the most in value after the first day of trading.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Level’s planning a very visible keypad for its very invisible smart locks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwffuL2spKbZ9WMVdZJIXoWLlnI=/559x0:1920x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70307238/hero_keypad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Level&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znBkh6"&gt;Level teased a new keypad product on its website today (&lt;em&gt;via &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://homekitnews.com/2021/12/22/level-to-introduce-keypad-to-lineup-for-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HomeKit News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that will give owners of the company’s elegant and discreet Level Touch smart locks another way to access their homes. The Level Keypad will also apparently work with previous models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304792/level-lock-smart-homekit-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;original design&lt;/a&gt; that hid inside existing deadbolt hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pttikw"&gt;A keypad would solve one of the main complaints on Level’s locks — that there’s no key-less entry option for those not carrying a smartphone (which kids might not have) or a linked NFC keycard. It also gives an option to share separate access codes for guests or workers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGjW8fKhKL7IMFK8aDzarwZsLjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120830/level_keypad_in_use.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Level via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://homekitnews.com/2021/12/22/level-to-introduce-keypad-to-lineup-for-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;HomeKit News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Level Keypad in use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YNfM47"&gt;Delivering a keypad shows that Level has branched out to a more visible system, when previously, the company focused on designs that hide any sign of a smart home. Other smart lock products have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/28/11317212/august-doorbell-cam-smart-keypad-release-date-hands-on"&gt;already offered&lt;/a&gt; keypads as an optional solution for years — many even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;opting&lt;/a&gt; to integrate it to the deadbolt itself, like with the Yale Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lw7Vk"&gt;The keypad itself is a weather-proof, modern-looking silver touch slate with a white bezel trim. The buttons are all touch-sensitive and LED-backlit. This also marks the first product that has an obvious logo of the company visible to users front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEH2xjCuqcEAnyLTGnbWuLXUsIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120152/juno_modal_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Level&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only details provided about the Keypad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv3jCH"&gt;The company says to install this new keypad nearby the lock it will be used with. All of Level’s products use a battery-sipping Bluetooth LE connection, which means fewer hassles with needing to replace batteries. Using Bluetooth does also mean it requires more planning to make sure the connection can reach a compatible hub if you want to use features like HomeKit automations or out of home control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJ13PG"&gt;Level says to expect the keypad to arrive in January 2022. No pricing has yet been made available, though we expect we’ll see more about the Level Keypad at CES next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon briefly banned itself on Twitch after rogue host exposed herself on air</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ieeUATmMyq-Xd2Pr67g752ZH_ro=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70307198/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4qQlkM"&gt;In a weird internet mix-up, it looks like Amazon briefly suspended its &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/primevideoes"&gt;Spanish-language Prime Video Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday after a host exposed herself on-air, according to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59730006"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ban was lifted after less than 24 hours, according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-manages-to-ban-its-own-prime-video-account-from-twitch/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the broadcast appears to have been deleted from the channel. But it’s a bit unusual for Amazon to essentially ban itself; the e-comm giant has &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-buys-twitch-2014-8"&gt;owned Twitch since 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubWgBs"&gt;The dustup occurred during the talk show “Esto es un Late,” towards the end of what the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; described as an hours-long broadcast. “We’re about to be banned,” said host and comedian Henar Alvarez while lifting up her shirt during the livestream. “Come on. They’re going to ban us!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mExV5Y"&gt;As reported by the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;, after she briefly exposed her nipple, the camera quickly cut away from Alvarez. The channel displayed a title card for a few seconds before putting the camera back on a fully clothed Alvarez and her colleagues. A few hours after the livestream ended, the channel was banned before being unbanned less than a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZhfY2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;¿y ahora cómo le explico esto a mis jefes? &lt;a href="https://t.co/9iu5EmBfqE"&gt;https://t.co/9iu5EmBfqE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Prime Video España (@PrimeVideoES) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideoES/status/1472957869616152590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SCvkuq"&gt;When StreamerBans, a Twitter account that tracks the latest bans on Twitch, documented Twitch’s ruling on the Spanish Prime Video channel, Prime Video España quote tweeted it, saying, “And now how do I explain this to my bosses?” Alvarez later responded with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/henarconh/status/1472983433622269960"&gt;another quote tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Tell them I promise that from now on I will always wear a bra to host the show. I am very sorry, I was wrong and it will not happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tfic0o"&gt;Twitch has set &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/community-guidelines/sexualcontent/#sexually-suggestive-content"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; regarding nudity and sexually suggestive content, and for those who present as women, exposing nipples is not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFHfEJ"&gt;While it seems like Alvarez knew the rules before she lifted her shirt on camera, it’s not clear why she took action that would get the channel banned, even temporarily. It’s possible it was an attempt to garner views for the show or perhaps just something she did on a whim. But it does raise the question of how Amazon can potentially use bans to its own advantage — a high-profile account that gets suspended from a platform typically gets a lot of publicity, never mind Amazon getting banned from its own platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7iHl6"&gt;A Twitch representative declined to comment on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5PhUH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 4:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Twitch declined to provide a comment in line with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/press-room/22772113/the-verge-on-background-policy-update"&gt;&lt;em&gt;on background policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now take Zoom calls from your Amazon television</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Czq4mSXyAz1aKDpjrs-ZvNVOW4Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70307113/DSCF6059.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2jARMD"&gt;Amazon launched its own branded Fire TV television sets last month with attractively low price tags &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa"&gt;for a large, if underwhelming, 4K screen&lt;/a&gt; — and today, they’re getting the promised Zoom video calling app so you can chat with family and friends this holiday season (and beyond). While we noted that Zoom was missing at launch and merely “coming soon” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822788/amazon-fire-tv-smart-home-dashboard-alexa-home-theater-now-available"&gt;as of December 7th&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has managed to roll it out in time for Christmas and New Year’s celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0T1mBi"&gt;There’s no camera built into these TVs, of course. &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/zoom-now-available-on-fire-tv-omni-series-1aad0b4ec30d"&gt;As Amazon explains in its official blog post,&lt;/a&gt; you’ll need a compatible USB webcam to make it work, one with 720p or 1080p resolution, and the company only specifically lists the Logitech C920, C922x, and C310 as examples. And even if you have a good microphone on that webcam or a set of excellent speakers, you won’t be able to use them: Amazon notes that the Zoom app will use your TV microphone and TV speakers for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35fODz"&gt;That said, it sounds like an easy way to put your family celebration up on the big screen, compared to the mess of laptop, webcam and cable, HDMI cable, and laptop power cable that I’ve found myself using to do the same thing. The video shows you won’t even need to dig through Amazon’s app store to find the Zoom app; “Alexa, find Zoom” will get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_Ws5bBYT8Gi2QNoxSgDum3kM1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120761/1_epCIVlfll_Xe4TYjkn1m6Q.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zV6HEB"&gt;Amazon also brought Zoom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599977/amazon-fire-tv-cube-zoom-calls-available"&gt;to its second-gen Fire TV Cube this July&lt;/a&gt;, though not the first-gen Cube. Its Fire TV Sticks don’t have a USB port to plug in a webcam, anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rW2Jj"&gt;If picture quality isn’t important to you, the sets are on sale now. The two most popular sizes are currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$410 for the 55-inch model&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$660 for the 65-inch one&lt;/a&gt;. For budget buyers, we’d probably recommend TCL’s 6-Series Roku TVs instead, but Zoom isn’t currently available on Roku, and you’d pay about $100 more for the set.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Marvel Games got its groove back</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5xj8T0_eFO7Ncymqv0EKUq3oFE=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70307107/marvel_hed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kj6jII"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; winning Best Narrative was one of the biggest surprises of the 2021 Game Awards. Not only was the category absolutely stacked — featuring serial 10/10 earner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and eventual Game of the Year winner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352157/it-takes-two-interview-developer-josef-fares-hazelight-studio-co-op"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but Marvel titles not released by Insomniac Games were known for being critical disappointments. So it was a huge achievement for &lt;em&gt;Guardians &lt;/em&gt;to take the category, beating out games that were far and away easy favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgwYqF"&gt;The win was validation for Jay Ong, EVP of Marvel Games, and his team’s long-term strategy for becoming “the world’s best creative consultancy” by partnering with developers that make games that resonate with fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU4bHW"&gt;“This was a huge win,” Ong told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “A key thing was that they got the heart right, which is at the center of a lot of the Marvel stories.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q571nm"&gt;For the longest time, Marvel games weren’t known for their quality. In the early aughts, games like &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt; were little more than playable versions of Marvel’s blockbuster movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e319a"&gt;“[Our] games were tied to movie releases,” Ong said. “One of the things that we realized very early on was that that was a recipe for very subpar games.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoZwqMVeV-jJTChFxHd2M3DZ--I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120606/Marvels_Avengers_STORY_2_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite poor overall reception, Marvel’s Avengers single-player campaign centered on Kamala Khan was the game’s high point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qd3RMw"&gt;In 2014, Ong described a sea change that saw the company pivot away from the “inconsistencies” of the past. The team decided to prioritize “quality over other things like monetization or IP,” Ong said. “And so, we completely restructured the business around how to work with the best, most elite talent possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbjHJZ"&gt;This singular focus on elite talent led to partnerships with Insomniac, developers of &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;; Firaxis of &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; renown; and &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&lt;/em&gt; devs Eidos Montreal. Marvel Games would provide the IP and some creative input, but the developers would have the freedom to tell whatever stories they desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dESeIL"&gt;Ong described attracting these quality developers as a kind of courtship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxNpdu"&gt;“It’s actually kind of like our secret sauce,” he said. But rather than keep secret the details of how the sauce(sage) gets made, he outlined an elaborate and almost romantic process involving getting to know a studio’s likes, dislikes, and passions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcqu0d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We completely restructured the business around how to work with the best, most elite talent possible”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m2Zt7P"&gt;“We talk about the creative process,” Ong said. “Do we have the same cultural fit? Do we have the same strategic alignment in terms of what we want this game to be?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2gMoz"&gt;For Marvel Games, it’s all about finding the right fit between studio and IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKxlGa"&gt;“We want to work with partners whose games we want to play,” Ong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qlZpt"&gt;For the Disney-owned publisher, it’d be easy for Marvel Games to show up at a dev’s door with the biggest bag of cash and a mandate to make whatever Mr. Mouse desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcYraH"&gt;But part of Marvel Games’ new approach centers on a developer-driven relationship in which Marvel offers some input guided by its knowledge of the entertainment world but largely leaves the devs steering the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k6iWG"&gt;“We don’t start with ‘Can you make this game?’” Ong said. “It’s more of a ‘What would&lt;em&gt; you&lt;/em&gt; like to do with us?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxiDtT"&gt;That’s how&lt;em&gt; Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; came to be. Ong relayed a story of getting “pinged out of the blue” by Eidos Montreal with an idea for a &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch8hif"&gt;“He had a ton of passion for it,” Ong said of the studio head who approached him with the &lt;em&gt;Guardians &lt;/em&gt;pitch. “He was literally saying, ‘We were made to do this.’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2D_WBrkWf2Ssgoce_4n80daerI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120617/MGG_2021_06_14_scr_04.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to having a surprisingly heartfelt story, Guardians of the Galaxy is also visually stunning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7RzIQq"&gt;“And we love &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex,&lt;/em&gt;” Ong continued. “We played the heck out of those games. Since we were very familiar with the team and what they do, we thought that would translate really well to &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J90HIZ"&gt;Indeed, the most common refrain from &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt;’ reviews, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt;, was that it was a delightful surprise. Eidos Montreal and its partnership with Marvel was able to translate what they loved about&lt;em&gt; Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; into a critically successful game capable of winning narrative awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5AR8HU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to work with partners whose games we want to play.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gqslHD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt;’ success is the tip of the iceberg of what fans can expect from Marvel games in the future. While Ong wouldn’t share specifics on just what players can look forward to, he did say upcoming games would explore stories and characters beyond X-Men, Spidey, and the Avengers — franchises that have all but dominated Marvel games in the past. Future Marvel games also hold promise of branching out from the typical kind of action games&lt;em&gt; Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; have been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg4FR7"&gt;“We want to make games for all the different types of Marvel fans,” Ong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feCe5d"&gt;Guided by a set of principles with an eye toward quality talent, Marvel Games’ strategy seems to be working. On top of &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;’s best narrative win, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; and its spinoff &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; are regarded as must-play titles for the PlayStation. Earlier this year, Marvel Games announced &lt;a href="https://skydance.com/news/skydance-new-media-joins-forces-with-marvel-entertainment-to-create-an-all-new-interactive-title/"&gt;its partnership&lt;/a&gt; with former Naughty Dog creative director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971217/amy-hennig-skydance-media-studio-streaming-platforms"&gt;Amy Hennig’s game studio&lt;/a&gt; and that a new Wolverine title was in development at Insomniac Games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzt2EO"&gt;Players are excited about Marvel games in a way they haven’t been in a long time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccrwBP"&gt;“It’s validation,” Ong said. “You try and have the right north star, right guiding principles, working with the right partners. Magic happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laJa1W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahLyt8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0IyW2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7bKOQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
