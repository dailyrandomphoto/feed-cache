    <title>New research shows how many important links on the web get lost to time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dgSfp3Rp-yTwT8XGEjAtUFCU3CY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325496/VRG_ILLO_4489_003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y63Zsg"&gt;A quarter of the deep links in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;articles are now rotten, leading to completely inaccessible pages, &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/linkrot-content-drift-new-york-times.php"&gt;according to a team of researchers&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard Law School, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1395750908349325315?s=20"&gt;worked with the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ digital team&lt;/a&gt;. They found that this problem affected over half of the articles containing links in the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s catalog going back to 1996, illustrating the problem of link rot and how difficult it is for context to survive on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1K0Xf"&gt;The study looked at over 550,000 articles, which contained over 2.2 million links to external websites. It found that 72 percent of those links were “deep,” or pointing to a specific page rather than a general website. Predictably, it found that, as time went on, links were more likely to be dead: 6 percent of links in 2018 articles were inaccessible, while a whopping 72 percent of links from 1998 were dead. For a recent, widespread example of link rot in practice, just look at what happened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222371/trump-ban-twitter-link-rot-embedded-dead-posts"&gt;when Twitter banned Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;: all of the articles that were embedded in his tweets were littered with gray boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A reverse view of link rot over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gPXwdI"&gt;The team chose &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;in part because the paper is known for its archiving practices, but it’s not suggesting the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is all that unusual in its link rot problems. Rather, it’s using the paper of record as an example of a phenomenon that happens all across the internet. As time goes by, the websites that once provided valuable insight, important context, or proof of contentious claims through links will be bought and sold, or simply just stop existing, leaving the link to lead to an empty page — or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BWrhw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/links-for-sale-on-major-news-wesbites"&gt;reported in 2019&lt;/a&gt; on the underground industry that exists where customers can pay marketers to find dead links in big outlets like the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; and buy the domain for themselves. Then, they can do whatever they want with the link, like using it to advertise products or to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1395756927959842821?s=20"&gt;host a message making fun&lt;/a&gt; of the article’s subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04MASF"&gt;Link rot doesn’t just affect journalism, either. Imagine if Rick Astley’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;“Never Gonna Give You Up” video&lt;/a&gt; was deleted and reuploaded. There would be countless Reddit threads and tweet replies that would no longer make sense to future readers. Or imagine if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;trying to display your NFT&lt;/a&gt;, and you discover that the source link now points to nowhere. What a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qwy0ir"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Until we find a solution, articles will continue to lose more and more context as time goes on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="axkXsH"&gt;There has been some work done in trying to preserve links. Wikipedia, for example, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Preventing_and_repairing_dead_links"&gt;asks that contributors writing citations&lt;/a&gt; provide a link to a page’s archive on sites like the Wayback Machine if they think an article is likely to change. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2014/03/perma-scoping-and-addressing-the-problem-of-link-and-reference-rot-in-legal-citations/"&gt;Perma.cc project&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to fix the issue of link rot in legal citations and academic journals by providing an archived version of the page, along with a link to the original source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVirSD"&gt;It’s unlikely, though, that the smattering of similar projects out there would be able to solve the issue for the entire internet, including social networks, or even just for journalists. Until we find a solution, articles will continue to lose more and more context as time goes on. As a perfect example: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/15/3021913/chesapeake-digital-preservation-group-link-rot-report"&gt;our article on link rot from 2012&lt;/a&gt; has a source link to The Chesapeake Digital Preservation Group, which now leads to a 404 page. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch launches a dedicated ‘hot tubs’ category after advertiser pushback</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9nIAT9EbIaTLR-wU1rO943SWIE=/0x0:2463x1642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325278/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_3.08.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of Twitch’s new hot tubs category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7X1K7G"&gt;Twitch is launching a dedicated category for hot tub streams after claiming that it has received pushback from advertisers and viewers about how the trend has taken over the platform. The new “&lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pools%2C%20Hot%20Tubs%2C%20and%20Beaches"&gt;Pools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches&lt;/a&gt;” category is meant to let creators stream what they want, while also giving Twitch advertisers a more convenient way to prevent ads from running on streams that they don’t approve of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqfLdl"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442733/amouranth-twitch-ads-suspended-indefinitely"&gt;Twitch pulled advertising&lt;/a&gt; from some hot tub streamers without warning. In a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;today, the company said that was a mistake. “We did not alert impacted creators at the time, and we should have–our creators rely on us,” a spokesperson said. Twitch said the ads were suspended at advertisers’ request and that it’s now working with individual creators to “restore ads where appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa7gyl"&gt;In particular, the ad suspension hit Amouranth, who is one of the platform’s biggest streamers. Her channel is now showing ads again, though it appears her hot tub streams have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qeyor0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“First and foremost, no one deserves to be harassed for the content they choose to stream.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xwYbkO"&gt;Twitch says its policies on what is and isn’t allowed on the platform aren’t changing. The company is not going to prevent people from streaming in hot tubs or swimwear. While sexually suggestive content remains banned, context-appropriate clothing — like bathing suits in a pool — is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crO0uY"&gt;“Being found to be sexy by others is not against our rules, and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women, or anyone on our service, for their perceived attractiveness,” the company wrote, in bold, in &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/lets-talk-about-hot-tub-streams/"&gt;a blog post this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. The post is a surprisingly direct message from a tech company laying out the competing interests and problems being faced in a situation that most other companies would address in a vague manner at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCysgl"&gt;Hot tub streamers tend to be women, and they’ve often faced sexist harassment from men who don’t like seeing them or their success on Twitch. Twitch’s new system plays into that to an extent — it pulls their streams out of the very popular “Just Chatting” section and moves it into the brand-new hot tub section — but it also validates that this type of streaming is allowed and welcomed on the platform. In its blog post, the company says “first and foremost, no one deserves to be harassed for the content they choose to stream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUlyjO"&gt;Twitch says that adding a new category is not its long-term solution to giving advertisers more control over what streams their ads run on. But it views this as a short-term solution, saying it allows viewers to avoid or seek out hot tub content and gives creators a place to continue streaming it. Brands will be able to opt in or out of placing ads on streams in that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE4UnC"&gt;That could be bad news for creators, though. The so-called “&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitchs-hot-tub-meta-has-sparked-off-yet-another-debate-1846600932"&gt;hot tub meta&lt;/a&gt;” has been a huge success for streamers, but part of the reason for participating in it is that more viewers generally means more ad revenue. If Twitch can’t get advertisers to opt into the hot tubs section, there may be fewer streamers willing to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create an Instagram carousel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sUOgBQCshoJtP1J8MW0mCtdXzLg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325159/akrales_200423_3988_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0UPQiE"&gt;Whenever we use an app continuously, any change to the UI of that app can cause stress — and during these stressful times, who needs more? For example, in a recent update, Instagram tweaked the way it asks its users to create carousels (groups of up to 10 photos or videos that rotate through a single post), and this is apparently causing a bit of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKGaOI"&gt;This new method was pointed out in the Instagram account Digital Mums, where you can find some great tips on how to use various features of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NKUS6r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CPGkaaEjl1R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:16px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CPGkaaEjl1R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" background:#FFFFFF; line-height:0; padding:0 0; text-align:center; text-decoration:none; width:100%;" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;div style=" display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; &lt;div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="padding: 19% 0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block; height:50px; margin:0 auto 12px; width:50px;"&gt;&lt;svg width="50px" height="50px" viewbox="0 0 60 60" version="1.1" xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="https://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;&lt;g stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;g transform="translate(-511.000000, -20.000000)" fill="#000000"&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path d="M556.869,30.41 C554.814,30.41 553.148,32.076 553.148,34.131 C553.148,36.186 554.814,37.852 556.869,37.852 C558.924,37.852 560.59,36.186 560.59,34.131 C560.59,32.076 558.924,30.41 556.869,30.41 M541,60.657 C535.114,60.657 530.342,55.887 530.342,50 C530.342,44.114 535.114,39.342 541,39.342 C546.887,39.342 551.658,44.114 551.658,50 C551.658,55.887 546.887,60.657 541,60.657 M541,33.886 C532.1,33.886 524.886,41.1 524.886,50 C524.886,58.899 532.1,66.113 541,66.113 C549.9,66.113 557.115,58.899 557.115,50 C557.115,41.1 549.9,33.886 541,33.886 M565.378,62.101 C565.244,65.022 564.756,66.606 564.346,67.663 C563.803,69.06 563.154,70.057 562.106,71.106 C561.058,72.155 560.06,72.803 558.662,73.347 C557.607,73.757 556.021,74.244 553.102,74.378 C549.944,74.521 548.997,74.552 541,74.552 C533.003,74.552 532.056,74.521 528.898,74.378 C525.979,74.244 524.393,73.757 523.338,73.347 C521.94,72.803 520.942,72.155 519.894,71.106 C518.846,70.057 518.197,69.06 517.654,67.663 C517.244,66.606 516.755,65.022 516.623,62.101 C516.479,58.943 516.448,57.996 516.448,50 C516.448,42.003 516.479,41.056 516.623,37.899 C516.755,34.978 517.244,33.391 517.654,32.338 C518.197,30.938 518.846,29.942 519.894,28.894 C520.942,27.846 521.94,27.196 523.338,26.654 C524.393,26.244 525.979,25.756 528.898,25.623 C532.057,25.479 533.004,25.448 541,25.448 C548.997,25.448 549.943,25.479 553.102,25.623 C556.021,25.756 557.607,26.244 558.662,26.654 C560.06,27.196 561.058,27.846 562.106,28.894 C563.154,29.942 563.803,30.938 564.346,32.338 C564.756,33.391 565.244,34.978 565.378,37.899 C565.522,41.056 565.552,42.003 565.552,50 C565.552,57.996 565.522,58.943 565.378,62.101 M570.82,37.631 C570.674,34.438 570.167,32.258 569.425,30.349 C568.659,28.377 567.633,26.702 565.965,25.035 C564.297,23.368 562.623,22.342 560.652,21.575 C558.743,20.834 556.562,20.326 553.369,20.18 C550.169,20.033 549.148,20 541,20 C532.853,20 531.831,20.033 528.631,20.18 C525.438,20.326 523.257,20.834 521.349,21.575 C519.376,22.342 517.703,23.368 516.035,25.035 C514.368,26.702 513.342,28.377 512.574,30.349 C511.834,32.258 511.326,34.438 511.181,37.631 C511.035,40.831 511,41.851 511,50 C511,58.147 511.035,59.17 511.181,62.369 C511.326,65.562 511.834,67.743 512.574,69.651 C513.342,71.625 514.368,73.296 516.035,74.965 C517.703,76.634 519.376,77.658 521.349,78.425 C523.257,79.167 525.438,79.673 528.631,79.82 C531.831,79.965 532.853,80.001 541,80.001 C549.148,80.001 550.169,79.965 553.369,79.82 C556.562,79.673 558.743,79.167 560.652,78.425 C562.623,77.658 564.297,76.634 565.965,74.965 C567.633,73.296 568.659,71.625 569.425,69.651 C570.167,67.743 570.674,65.562 570.82,62.369 C570.966,59.17 571,58.147 571,50 C571,41.851 570.966,40.831 570.82,37.631"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s696FR"&gt;If you’d prefer some text instructions on how to navigate the change, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="iRP9Vi"&gt;In your Instagram app (iOS or Android), select the “Add Post” icon (the plus icon on the top line)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9BdrGQ"&gt;You’ll see a selection of your photos. You can change the source of your photos if you wish by clicking on the source name (Recents, Videos, etc.) and then choosing a different one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EjVVNL"&gt;Press and hold the first photo or video you want to include in your carousel until the number 1 appears in the corner of the photo. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZcXzH3"&gt;If you’re using Android, there will be a “Select Multiple” icon above your photo gallery. If you want, you can perform the same task by tapping on the first image you want to include, and then tapping on the “Select Multiple” icon. (The iOS version doesn’t include that icon, so you’re stuck with “press and hold.”)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Press and hold the first image you want to include" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2MGFDHLXsqwl45Ld_bVrRE0knPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531309/IMG_2D26DF6DE260_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and hold the first image you want to include, and then select the rest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Press and hold the first image you want to include" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRrg9IIrNO7cYtl_qzUdXZ3kBBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531220/Instagram_1aScreenshot__May_21__2021_1_41_49_PM_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Android version, there is also a “Select Multiple” icon you can use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0lAr5B"&gt;Continue to select the images you want to include. They will be numbered in the order in which you select them. In order to change the order, you’ll have to tap on the numbers on the images you want to re-order, and then add them back in their correct order. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oY4pKx"&gt;Once you’ve got all your photos selected and in the correct order, choose the “Next” arrow in the top right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5bUYEf"&gt;Now you can edit or apply a filter to one or all of your photos. You can then go on to the final “New Post” screen that lets you write a caption, tag people, post to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gSGTLl"&gt;Easy-peasy — until, of course, the next time Instagram decides to alter its interface...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citizen, the vigilante justice app, has a plan to deploy private security forces, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpzNxcu_oy1ZmpJu91d8t7O6w1k=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325155/citizen_suf_security.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="evuFVS"&gt;This morning, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published a story about how Citizen — an app that appears to encourage vigilante justice — encouraged its users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles"&gt;to hunt down &lt;em&gt;the wrong person&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and presumably bring them to justice, in the mistaken assumption that person had started the 1,158-acre Palisades wildfire in Los Angeles last week. The company offered a $30,000 bounty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUHfZh"&gt;Now, we’re learning the same company is apparently planning to offer its own private security forces to users, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7evbx/citizen-app-private-security-leaked-emails"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXziIE"&gt;In fact, one Citizen-branded patrol car has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brandonwenerd/status/1395045423958478849"&gt;already been spotted&lt;/a&gt; in the wild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ds8kB5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Few things make you feel like you live in a bleak dystopian reality like a Citizen App patrol car that looks like a cop car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spotted by ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/magggggiiieeeee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@magggggiiieeeee&lt;/a&gt;⁩ on the 10. &lt;a href="https://t.co/B7ppqymXSd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B7ppqymXSd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— brandon wenerd (@brandonwenerd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brandonwenerd/status/1395045423958478849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iYw4qs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s report goes further than that, though, digging through internal documents and speaking to former employees who describe a “privatized secondary emergency response network” that would respond to an app user’s request. So far, Citizen appears to have been contracting that work out, both to well-known private security provider Securitas and — in the picture above — Los Angeles Professional Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmyZss"&gt;Citizen confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that it was at least internally testing a “personal rapid response service,” suggesting it might be as simple as an escort service users would summon if they’re afraid to walk home late at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFLHik"&gt;But the app’s history — originally launched as Vigilante in 2016 — not to mention the idea that this company is apparently willing to encourage its users to hunt down suspects for money, suggest that this move could be... a little problematic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClkCJz"&gt;Social networks and apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests"&gt;like Nextdoor&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon’s Ring Neighbors have already been roundly criticized for preying on people’s fears, encouraging them to report on suspicious activity in their neighborhood, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/18/ring-nest-surveillance-doorbell-camera/"&gt;normalizing surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, and unfairly targeting their neighbors based on racial bias. Combine that with a company that might encourage users to take justice into their own hands, and that seems not great.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO’s Pause with Sam Jay turns the stuffy late-night talk show into a party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XPuV-5A6Q4Y5c6mnW45TqNzZZw=/124x0:1461x891/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325147/sam_jay.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: HBO / WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLPdLD"&gt;There’s a quality that some long-running chat podcasts have that can feel like a brick wall for new listeners. Existing relationships, in-jokes, and context that friends and co-hosts have are additional barriers to feeling like you’re a part of the conversation. The casual hangout and chat format is tantalizing for its naturalism, but it also comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17832948/youtube-youtubers-influencer-creator-fans-subscribers-friends-celebrities"&gt;parasocial relationships&lt;/a&gt; as baggage. Which makes HBO’s new late-night project, &lt;em&gt;Pause with Sam Jay,&lt;/em&gt; so intriguing. It has hangout podcasts in its DNA, but it’s also out to reinvent a decades-old late-night format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ikxFf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pause &lt;/em&gt;is co-created by Sam Jay, stand-up comedian and &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; writer, and Prentice Penny, showrunner and executive producer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16145498/insecure-broad-city-high-maintenance-web-series-hbo-comedy-central"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insecure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It feels fresh for some obvious reasons. Jay is a Black queer woman in a field filled with straight white men. But aside from the host, the format also feels unique. Where late night is dominated by monologues, desks, interviews, and panels, &lt;em&gt;Pause&lt;/em&gt; is quite literally a party. Jay invites over her real-life friends and fellow comedians, and they shoot the shit, filmed by two camera operators, while Jay guides the conversation toward the episode’s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="muNQ7O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5zPy0VLxBM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08tuOV"&gt;For the episode I watched, that subject was selling out to white culture, or “cooning.” Jay and her guests think bigger than that, too, touching on the sorts of restrictions, labels, and classifications society can place on people who just want to be. The party atmosphere doesn’t always help communicate these ideas. Like a real kickback or house party, people shout over each other, ideas get lost in the mix, and jokes that play in the room just don’t translate without the context and history. But when it does work — or when Jay’s two white guests are gamely dunked on — it feels like something that’s never been available from this kind of show before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cja10n"&gt;This can make the diversions Jay and Penny take slightly frustrating. To support the natural discussion at the party, &lt;em&gt;Pause &lt;/em&gt;weaves in cutaways. There’s nothing necessarily wrong or unfunny about interviews, sketches, or man-on-the-street segments. But they have a very different vibe from a party, and the hangout atmosphere is what makes Jay’s project seem like a shot in the arm when you’re on its wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH3ELM"&gt;And it should! If Conan O’Brien&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/conan-obriens-tbs-show-format-change-explained-1108410/"&gt;switching up his format&lt;/a&gt;, shooting for a shorter length, and literally getting out from behind his desk can be a major milestone in 2019, then clearly, late-night television needs &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. In recent years, networks have turned to YouTube for inspiration (&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-late-night-ad-revenue-20150818-story.html"&gt;and extra ad sales&lt;/a&gt;). Segments on shows are frequently designed to be clippable and ready to be shared online, and networks like NBC have poached &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20847627/lilly-singh-late-night-youtube-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers-nbc"&gt;successful YouTube talent like Lilly Singh&lt;/a&gt; to offer relevancy and audience instincts to network late night. Jay and Penny are obviously working the problem from a different angle — and from behind an HBO subscription — but the instinct that the old ways can’t be the only way is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4zaWa"&gt;One episode is not a lot to go on, but like the start of a great night with friends, there’s a ton of potential energy in &lt;em&gt;Pause&lt;/em&gt; (despite what the name might suggest). There’s plenty of avenues the show could go down, but the most promising is playing with the party format and building out Jay’s guests as sources of humor and insight all their own. For now, though, it’s fun in its own way. Watching people drink, joke, and play pool just feels more engaging than an interview behind a desk — especially during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hS9ccy"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pause with Sam Jay &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;premieres on HBO on May 21st at 9PM ET and will also stream on HBO Max.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I do not understand this chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVDeK5-Ff3m8sDc8T5hJIpTPS4g=/207x0:2103x1264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325068/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_2.12.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjR97U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Stevens/status/1395447923463245824"&gt;It started with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Tim Stevens. A picture of a chair that seemed to effortlessly skim the line between office chair, La-Z-Boy recliner, and Victorian throne. An utter affront to design, taste, and style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWUDDx"&gt;This chair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sZZa0W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Stumbled across this chair online today. I find its middle-management, aspirational evil overlord aesthetic oddly chilling. &lt;a href="https://t.co/0I41mxQNjF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0I41mxQNjF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Stevens (@Tim_Stevens) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Stevens/status/1395447923463245824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ALNW"&gt;The tweet first crossed my timeline yesterday, and my mind has been consumed for the past 24 hours by the very existence of this chair. Why does it exist? Has anyone actually bought one? Does the chair come with a menacing-looking cat to hold when spinning around to fire your minions? Are you required to shout “I’ll get you next time, Gadget?” when you encounter minor setbacks while seated in it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GyluF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Penn-Executive-Office-Chair-Reclining/dp/B08XQTF8SW/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Wood+Executive+Chair&amp;amp;qid=1621612598&amp;amp;sr=8-6&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Amazon listing&lt;/a&gt;, however, only added to the perplexing nature. The original picture, for example, did not convey the &lt;em&gt;built-in footrest&lt;/em&gt; that this relic possesses. It’s a fact that seems important, although I cannot quite convey why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLntpN"&gt;Another important nugget of information: the Penn Executive Chair’s price, a whopping $1,950, puts it above the cost of the most expensive office chair from Herman Miller or the cushiest, comfiest La-Z-Boy recliner. Then again, why shouldn’t a chair like this, which aspires to ascend beyond the limits of both of those products, feature a price tag that similarly soars above either of its lesser halves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F31is"&gt;(That said, this thing does feature genuine leather, the lowest grade of leather, a disappointing choice for something this pricey.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1F3YgZ04ccFgoLkxyCYQuNKvHdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531202/81lXq9NCVKL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgkpej"&gt;The main vibe of that image is “spikes and manacles are about to pop out of the arm and headrests to imprison a James Bond-style spy in a low-budget (or lowish-budget, again these chairs cost like two grand) thriller movie.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoCEvE"&gt;The rabbit hole tunneled ever deeper. I found the &lt;a href="https://www.pennexecutivechairs.com/"&gt;website of the manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, Penn Executive Chairs, showcasing new styles of the dreaded chair in ever-maddening color schemes, patterns, and tufted leather backs. A second image — the only one I’ve found of a human sitting in one of these chairs — alludes to the scale, one that seems more fitting for a throne than a seat for an office desk. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L2uBKq2NtvXi8AXsRe5xQb2SODU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531193/66036e_bf709998d2394edfa837f70b02510ffd_mv2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYUVSaPpIJcQh-qr9zgpYnr85Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531191/66036e_33d959332384427799fc704d1a52a770_mv2.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p id="Bsv0ES"&gt;I do not think writing this has helped me understand the chair — indeed, I don’t think it is possible to truly &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the nature of this item — but if a giant throne-like recliner shows up as my new desk chair whenever we all return to office life, this is why. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the features I actually want from my pregnancy tracking app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Diana Diller and Pregnancy data" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqNY_rV2YH7F-ohdrPmHpvzzf8E=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324685/1139388741.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pregnancy apps could use some new features.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Philip Cheung for The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7wvV3q"&gt;A great scholar once noted that “there’s an app for that.” Pregnancy is no exception. I use my phone to manage just about everything else in my life, so when I found out I was pregnant, it was a natural next step to go looking for an app to hold my hand through the experience. I’ve been using a couple of popular apps interchangeably — &lt;a href="https://info.oviahealth.com/join"&gt;Ovia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/mobile-app/"&gt;What to Expect&lt;/a&gt; — and generally, they’re pretty good. But I have notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5QYOS"&gt;So without further ado, here’s a list of demands from me, a pregnant lady with no app development experience, to the pregnancy app creators of the world. It’s the impractical pregnancy tracking app of my dreams. And believe it or not, you can use these ideas for free in your next update. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NWmzWi"&gt;A nap alarm that sends a push notification to the other inhabitants of my house to not disturb me when I set it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6GMwXT"&gt;A shortcut to order a Popeyes chicken sandwich on DoorDash with priority delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ksUoul"&gt;A hotline to call when I know I’m being unreasonably emotional but need to cry about something trivial that happened, like “The pharmacist was a little short with me,” or “I just really need to eat a Frosty right now and I’m miles away from the nearest Wendy’s.” My spouse does not need this kind of added stress in his life right now, and I just need a virtual shoulder to cry on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nU1Yxq"&gt;Fetal size comparisons to fast-food menu items. Speak my language, please! I do not know how large a mille-feuille is (and I’ve even seen &lt;em&gt;Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;!), but I know exactly how large a McDonald’s chicken nugget is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HJ1wNL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re not eating for two!” The &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; I’m not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YUD0wX"&gt;Zero mentions of healthy snack recipes, excessive weight gain warnings, or, god forbid, the phrase “You’re not eating for two!” The &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; I’m not. My body is literally creating a whole-ass human from scratch. Sometimes I’m just exhausted, sick of eating baby carrots with hummus, and my soul needs the kind of soothing only a bowl of peanut M&amp;amp;Ms can provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FPQ065"&gt;Push notifications for useful things, like when I actually need to start shopping for a crib or a stroller. In fact, just pick one for me and schedule a Target pickup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3lLUi1"&gt;A “good vibes only” community forum. I like being able to connect with other pregnant people who are due around the same time, but reading about complications in other people’s pregnancies sends me into a worry spiral that I just don’t need right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JV2Dvy"&gt;Daily affirmations that I’m doing fine and whatever food or beverage item I’m worried about putting in my body is probably fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JEGUDm"&gt;Fellow armchair app developers: did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments — just, you know, good vibes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnUK7u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1V5bbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An online community’s shared stories against anti-Asian hate</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A video of her mom’s assault went viral — now she wants to tell a different story about anti-Asian hate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="g7tSsb"&gt;After tucking her mom in for the night, Elizabeth Kari found herself scrolling through comments on her GoFundMe campaign well past 3AM. She had started the campaign to raise money for her mom’s recovery from a now-infamous assault that took place in New York City and to support community groups and other survivors of anti-Asian hate. Soon, people were sending more than donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7WusY"&gt;Some comments shared stories of being brutally attacked, similar to her mother’s. Other heartfelt messages referred to Kari’s mom as “Auntie” or “Tita,” which are terms of respect and endearment for elders in the Filipino community. “You and your mom Vilma make me proud to be an American and a New Yorker,” one comment from April says. “She looks like my mom and it could be any of our mom if we don’t defeat hate crimes and get rid of racism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o7T8A7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How great it would be to bundle up my inbox in a sense, and share it with the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bNDyJq"&gt;“I thought, like, ‘Wow, this is so amazing,’” Kari tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It empowered me, it kept me positive. Every time I faltered a little bit, or got tired, or upset, I would open this GoFundMe,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvz5PF"&gt;It was a welcome change from the exhausting stream of headlines about her mom and other recent incidents of violence against Asian Americans. “It almost makes you kind of want to curl into a ball a little bit more,” Kari tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. To shift the narrative, she started her own storytelling initiative this month called AAP(I Belong).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebG4jr"&gt;After reading the stories on her GoFundMe page, Kari launched a &lt;a href="https://aapibelong.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where people who have experienced anti-Asian hatred can anonymously share “stories and words of encouragement.” She works in fashion and says this is the first time she’s ever undertaken a project like this. Some of the stories are now adorning the walls of the Museum of Chinese in America in New York City. It’s part of an exhibition that’s open until May 22nd during Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. After the exhibition closes, she says she plans to share selected stories online on the AAP(I Belong) website and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/aapibelong/"&gt;Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64N2qT"&gt;“I thought, how great it would be to bundle up my inbox in a sense, and share it with the world,” Kari says. “I could give back to a community all this energy and love they gave to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elizabeth Kari (right) and her mother (Vilma) visited the AAP(I Belong) exhibition at the Museum of Chinese in America together one night before it opened." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Sd3flU3O-UMACZB_XhAelf5PtA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530947/DSC03946__2_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Kari (right) and her mother Vilma (left) visited the AAP(I Belong) exhibition at the Museum of Chinese in America together one night before it opened. “I had chills and a bit of a smile I couldn’t hold back because it was so weird,” Elizabeth says. “Stepping back and actually seeing it and being ready to open the doors was just a very big moment of relief.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BUJR9R"&gt;The outpouring of support came after a video of Kari’s mother, Vilma Kari, went viral a couple months ago. In the footage, a man suddenly kicks Vilma in the stomach as she’s walking past a building. After she falls to the ground, he stomps her in the face three times before walking away. The video sparked outrage, not only because of the violence, but because a bystander can be seen in the footage shutting the door after the incident, leaving Vilma on the ground outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI6XSz"&gt;The name of Kari’s new initiative, “AAP(I) Belong,” is a response to what the man told her mom that day, according to Kari. “He had said, ‘You don’t belong here’ before he assaulted her. So I wanted to kind of use that as a cornerstone of my project and reclaim that word, [belong],” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJRSEe"&gt;Kari also wanted to clear up one misconception that emerged in the media storm that followed the video: that her mom was left to fend for herself after the assault. “What this video did not capture was that there was someone who was standing across the street that witnessed my mom getting attacked who yelled and screamed to get the assailant’s attention,” she writes on the GoFundMe page. “This gesture of action is what we need in our world right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="357JuT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What this video did not capture”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8A6Iya"&gt;What happened to Kari’s mom is part of a rise in violence against Asian Americans that has rocked the community over the past year. Hate crimes against Asian Americans skyrocketed by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-nearly-150-2020-mostly-n-n1260264"&gt;150 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. That year, former President Donald Trump continued the long &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196100/immigration-borders-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;history of using immigrants as scapegoats&lt;/a&gt; for epidemics, repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9578992/donald-trump-chinese-virus-racist-comment-coronavirus"&gt;using racist terms like “China virus” and “Kung Flu”&lt;/a&gt; when talking about COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHFLew"&gt;“We know that people will look at our black hair and ‘yellow’ skin and target us… There’s a lot of anger, a lot of resentment, and also a lot of dread to know that when we go out, we could be subject to racism,” Erin Wen Ai Chew, a 37-year-old with Chinese ancestry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121358/coronavirus-racism-social-media-east-asian-chinese-xenophobia"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last February as prejudice against Asian Americans mounted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ko1iDD"&gt;Advocacy groups rallied last year to take stock of what was happening. In March 2020, several groups came together to create the Stop AAPI Hate reporting center to track hate incidents. More than a year later, their work is still grueling. The group documented &lt;a href="https://stopaapihate.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stop-AAPI-Hate-Report-National-210506.pdf"&gt;6,603 hate incidents&lt;/a&gt; — mostly verbal harassment, but also physical assault, civil rights violations, and online harassment — between March 2020 and March 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbGKSH"&gt;AAP(I Belong) has the potential to paint a fuller picture of what Asian Americans are facing, says Kevin Nadal, an author and professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and Graduate Center at the City University of New York. There are gaps in police reports because of cultural, language, or bureaucratic barriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHab2O"&gt;Kari hopes that by creating a place where people can share their experiences anonymously, she might also encourage them to report those incidents. “One of the biggest things that my mom felt with this incident was, ‘Why me?’ But also, ‘Okay, this happened to me — how many other people have experienced this and didn’t have the resources, or the help, or the support, or, you know, video footage?” Kari says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TCVvwA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How many other people have experienced this and didn’t have the resources, or the help, or the support, or, you know, video footage?” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gzuSrP"&gt;“When you’re targeted by violence, that might feel shaming or that you’re bringing some sort of stigma to yourself and your family,” Nadal says. “They might not want to report hate violence incidents just because it’s a lot of hassle. They might question, for what? To have to go through the process of reporting to several people and sharing your story over and over again when in reality there may not be any justice that you may gain from all of this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcqykq"&gt;There was no justice after the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2021/03/27/981718272/how-vincent-chins-death-gave-others-a-voice"&gt;1982 murder of Vincent Chin&lt;/a&gt;. Chin was beaten to death with a baseball bat by two white auto workers during growing resentment in the US over competition from Japanese carmakers (even though Chin was Chinese American). One of Chin’s assailants was cleared of all charges, while the other was eventually acquitted in a retrial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDlbQH"&gt;That case became a rallying point for Asians in America who have since fought for more protection and recognition within the judicial system and outside of it. Storytelling plays a big role in that movement. The 1987 documentary &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/who-killed-vincent-chin-documentary-anti-asian-violence_n_6054aa02c5b6bd95117c9980"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Killed Vincent Chin?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a film classic directed by Asian American women, has become a grassroots organizing tool often screened during informal teach-ins. Not long after the film was made, the nonprofit Asian American Writers’ Workshop was founded in New York City. It considers itself a &lt;a href="https://aaww.org/about-us/"&gt;“community of activists”&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on “taking stories from the margins and pushing them to the center.” The AAP(I Belong) website adds to that tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvjA3m"&gt;“Using our own language is more empowering — but it’s also better data, it’s more informational. You’re sharing the lived experiences of the people who are actually from those communities who are actually surviving and thriving through many different obstacles,” Nadal says. “Previously, people of historically marginalized groups — especially Black, Indigenous, Asian people, Latinx folks — we were told stories about us, written from colonizers’ or settlers’ perspective, as opposed to using our own language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="84vkqi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Using our own language is more empowering — but it’s also better data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DFfp7V"&gt;Mainstream narratives around hate crimes have been used to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22321234/black-asian-american-tensions-solidarity-history"&gt;sow division between Black and Asian communities and other historically marginalized groups&lt;/a&gt;. Social media was rife with “dehumanizing” language used to describe the man who assaulted Kari’s mom, Nadal says. “It was also something that the media kind of perpetuated like, ‘Here’s a photo of this larger Black man who is just out of jail and killed his mother and now he’s attacking this innocent Asian Filipino woman,’” he says. “Those are things that I find to be problematic because when it comes to these anti Asian American hate crimes, we don’t really hear a lot about the white assailants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRDFno"&gt;Storytelling projects like Kari’s, on the other hand, can bring people together. That’s an important point for Kari, who is multiracial. After her mom was assaulted, organizers reached out to Kari with photos from rallies to stop Asian hate. “I looked at the pictures, it’s really like a sea of all types of people,” Kari says. “It’s really beautiful to see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NlGmZT"&gt;Kari says she’s received some 200 submissions so far for the AAP(I Belong) website. She and her mom pored through them to choose which ones to add to the gallery exhibition that’s open this week. “She’s just happy that while she’s healing she has this,” Kari says. “It’s nice I think for her that there’s a project, something good coming out of the bad so when people talk to us it’s not as fixated on or as associated with her attack. It’s more about this healing process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbdAaf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxg9w9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter labels some Indian politicians’ tweets about COVID-19 as manipulated media</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mh2uWk4IXXHDqRIuIuGkYJsGi5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324269/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;India’s government has criticized Twitter for applying its “manipulated media” label to some Indian politicians’ tweets about COVID-19 efforts, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Indian news &lt;a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.opindia.com/2021/05/govt-slams-twitter-for-labeling-congress-toolkit-tweets-manipulated-media-meity/"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday. The government has asked Twitter to remove the tags out of “fairness and equity,” saying the application of the labels affects the platform’s image as “neutral and unbiased.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68PiW7"&gt;The government sent the notice to Twitter two days after it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1395714092837457931?s=20"&gt;applied the “manipulated media” label&lt;/a&gt; to a tweet by Sambit Patra, of India’s ruling BJP party. Patra said in the tweet, which appears to have been deleted (it’s not clear whether Twitter removed it or if Patra deleted it himself), that opposition party Congress had used a “toolkit” in attempts to subvert the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKkB36"&gt;The BJP party accuses the Congress party of creating the toolkit to damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-the-congress-toolkit-controversy-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/82761578.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, but the Congress party claims the version of the toolkit the BJP is spreading is a faked version of a research note about an unrelated project.  &lt;a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/"&gt;Indian fact-checking organization &lt;em&gt;Alt News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found images of the so-called “COVID toolkit” that Patra and others had tweeted contained some falsified information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzI35U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257"&gt;According to Indian news site &lt;em&gt;The News Minute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Patra’s tweet read: “Friends look at the #CongressToolKit in extending help to the needy during the Pandemic! More of a PR exercise with the help of Friendly Journalists &amp;amp; Influencers than a soulful endeavour. Read for yourselves the agenda of the Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiN2WA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter introduced its manipulated media policy last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AmNwcM"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Friday. The platform &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-approach-to-synthetic-and-manipulated-media.html"&gt;introduced its manipulated media policy&lt;/a&gt; last February, which applies to media that is “significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated.” Video clips or images that have been altered to change their meaning or context could get a label under the rules, and false content presented as true or content found to be “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm” could be removed entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8CLes"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/trump-tweet-label-video/"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; by former US President Donald Trump, who has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, received the manipulated media label last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RDUdx"&gt;Twitter has grappled with local legal requirements in India, particularly with regard to content about the coronavirus pandemic. Late last month, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;removed more than 50 tweets critical&lt;/a&gt; of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic there, at the government’s request. The censored accounts included a sitting member of Parliament and other prominent figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76ZZ3L"&gt;And during protests by farmers in India in February, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/india-twitter.html"&gt;Twitter permanently blocked&lt;/a&gt; more than 500 accounts and removed others from being visible within the country. At the time, the Indian government issued a notice of noncompliance to Twitter, which could have meant jail time for Twitter’s employees in India if the company had refused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGyO25"&gt;According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;India reported&lt;/a&gt; 259,551 new cases of COVID-19 and 4,209 new deaths on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Amazon union case has come down to a mailbox</title>

  &lt;p id="vW8zMc"&gt;For months during the union drive, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, felt like they were being watched. There were cameras around BHM1, the 855,000-square-foot warehouse where workers sorted, scanned, and packed boxes. A uniformed police officer patrolled the parking lot all hours of the day and night. Managers came up to peoples’ workstations to ask how they felt about the organizing campaign. So when Amazon had a new USPS mailbox installed — ostensibly to increase voter turnout — many felt they couldn’t trust it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRvtR3"&gt;“Amazon said only the post office had access to it, but that’s not how it felt,” said Serena Wallace, an employee BHM1 who testified on behalf of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). “I avoided the mailbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y9MFzN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon is trying to paint RWDSU as living in fantasy land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9dvBwT"&gt;Wallace’s comments came during a National Labor Relations Board hearing, where the union is contesting the results of the election it lost in early April. Like most court proceedings, it is both theatrical and crushingly boring. RWDSU is trying to convince the labor board to throw out the results of the vote by proving Amazon violated US labor law. Amazon is trying to paint RWDSU as living in fantasy land, refusing to admit that workers simply do not want a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZFcI"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Amazon spokesperson said: “Despite heavy campaigning from union officials, policymakers, and even some media outlets, our employees overwhelmingly rejected the union’s representation. Rather than accepting that choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda. We look forward to continuing to present the facts of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNovWS"&gt;During the first week of the hearing, the union brought up workers to testify about &lt;a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/rwdsu/pages/764/attachments/original/1618837432/Union's_Objections_to_the_Election__10-RC-269250.pdf?1618837432"&gt;each of its 23 objections&lt;/a&gt;. One of these workers was Hope Pendleton — an employee at BHM1. Pendleton said she attended a captive audience meeting in February where she was told that her benefits and health insurance could be taken away if the union drive was successful. The anti-union messaging was relentless, Pendleton explained. “It was a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ct3ql"&gt;Employees said Amazon texted them multiple times a day with anti-union messages. “Don’t let outsiders divide our winning team,” read one, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1357797923598262280/photo/2"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The union may accept fewer benefits for you in return for taking dues directly out of your check and sending them directly to the union.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrl1bm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What have you ever done for me?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KsTwsj"&gt;Kristine Bell, another worker at BHM1, said she attended a meeting where Amazon managers handed out car tags with anti-union messages like “leave RWDSU in the rear view” and “Vote no.” When a manager asked Bell how she felt about the union, she said she felt good. “But it’ll change the way we communicate and what I can do for you,” the manager allegedly responded. “What have you ever done for me?” Bell asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we3yxg"&gt;Workers testified that they were told that the union would take away their voice and that they wouldn’t be able to speak to managers if they had concerns in the workplace. (This is false; unionized workers can of course still raise concerns to managers.) Amazon’s broader message was clear: the union would come in between the company and its employees — and leave workers worse off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlDaAI"&gt;The barrage of communications made some workers feel pressured and monitored. Voting was supposed to be anonymous — but the constant surveillance made some doubt that was possible. If they supported the union, would Amazon know? Could they lose their jobs in retaliation? The atmosphere grew more tense as the vote drew near. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BUc2s4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If RWDSU can demonstrate that employees &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; the company held sway over the vote, it could be enough to overturn the results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jSVgOM"&gt;The environment workers describe here is critical for the proceedings. The union doesn’t need to prove that Amazon had access to how people voted or manipulated the results. If RWDSU can demonstrate that employees &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; the company held sway over the vote, it could be enough to overturn the results, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/amazon-had-key-to-usps-mailbox-used-for-union-vote-witness-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJeXkQ"&gt;That’s why so much of the case hinges on the mailbox. Employees who testified during the hearing say they were suspicious about its providence — particularly when Amazon erected a tent around it with signs that read “Speak for yourself!” and “Mail your ballot here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YdkLV"&gt;Witness testimony also alleged that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/amazon-had-key-to-usps-mailbox-used-for-union-vote-witness-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Amazon security guards had access to the mailbox&lt;/a&gt; and were seen opening it on at least one occasion. RWDSU even presented emails showing that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/amazon-exec-dave-clark-pushed-for-mailbox-in-alabama-union-election.html"&gt;Amazon executive Dave Clark supported the mailbox installation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJmkV"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said the company only had access to incoming mail addressed to the building. “As we’ve said from the start, this mailbox was secure and Amazon had no access to outgoing mail. Similar to any other mailbox that serves businesses, we had access only to the incoming mailbox where we received mail addressed to the building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQk5jC"&gt;During cross-examination, Amazon’s lawyers tried to get workers to say they hadn’t been forced to use the mailbox, regardless of what it looked like. Here’s an exchange between an attorney for the online retail giant and Darryl Johnson, a BHM1 employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bj39n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; You understood that you could mail your ballot at any mailbox in the Birmingham area, and to the extent that anyone wanted to use that mailbox, that was their choice, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtEbtG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson: &lt;/strong&gt;You could say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dut6CG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon never required employees to use that BHM1 mailbox to mail their ballot, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rItxA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson: &lt;/strong&gt;You mean&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;did they tell employees to use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SG4Qo0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; No, did they require it? Did they command it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08IUuN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson:&lt;/strong&gt; You could say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkOsoW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; The mailbox was a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LgrUOR"&gt;Sounds like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7falf1"&gt;“Even though the NLRB definitively denied Amazon’s request for a dropbox on the warehouse property, Amazon felt it was above the law and worked with the postal service anyway to install one,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum &lt;a href="https://www.rwdsu.info/amazon_illegally_interfered_in_union_vote_rwdsu_to_file_objections_and_related_ulp_charges_to_hold_amazon_accountable_for_their_actions"&gt;in a previously published statement&lt;/a&gt;. “They did this because it provided a clear ability to intimidate workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qaYp8"&gt;Amazon’s lawyers have suggested that the mailbox was just an option; no workers were required to use it. But the pressure-cooker atmosphere that workers described during the hearing suggests otherwise. Whether that will be enough to convince the labor board to throw out the results of the election is anyone’s guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAk2Tt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
