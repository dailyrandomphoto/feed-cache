    <title>The T-Mobile / Sprint merger hasn’t created jobs — it’s ended them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0jsesPQ0YdAAwvd6TmSd7bniQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271585/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="84BbK6"&gt;T-Mobile promised its $26 billion merger with Sprint would add new jobs to the economy literally every single day, but a report from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobiles-hiring-pledge-is-off-to-a-slow-start-11620639002"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirms the newly combined company actually employs fewer people now than it did before the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkS7F9"&gt;Here’s how specific &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fnew-t-mobile-creating-jobs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22429587%2Ft-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s promise was&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NkdxSM"&gt;So, let me be really clear on this increasingly important topic. &lt;strong&gt;This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not just a promise. That’s not just a commitment. It’s a fact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ny04YG"&gt;“Jobs-positive” would not be how I’d describe T-Mobile’s employment practices. The company employed 5,000 fewer people by the end of 2020 than it did before the merger, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes. And before you blame the COVID-19 pandemic, you should know that  wireless executives who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that shrinking the number of jobs was always part of the plan — the pandemic just sped up planned &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/coronavirus-retail-workforce-faces-permanent-decline.html"&gt;job loss on the retail side&lt;/a&gt; of T-Mobile’s business. In fact, T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293293/tmobile-sprint-merger-layoffs-hundreds-biso-jobs-cut"&gt;laid off hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of Sprint’s inside sales team just a few months after its merger was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaabC"&gt;In addition to the “jobs-positive from day one and every day thereafter” claim, which now appears to have been a blatant lie, T-Mobile also specifically promised it would add 11,000 jobs by 2024. Instead, it appears to be moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ9p5"&gt;We were warned this would happen. &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sprint-t-mobile-merger-jobs-20171010-story.html"&gt;Wall Street analysts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/sprint-t-mobile-merger-could-lead-thousands-job-losses-despite-n1134956"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt; both predicted anywhere between 24,000 to 30,000 jobs could be lost if T-Mobile and Sprint got what they wanted. Telecom industry watcher Karl Bode wrote multiple articles for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;highlighting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;how meaningless&lt;/a&gt; the merger promises looked, comparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;Sprint’s own history&lt;/a&gt; of post-merger layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v096vD"&gt;For some context, when Sprint was given the go-ahead to merge with Nextel in 2005, it made its own claims about how great its merger would be for the economy. Bode writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Lg96K1"&gt;Government filings had promised the FCC that the deal would “generate economic growth and jobs in the United States.” Then-Sprint CEO Gary Forsee told media outlets in 2005 that employees “shouldn’t expect to see a headline that there’s thousands of jobs that are going to be cut on the first of November or any time along the way.” By the end, more than 8,000 employees would lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OTOPMm"&gt;Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xre29K"&gt;T-Mobile’s other merger obligations, like helping Dish become a viable fourth carrier option, also seem like they might just be talk. Dish CEO Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;recently told the FCC&lt;/a&gt; that if T-Mobile moves forward with its plans to shut down its older 3G CDMA network, Dish’s Boost Mobile customers (who rely on Sprint’s network for service) would be greatly harmed. Ergen stresses that for customers who need the less expensive phone plans Boost provides, upgrading to a 4G or 5G-capable phone isn’t a small expense — it could force some people to go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AeidX3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dish chairman calls T-Mobile the ‘Grinch’ for going back on merger promises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5zarQA"&gt;As far as jobs are concerned, current T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert does tell the J&lt;em&gt;ournal&lt;/em&gt; that the company plans to fill 6,000 open positions as the world recovers from the pandemic. That might possibly bring T-Mobile/Sprint back up to its pre-merger numbers, but it’s now even harder to believe the company will add an additional 11,000 jobs by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H9k0m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung and Lenovo are the latest to ditch a physical Mobile World Congress</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLp3y9"&gt;Samsung and Lenovo representatives won’t show up in person to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year, according to statements obtained &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-will-attend-barcelonas-world-mobile-congress-remotely-la-vanguardia-2021-05-11/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSEF82"&gt;Samsung says it has “made the decision to withdraw from exhibiting in-person” and will instead attend remotely to prioritize the health and safety of its customers and employees.  A Lenovo spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company will attend virtually instead of in person and that it informed the GSM Association, which organizes the event, about its plans on Friday. Neither company has announced what its remote presence will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMKwuD"&gt;The in-person event is still scheduled to happen in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and difficulties with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421558/us-covid-coronavirus-vaccines-patent-waiver"&gt;vaccination availability outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. The GSMA also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;fought against shutting down last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; early on in 2020 before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;several big brands dropped out&lt;/a&gt;. This year, we’ve already seen Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;announce that it won’t be exhibiting&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to Samsung and Lenovo’s remote announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY6fwj"&gt;Other notable companies have dropped out from the in-person conference as well, including &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nokia-joins-ericsson-in-bailing-on-mwc-with-oracle-sony-also-reportedly-out-/d/d-id/767983"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/ericsson-bails-mwc-barcelona-2021"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwc-june-2021-barcelona-in-person-sony-nokia-ericsson-oracle-220004011.html"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.telecomtv.com/content/sustainability/what-s-up-with-oracle-mwc-orange-ofcom-5g-spectrum-apple-41023/"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2zZY"&gt;We’ve reached out to several other large brands about their attendance plans, including ZTE, and Huawei, which haven’t responded to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKhKfy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 11th, 5:21PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Lenovo confirmed to The Verge that it won’t attend MWC 2021 in person. Headline and copy have been updated to reflect. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KYNXb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 11th, 8:14PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added list of other companies that won’t be attending the conference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First commercial-scale offshore wind farm in the US gets federal approval</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deepwater wind farm off Block Island, Rhode Island" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5eZMW7zC2TxtJ0Ix994rCoxKzQ=/111x0:2079x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271108/1316070124.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pk70yU"&gt;The first commercial-scale offshore wind project in the US just got the green light from the Biden administration. The approval has the potential to dramatically grow the nation’s wind energy sector after years of regulatory limbo for proposed offshore projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="j5J9m0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big ambitions for offshore wind&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3g26hM"&gt;The Interior Department (DOI) granted the Vineyard Wind project permission to install up to 84 turbines off the coast of Massachusetts. Once completed, the project will be able to generate up to 800 megawatts (MW), enough electricity for 400,000 homes. That’s a dramatic scaling up of existing offshore wind capacity in the US. There are currently only two small developments off the East Coast and those can only&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;generate a combined 42 megawatts of electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyAgaj"&gt;The Biden administration has big ambitions for offshore wind. It set a goal of getting 30,000 MW of energy from offshore wind by 2030. That’s part of a bigger plan to tackle climate change by reaching 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWpmE4"&gt;“A clean energy future is within our grasp in the United States. The approval of this project is an important step toward advancing the Administration’s goals to create good-paying union jobs while combatting climate change and powering our nation,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UG0UF6"&gt;Europe is already ahead of the game, with more than &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271055/cumulative-european-offshore-wind-power-capacity-installations/#:~:text=Europe's%20cumulative%20offshore%20wind%20energy,European%20water%20bodies%20in%202006."&gt;25,000 MW&lt;/a&gt; of offshore wind capacity now. Globally, wind and solar energy are taking off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when it comes to electricity generation. New renewable energy capacity made up 90 percent of the global power sector’s growth in 2020 and is expected to do so again in 2021 and 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;according to a market update released today by the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CfKqK2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Globally, wind and solar energy are taking off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAPwlf"&gt;Vineyard Wind first submitted its construction and operations plan for federal approval in 2017, although plans for the project have been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2021/3/8/vineyard-wind-statement-on-release-of-final-environmental-impact-statement"&gt;since 2009&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the project has been greenlit, it’s expected to be operational by 2023, according to the project’s developers, Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQBApe"&gt;Vineyard Wind receiving a Record of Decision from the DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is likely a good sign for more than a dozen other offshore wind projects awaiting federal approval. It’s good news for adjacent industries, too, including shipbuilding.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There’s been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296979/us-offshore-ships-wind-boom-installation-vessels"&gt;“chicken and egg” situation for the offshore wind&lt;/a&gt; industry: it needs specialized vessels to construct new projects, but shipbuilders were hesitant to invest in new builds until major projects received permits to move forward. Vineyard Wind’s approval could be wind in the sails to get both industries really moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHfGpH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KaZAU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wyze Buds Pro offer ANC and wireless charging for $60</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2THXTRXH1oDMIAotYQGkvV7NCc=/233x0:2647x1609/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270980/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_12.25.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Rd4yA"&gt;Wyze, maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21726548/wyze-watch-44-47-smartwatch-price-release-date-features"&gt;$20 smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450637/wyze-headphones-video-doorbell-c-pricing-release-date"&gt;$30 video doorbells&lt;/a&gt;, has announced &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-buds-pro.html"&gt;a new pair of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that include active noise cancellation and a Qi wireless charging case for only $60 (&lt;a href="https://phandroid.com/2021/05/11/the-wyze-buds-pro-bring-active-noise-cancellation-and-alexa-for-just-60/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Phandroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). They’re called the Wyze Buds Pro and come in at an incredibly low price when compared to the competition: you could buy four pairs of these for the price of Apple’s AirPods Pro, which have similar features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAdheL"&gt;For comparison: &lt;a href="https://us.soundcore.com/collections/true-wireless/products/a3902"&gt;Anker’s $60 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; come without ANC or wireless charging (instead using Micro USB, where the Wyze buds also include a USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q41FQU"&gt;Wyze’s announcement video takes a decidedly self-aware bent, but while it does mention the sweat resistance, transparency mode, and wind noise reduction, it doesn’t mention one of the funniest things about the product’s name: it’s called “Pro,” but there aren’t any Wyze Buds non-pros to compare them against (though Wyze does &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WyzeCam/status/1392162656191016960?s=20"&gt;say a pair is coming&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3JR4r7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3TlUy8vC98?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CA2Mv"&gt;I may poke fun, but, on paper at least, these earbuds are competing way above their price. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;SoundCore Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; (what a name) from Anker and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WTWYS4?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds second-gen from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both considered to be budget picks for true-wireless earbuds with ANC, and those are in the $100+ price range. Amazon charges an extra $20 for a wireless charging case for the Echo Buds, something that Wyze includes. To add insult to injury for Amazon, the Wyze Buds Pro also have Alexa built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtoGrW"&gt;Of course, some of the most important functions of earbuds are how they sound and whether the ANC is actually any good. Given that we haven’t actually heard them yet, these earbuds haven’t proven themselves in either category. But if they end up being good, or even passable, they’ll be a solid deal for those who want all the fancy features without having to pay top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fo5qP1"&gt;The Wyze Buds Pro are currently available for preorder, and Wyze says they will start shipping in July.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will let people list their pronouns on their profiles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ndZt73ZoRkds_D0CTxw3OLQhxBU=/62x0:3494x2288/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270813/E1IBRk2VIAIoRO9.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CDSSxH"&gt;Instagram is making it easier to address people by their defined pronouns. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1392176784028749824/photo/1"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s allowing people to add up to four pronouns to their profile, which they can then choose to display publicly or only to their followers. (Users under 18 will have this setting turned on by default.) Instagram says people can &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/3827467694039713"&gt;fill out a form&lt;/a&gt; to have a pronoun added, if it’s not already available, or just add it to their bio instead. Instagram says this is available in a “few countries,” but doesn’t specify further. We’ve reached out for more information and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1rfrm"&gt;A couple &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers already have the pronouns setting available to them, suggesting it’s live in the US. You can get a better sense of the feature’s user flow in the screenshots below, courtesy of news writer Jay Peters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WENjqU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494820"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTSaLW"&gt;Other platforms also allow their users to add pronouns to their profiles. Dating apps, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17846054/okcupid-pronoun-options"&gt;OkCupid&lt;/a&gt;, have already introduced the feature, as have other apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18646740/lyft-pronoun-choice-app-lgbtq-pride"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, Facebook &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/facebook-gender-identity/"&gt;allowed users&lt;/a&gt; to define their pronouns starting in 2014, although the feature limited people to “he/him, she/her, and they/them.” This appears to still be the case while Instagram will offer more options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get a government-paid discount on your broadband </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0VSs6-nM67vX-UDEmnm0m0TOjPY=/0x0:945x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270446/EBB_Program_Social_Media_Post_Images_Option1_Telehealth1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gWCc31"&gt;The past year, a lot of people were laid off or otherwise unable to pay for basic necessities. So the &lt;a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf"&gt;stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; passed by Congress in December included a provision to pay for broadband and other basic tech for those who, because of job loss or other financial difficulties, can’t afford to pay for it on their own. And starting this week, if you qualify, you can take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kf2rdg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; is being administered by the FCC and offers a temporary discount on monthly broadband bills — up to $50 a month (or $75 if your household is on qualifying Tribal lands). If your income qualifies, you can also get a one-time discount of up to $100 for a computer or a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgqz9D"&gt;It’s not a lot, considering how much tech costs these days, but every little bit helps. And applications for that discount will be available starting tomorrow, May 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GCs6Bw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are a variety of ways you can qualify for the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ji2jm"&gt;There are a variety of ways &lt;a href="https://www.lifelinesupport.org/do-i-qualify/"&gt;you can qualify for the program&lt;/a&gt;. Qualifications can include your income level (at or below 135 percent of &lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/2021-poverty-guidelines"&gt;the Federal Poverty level&lt;/a&gt;), participation in a program such as SNAP or Medicaid, job loss due to the pandemic, or other criteria. You can get more information by either visiting the &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-faq-emergency-broadband-benefit"&gt;FCC website&lt;/a&gt; or by going to &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;getemergencybroadband.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDFd5I"&gt;If you think you qualify, you can either &lt;a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/"&gt;apply online&lt;/a&gt;, contact your current broadband provider to see if they are participating in the program (or &lt;a href="https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report"&gt;check this list for a provider near you&lt;/a&gt;), or print out and complete an application and send it to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kdkprs"&gt;Emergency Broadband Support Center&lt;br&gt;P.O. Box 7081&lt;br&gt;London, KY 40742.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yZoQ0N"&gt;One warning: if you think you may qualify, don’t put off sending in the application. This is a temporary program, and you lose your benefit when the fund runs out of money, or “six months after the Department of Health and Human Services declares an end to the COVID-19 health emergency” — whichever is sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vHraN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVhEO5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6QQ18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart tells entry-level team to return to office, senior managers can stay home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sizzling U.S. Stock Markets Await Next Leg Of Record IPO Run" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BNroc8ZGpF6XO6JhBzjplr0YqVs=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270427/1230448031.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnEVI3"&gt;Instacart is shifting to a primarily remote-first workplace, but employees say the company has arbitrarily chosen which teams have to come into the office in a way that hurts junior employees. Workers on the central operations team — which includes logistics and trust and safety — have been told they need to return to the San Francisco office three days a week starting in September and were not given a clear reason why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCt0jf"&gt;“To a lot of employees this policy excluding us from permanent remote work is being interpreted as ‘we trust the majority of the company to be able to work remote permanently, but not these specific employees,’” says one employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation. “Considering everyone has been remote for over a year, it’s very disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0pI2d"&gt;Last week, the company announced that 70 percent of the workforce would be remote. “We asked our employees what they wanted the future of work at Instacart to look like, their response? Make it flexible,” &lt;a href="https://instacart.careers/remote/"&gt;a newly updated careers page says&lt;/a&gt;. “We know there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for how we do our best work, so we’re introducing a hybrid work environment for when it’s safe for our offices to re-open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Am3K2H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not a matter of data security.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VqT6AN"&gt;Workers on central operations say they aren’t sure why they’re being required to come in. While companies like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;mandate in-office work for content moderators who handle sensitive information&lt;/a&gt;, Instacart is letting the central ops team work from home twice a week — and has allowed them to be fully remote for the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SO8JEd"&gt;In response to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Instacart spokesperson said: “Central Operations employees often work with sensitive proprietary information and data that is managed on-site in Instacart’s offices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXFSzU"&gt;The team, estimated to be around 100 people, includes many entry-level employees and workers who are new to the tech industry. Employees say the power imbalance makes it difficult to push back on the remote work policy. “A lot of the roles are easily replaceable,” says another worker who asked not to be named. “They can happily find someone else to fill that role if you’re not okay with the policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cH0Ihn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two commenters say they plan to quit if the policy doesn’t change.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EY0vuz"&gt;On the anonymous chat app Blind, one user wrote that managers on the central operations team were told to “silence the issue, when reported, rather than find a solution.” While anyone with an Instacart email address can post on Blind, the comment scared employees who worried they’d be fired if they questioned the mandate. Two commenters say they plan to quit if the policy doesn’t change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx1dkv"&gt;An Instacart spokesperson said it has never told managers to silence the remote work issue, adding: “We always encourage employee feedback on these policies and will continue to create forums for open discussion to ensure every Instacart employee feels engaged, productive, and successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lKV2d"&gt;In an internal email obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Instacart director said in-person work was a “foundational element to professional growth, team cohesion, cross-collaboration, and sustained performance over time.” But the requirement does not apply to most other teams at the company, nor does it extend to senior managers in the central operations organization. Those employees are able to work remotely, popping into the office a “percentage of time” throughout the month, according to the internal note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5jnzdh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter and Coinbase have committed to going fully remote.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1RM836"&gt;The tension between Instacart employees and management highlights the quandary that many tech companies will likely face as they begin to reopen their offices. While organizations like Twitter and Coinbase have committed to going fully remote, others are attempting a hybrid approach that will doubtless leave some workers frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lluyeB"&gt;That’s partly because many tech workers have moved outside of San Francisco. Natalie Holmes, a research fellow at the California Policy Lab, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-04/california-exodus-san-francisco-migration#:~:text=California-,Californians%20aren't%20leaving%20the%20state%20en%20masse%20%E2%80%94%20but%20they,from%20the%20California%20Policy%20Lab."&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the city was experiencing “a unique and dramatic exodus” amid the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPLGkQ"&gt;Instacart employees on the central operations team were already upset about having to return to in-person work three days a week when the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/05/06/instacart-remote-work-new-normal-office-hq.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Business Times &lt;/em&gt;published an article&lt;/a&gt; last week announcing most of the company would be remote. “The article put it in perspective that we were basically the only people who would be required in the office,” the anonymous employee says. “That threw the reason of ‘cross-collaboration’ out the window, since the teams we work with won’t be there.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Join Sen. Ed Markey and Gigi Sohn for a Verge Live event on Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qyCLMQFmHWgc62RPT2XrVpsD28A=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150086/VER_VergeLive_Article.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xu6vIF"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216843/georgia-runoff-net-neutrality-fcc-jon-ossoff-raphael-warnock-democrats-senate"&gt;the future looked bright for net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. After a surprise victory in the Georgia special elections, Democrats gained a majority in the Senate, opening the door for aggressive new Federal Communications Commission leadership that could reinstate net neutrality by regulatory order. There was even talk of passing a bill that would enshrine net neutrality in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3Eq4SG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDZaaI"&gt;In the three months since then, not much has happened. Preoccupied with the pandemic, the Biden White House has focused on shepherding through its relief and rebuilding efforts, a pair of massive spending bills that require every bit of political capital Democrats can spare. As a result, even basic measures like appointing a new FCC chair have taken a back seat to more urgent matters. But that may finally be changing, with rumblings from the FCC and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206984/net-neutrality-bill-congress-new-fcc-markey"&gt;poised to introduce a net neutrality bill in Congress in the months to come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOPafK"&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Live event on Wednesday, we’ll dive into the net neutrality fight and the broader progressive effort to upgrade America’s internet. With so much of Washington focused on infrastructure, there’s never been a better time to take stock of the broadband gap and the various ways the government can make sure America stays online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeG3qG"&gt;After a few opening words from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, we’ll have a conversation with Markey, talking through the path forward for net neutrality in this Congress. After that, we’ll talk to Georgetown fellow and Public Knowledge co-founder Gigi Sohn, who will get into what the next four years might hold for broadband access and broadband regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwNJf7"&gt;Just like our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287443/section-230-amy-klobuchar-internet-regulation-panel-event-sign-up"&gt;March event&lt;/a&gt;, the whole thing will be virtual, but you’ll be able to drop questions in a chat room if there’s anything you want to know. We won’t be posting the full video publicly, so the only way to see it is to &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/thevergeliveinfrastructure/article"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy NFTs on eBay, and ‘blockchain-driven collectibles’ are coming soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eBay new logo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5-AKBxepMJyBVVg1Jz2TqhrmJU=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69270085/ebay-logo-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5EcduJ"&gt;eBay is &lt;a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Announcements/eBay-and-Digital-Collectibles-Our-Tech-Led-Reimagination/ba-p/31861893"&gt;now allowing NFTs to be sold on its platform&lt;/a&gt;, making the digital collectibles available side by side with physical ones. Whether you’re looking for a physical Dogecoin replica or a digital representation of Elon Musk holding Doge, eBay is apparently now the place to get both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbYsR2"&gt;At the moment, eBay wants to make sure that NFTs are listed by trusted sellers, and only in certain categories like trading cards, music, entertainment, and art. The company does say, though, that it hopes to expand its policies and tools in the future to allow more categories after it’s gathered feedback from the community with the current crop of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FhvQEK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6PFVAV8enXMZMx_FW_wX35FhTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22507051/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_10.39.11_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first result when searching “NFT” on eBay, to the surprise of no one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVb6kn"&gt;The blog post also mentions future updates to allow “blockchain-driven collectables,” though it doesn’t expand on what that means outside of NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="745p04"&gt;eBay’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ebay-ceo-says-looking-cryptocurrency-payment-option-cnbc-2021-05-03"&gt;said earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that the company would be open to accepting cryptocurrencies in the future, but at the moment the NFTs being sold on the platform seem to be using its standard payment system linked to a credit card or PayPal account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZetzKt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel is the dream computer I’ll never own</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A laptop unlike any other&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7NjIfd"&gt;The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel is a computer I will never own. But I really, really wish I could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWRRPR"&gt;Artists, creators, and engineers who are looking for a powerful high-end convertible have all kinds of options on today’s market. But only Acer’s ConceptD line can fold in six different ways. There are not one, but two hinges attached to the display: a traditional clamshell hinge and another one in the middle of the lid that enables the screen to rotate outward. By using the two hinges in tandem, you can put the screen in nearly any position you want. This unique form factor makes the ConceptD 7 Ezel unlike any other laptop on the market.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j1LL6I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Acer’s Swift 5 puts the ‘ultra’ in ‘ultraportable’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"},{"title":"Acer Travelmate P6 review: a suitable business partner","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22339981/acer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="B9L2p0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10494201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDWr55"&gt;There are other things that separate the Ezel from something like a MacBook, of course. It also has a sleek look with an attractive finish, a gorgeous 15.6-inch 4K UHD touch display, a built-in Wacom EMR pen, and all the ports you need. The chips on the inside are quite powerful. But you can find similar benefits in many convertibles that are half the price. The people who should shell out thousands of dollars for this device are those who have a need for the combination of its unique form factor and large screen — and the rest of us can be jealous of them from afar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="tjtAjd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A sleek look with an attractive finish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2jTQt"&gt;Before ogling too much over this form factor, you might want to know how much it costs. The $2,499 base model comes with an Intel Core i7-10750H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. For $2,999.99, you can bump the graphics up to a GeForce RTX 2070 and 2TB of storage. I was sent the top model, which has a Core i7-10875H, 32GB of RAM, and a GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q, for a whopping $3,999.99. These components are both a generation old — Acer hasn’t refreshed the ConceptD with the latest chips yet — but they still deliver solid performance, as you’ll see later on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86DWnE"&gt;These prices will make the ConceptD 7 Ezel an unrealistic purchase for most people, but there’s a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fconceptd-models%2Flaptops%2Fconceptd3ezel&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22430445%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;14-inch ConceptD&lt;/a&gt; that’s more affordable if you’re interested in this form factor. For those whose work involves professional design and video editing, CGI, machine learning, and the like, Acer also sells a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fconceptd-model%2FNX.C5FAA.001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22430445%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro&lt;/a&gt; with an Nvidia Quadro GPU. Those are expensive, and people whose work requires a Quadro likely know who they are. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A normal-looking laptop, until you start bending the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oyxxQY"&gt;There are all kinds of ways you could theoretically arrange the ConceptD, but Acer has defined six. There’s Laptop (self-explanatory), Pad (tablet mode), Float (screen facing forward, hanging above the keyboard deck), Stand (screen facing forward, forming a tent shape over the keyboard deck), Share (screen facing upward, parallel to the keyboard deck), and Display (clamshell shape, but with the screen facing away from the keyboard). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J0Wtne"&gt;&lt;q&gt; The Ezel is too heavy to practically hold as a tablet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ewKJN"&gt;I started out using the Ezel in Laptop most of the time, but Float grew on me quickly. It brought the screen much closer to me — it’s pretty far away in Laptop mode, given the size of the keyboard deck. I can see the use cases for the other modes as well: I’d love to use Stand to take notes during a lecture, for example, and Share could be useful for drawing while standing at a desk. The one form I can’t really see myself using is Pad because, at 5.6 pounds, the Ezel is too heavy to practically hold as a tablet unless you’re swole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpE0tR"&gt;The one hiccup I ran into is that the screen is very top-heavy. A few times when I picked the device up, the screen would start to fall forward and I’d have to catch it to keep the lid open. My preferences for Windows tablet mode vs. Windows desktop mode also didn’t quite line up with the device’s. It stayed in desktop mode when in Stand, for example, but I’d prefer it switch to Tablet Mode in that form since the keyboard isn’t accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel in Float, seen from above and to the left. The screen displays several paintbrush strokes on a black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83JU3OCr0FGFNM4hIl4YGwEnneo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490295/akrales_20210503_4515_0093.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer calls this the “Ezel Hinge design.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGqHjx"&gt;The fact that these form factors are useful, of course, doesn’t mean that most people need&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;them. Convertibles like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; can emulate most of these positions as well (Float and Stand are the really unique ones). The Ezel is really meant for people who will be using the nontraditional forms a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. For those people, it has two main benefits: moving the screen around is quite smooth and seamless (you don’t have to use two hands to flip the whole machine around, as you would with a 2-in-1 workstation), and the hinge is also sturdy enough that you can draw in Float and Share with no wobble at all. Of course, this sturdiness comes with a big weight penalty, in addition to its price premium — the Ezel is much heavier than most convertible machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtv0fg"&gt;That extra heft isn’t for nothing — there are some serious fans in this device. Specifically, there are two “4th-Gen AeroBlade 3D” fans in addition to three heat pipes, and there are vents all over the place including the sides of the case and above the keyboard. The system (which Acer calls its “Vortex Flow” design) did a good job of keeping the chassis cool during my day-to-day work — the bottom sometimes got warm but was never uncomfortably hot, and I never felt much heat on the keyboard or palm rests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eZgG7S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10494211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QtZMfX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fans had trouble keeping pace with the CPU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sJRv6I"&gt;The fans had trouble keeping pace with the CPU, though. Temperatures stayed solidly in the mid-70s to mid-80s (Celsius) during a 30-minute loop of Cinebench — but throughout several runs of a five-minute, 33-second 4K video export in Adobe Premiere Pro, I saw it jump up to the mid-90s, and even high-90s often. Cinebench scores did decrease over time, and export times also got slower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpT8wf"&gt;The ConceptD took two minutes and 55 seconds to complete the video export, which is one of the fastest times we’ve ever seen from a laptop. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor and a GTX 1650 Ti took four minutes and 23 seconds (though different versions of Premiere Pro can impact export times, so synthetic benchmarks such as Cinebench are more precise for direct comparison). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o4hzxh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10494273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ylTifT"&gt;I also ran PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which measures a device’s performance on a number of real-world Premiere Pro tasks, and the ConceptD scored a 604, which beats the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=34962"&gt;XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; as well. The ConceptD also solidly beats the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/7749339"&gt;XPS&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/1335492"&gt;Geekbench 5&lt;/a&gt; across the board. The XPS isn’t exactly on a level playing field here, since it has a weaker GPU — these results just illustrate the increased performance that the ConceptD will give you for the extra money. Acer’s machine did lose to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; in both single-core tests, which underscores how powerful Apple’s processor is in single-core workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="AHAbIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10494222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpkcoE"&gt;The Ezel comes with some software features tailored to creative work as well. In Acer’s ConceptD Palette app, you can swap between Native and Adobe RGB color presets, as well as customizable profiles. You can also monitor CPU, GPU, and memory usage to see how much power your apps are using, and you can toggle between various split-screen layouts if you’re multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBTlyj"&gt;Acer says it’s worked with developers to “optimize” the device to work with various software including Premiere Pro, After Effects, Maya, Revit, and KeyShot. You could also run games on the ConceptD, but it wouldn’t be the best choice since the screen is just 60Hz and won’t be able to display very high frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Umlupg"&gt;As is often the case with big workstations, the Ezel’s battery life isn’t amazing. I averaged four hours and five minutes of continuous use with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s not unexpected, considering the high-resolution display and the discrete GPU, but it’s worth noting that you’ll probably need to bring the hefty brick with you if you’re taking the Ezel out and about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRo4dq"&gt;Elsewhere, the ConceptD 7 is a fine laptop to use. The keyboard is a bit flatter than I prefer but comfortable enough. The backlighting is a dark orange color (Acer calls it warm amber) that looks nice against the white deck. The touchpad is a bit small for a laptop of this size and I sometimes hit plastic while scrolling, but it is quite smooth. The chassis itself is a sturdy magnesium-aluminum alloy, and it’s covered in a nice white finish that Acer says is “highly resistant” to dirt and sun exposure. There’s a fingerprint reader built into the power button on the left side of the chassis, which works just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84c0Vp"&gt;I enjoyed using the built-in stylus, though it’s a bit stiff to pull out of its garage and requires a substantial nail. The pen uses Wacom EMR technology, meaning it never needs to be charged; it draws its power from inside the display. I enjoyed the limited drawing I was able to do on the smooth matte display (I’m an amateur artist at best). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel seen from the front on a desk. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gk8fzhPRyhtEW668QoMSirhtNM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490320/akrales_20210503_4515_0189.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pen lives on the right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f4vNtL"&gt;Acer says the ConceptD utilizes “improved psychoacoustics” to provide a better listening experience. You can swap between presets for music, voice, movies, and various types of games in the DTS:X Ultra app that comes preloaded if you have external speakers or headphones connected. If you’re using just the laptop, there are Music, Game, Movies, and Voice presets in ConceptD Palette. The dual front speakers themselves deliver not-great audio that’s quite lacking in the bass department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel with the screen floating backwards above the keyboard deck, seen from above.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you want to switch to tablet mode?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fg3Kip"&gt;The ConceptD 7 Ezel is… well, in a word, it’s awesome. But you don’t need me to tell you that you don’t need to spend $4,000 to get an awesome device. If you want a touchscreen convertible with stylus support and can live without quite this much processing power, devices like the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Fenvy---omen%2Fhp-spectre-x360-15-3074457345617433669--1%23%21%26tab%3Dvao&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22430445%2Facer-conceptd-7-ezel-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Spectre x360 15&lt;/a&gt; are half the price of this device, more portable, and also have outstanding screens. The Spectre’s screen doesn’t literally fold over the keyboard, but it’ll work for many of the same use cases. And even for those who want this particular form factor, the smaller ConceptD 3 Ezel will be a more practical purchase. The ConceptD 7 Ezel is for those who need serious power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ZV4A2H"&gt;But man, is the ConceptD 7 Ezel a great device for content creators. As a professional reviewer, I’ve used more creator-focused laptops than most people on the planet — and I’ve never used anything like this. It’s a great idea, it’s powerful, it’s well-built, and it’s a lot of fun to use. I won’t recommend that you buy it — but if you do, please know that I’m very jealous of you. &lt;/p&gt;
