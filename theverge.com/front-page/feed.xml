    <title>Telegram’s group video calls can now have up to 1,000 viewers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sL4whk"&gt;Telegram has announced &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;the latest new features and improvements&lt;/a&gt; making their way to the popular messaging app. Video is the focus this time around. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat"&gt;launching group video calls last month&lt;/a&gt;, those sessions are now able to tally up to 1,000 viewers. The maximum number of people able to participate and broadcast to the video call remains at 30, but you can have quite the audience now for “anything from online lectures to live rap battles,” according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYioAW"&gt;Video messages will also now come through at a higher resolution, and you can tap them for a larger view of the clip. When recording your own video messages, Telegram says that audio from your device will now keep playing as you do so, “so you can now sing along to your favorite songs or reply without pausing your podcast.” You can now zoom in when recording with your phone’s rear camera, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cr7RLM"&gt;Other additions include screen sharing for one-on-one video calls (with audio from the device of whoever’s broadcasting), the option to auto-delete messages after a month — the longest option &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301393/telegram-auto-delete-messages-widgets-andoird-ios-update"&gt;was previously a week&lt;/a&gt; — and more precise drawing. Telegram has also spruced up the user experience with animations for the passcode screen and when you send messages on Android; iOS users already got these message animations in a previous update. For the full list of changes, head over to &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000"&gt;Telegram’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>K-pop’s fandom platforms are changing what it means to be an idol</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lsCxyBrHQ7kvucqQYFMCy9KkK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69660335/VRG_4679_KPOP_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Digital fan clubs are turning into single-purpose social networks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="8AEgCl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Pc6nDb"&gt;Fandom has changed a lot since I was a kid. As a tween, I had no hope of getting in touch with celebrities I adored like Britney Spears and Whitney Houston. Now, I’ve not only spoken with some of my celebrity favorites on social media, but I’ve even fought with a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UhspD"&gt;The technology of fandom is changing, too. Parasocial relationships — a largely one-sided relationship between a fan and a public figure they feel close to due to social media — are everywhere online. And the companies behind some of the biggest acts in K-pop are pioneering a new way to monetize them. They’ve developed online platforms to help K-pop fans feel as though they have direct access to their idol favorites. That access helps shape the way these fans interact with the idol as a form of friendship &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how they engage with other fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UHHumY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three main platforms now stand out: Universe, Weverse, and LYSN&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYQ8AO"&gt;Before the rise of social media accounts and company-run platforms, most fans for Korean artists basically were locked into direct engagement through &lt;a href="http://www.thekrazemagazine.com/latest-updates/2020/3/15/fancafes-and-why-they-are-such-a-headache"&gt;fancafes&lt;/a&gt; — a kind of digital fan club that often required fans to prove their knowledge of a particular artist before gaining access to artists. Initially hosted on platforms like social networking site &lt;a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/DaumCafe?lang=en"&gt;DAUM&lt;/a&gt;, these fancafes allowed fans to connect with idols directly, and they could become even more intimate when connected with the official paid fan club memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar0Ejm"&gt;While the DAUM fancafes for many idols are still up and running, there has been a shift away from them over the past two years, especially for English-language fandoms. In their place, several companies have created new social apps for their artists, entirely bypassing third-party platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Three main platforms now stand out: NCSoft’s Universe is used by a wide range of groups managed by companies outside of the &lt;a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2021/03/30/entertainment/kpop/SM-entertainment-JYP-entertainment-YG-entertainment/20210330160916443.html"&gt;Big Four&lt;/a&gt; of Korean pop music and includes features like a “private messaging” service, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/3/22311645/deepfake-ai-k-pop-stars-ncsoft-universe-music-industry"&gt;exclusive music&lt;/a&gt;, and mildly controversial AI-generated voice calls with idols. HYBE’s Weverse is home to mega-groups like BTS and TXT and structured more like the DAUM fancafes. Finally, there’s SM’s LYSN, which includes the truly innovative Bubble app that has found a way to give K-pop groups all of the benefits of Twitter DMs, without many of the problems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbTsFt"&gt;SM is a K-pop-producing powerhouse behind groups like TVXQ and the cyberpunk girl group Aespa. Its platform, LYSN, first launched in 2018 as an “interest-based fan community.” It was a relative failure before the 2020 introduction of its Bubble&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;idol instant messaging service, which &lt;a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/news/heres-much-money-sm-entertainment-made-fans-application-lysn-bubble/"&gt;kicked profits into the stratosphere&lt;/a&gt;. With the different versions of Bubble, fans can contact their favorite idols through partially private messaging, paid for on a subscription basis. The app is designed to look like a one-on-one chat window, but the reality is more like a massive group chat, with the idol &lt;a href="http://www.lysn.com/en_US/faq/21129452"&gt;dropping in messages for thousands of fans at once&lt;/a&gt; and seeing replies as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TC99md"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It can feel like you are receiving a personal, private message from the idol.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEIqr5"&gt;Areum Jeong, assistant professor of humanities at Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute, says the apps offer fans a real chance to strengthen their relationship with their current favorite idols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpO5ij"&gt;“Fans are fully aware that it is technically a group chat where the idol will receive messages from thousands of fans, although fans cannot see the other fans’ messages,” says Jeong. “Even so, fans enjoy receiving messages where the idol shares his / her daily life and thoughts. And at times, it can feel like you are receiving a personal, private message from the idol because the interface gives an illusion of a 1:1 chat, and some idols will send messages that cater to intimate feelings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjjGZy"&gt;That faux-intimacy can be a powerful force for fans who use these platforms regularly. “I like using Weverse specifically because I love seeing member interactions in a seemingly authentic way,” says Leigh, a fan of idol group Seventeen who connects with the group through Weverse. “It is fun to see members in basically a glorified group chat that, from time to time, it feels like I am an observer of, but most of the time, I feel like I am a participant in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="P6PStU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The relationship between BTS and ARMY never feels one-sided.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lqhl0O"&gt;Part of the appeal is that fans can feel as though they’re seeing a different, more personal side to the idol they’re following on less direct platforms like Twitter or Instagram. For Nicole Santero, a PhD student currently doing research on the culture on BTS’s massive international fan base ARMY (and who runs &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ResearchBTS"&gt;the @ResearchBTS Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;), it’s all about the connections that fans can make in their interactions with the artists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLciOV"&gt;“The relationship between BTS and ARMY never feels one-sided. What has stood out about Weverse is how BTS is so active and often responds directly to fans on the app,” says Santero. “That makes Weverse even more appealing, and there is definitely this greater intimacy and closeness formed between artists and fans through these types of interactions. Knowing that BTS could potentially see your posts makes the experience even more meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3DEvw"&gt;These company-run apps don’t just offer fans the ability to receive comfort from the artist. For some fans, the appeal is in getting to offer support when an artist is going through a health issue, a scandal, or simply when they’re bored on their rare downtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbSC3Z"&gt;For Maxim, an Australian Stray Kids fan who’s been using the Bubble app for six months, it’s been a mix of good times and bad times. “The Great Hyunjin Incident of ’21 was a bit of a tumultuous time for that whole band / fandom, and I do admit that I sent a little buck-up message of encouragement through to Felix,” he said, referring to group member Felix. “Other times, I’ve replied to messages when Felix asks for recommendations and try to sneak my taste onto his agenda. Again, there’s genuinely no way to know if he ever sees it. Would he even watch &lt;em&gt;Yuri on Ice&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sk8 the Infinity&lt;/em&gt;?” (I think he probably would.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Ujjd"&gt;Unlike past fan clubs for other celebrities, there’s no guarantee that what happens on company-run apps will stay on those apps. In fact, due to the medium to low quality of in-app translation services to translate from Korean to English, there are &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tamarherman/2020/08/20/the-unpaid-labor-of-k-pop-fan-translation-twitter/"&gt;translation accounts&lt;/a&gt; for many of the artists across these platforms that focus exclusively on Weverse / LYSN and Bubble / Universe. If an idol’s fan base is small or poorly organized outside of the company-run platform, they may have fewer translation accounts. However, that doesn’t stop fans from sharing memes, artist-uploaded selfies, and clips from livestreams everywhere that they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PxWf9"&gt;There can be a hard edge to that intimacy. “As more fans than ever view themselves as active consumers, they can be unreasonable or even hostile,” says Jeong. Fans of rookie idol group Enhypen have been &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/k-pop-group-enhypen-fandom-racism"&gt;dealing with a fractured fandom&lt;/a&gt; following a member potentially saying the n-word, and much of the conflict between fans stems from interactions on Weverse. Fans on the platform tried to hide violent and racist posts from the artist using an in-app feature for inter-fan communication and ended up attacking Black fans speaking out about the incident and then about the harassment they were facing. Within hours of the initial wave of harassment, Black fans of the group took to Twitter and TikTok to share what they were seeing and how people were talking about them — especially in the face of continued silence from the group, their management, and Weverse moderation. The app they’d been using to connect with other fans and the idols themselves was no longer the safe space it had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6od9Rm"&gt;Still, none of these engagements would have been easy 10 years ago, and most would have been flat-out impossible 10 years before that. These platforms offer an entirely new way for celebrities and their fans to interact, building on conventional social media platforms but increasingly distinct from them. And for better or worse, it’s changing what it means to be a fan — or an idol — online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd1sTZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tc9A40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You might want to avoid the gobs of Halo Infinite spoilers Microsoft just leaked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JvSqgRyyr1wHNYz5sTHMpSMzU0=/9x0:1805x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659239/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jjNZiO"&gt;If you’re invested in the story of Master Chief, Cortana, and the fate of the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe, you might want to keep your head down and start muting some keywords on social media until &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;arrives later this year — because vast spoilers for the game’s entire story are now floating around on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15LuYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: we’ll be keeping this post spoiler-free, though&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCXB8a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; creative director Joseph Staten &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joestaten?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1421244308766674947%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F30%2F22602811%2Fhalo-infinite-story-spoiler-leak-cortana-technical-preview"&gt;confirmed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft accidentally leaked “a small number of Halo Infinite campaign files” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597498/halo-infinite-multiplayer-technical-preview-beta-july-29th"&gt;when it launched the game’s first multiplayer beta yesterday on July 29th&lt;/a&gt;, saying they “can ruin the campaign experience for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xn4x6X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Leaks like this are painful for the dev team and can ruin the campaign experience for everyone. So please, keep you eyes peeled for spoilers and don't spread them if you see them.❤️ 2/2&lt;/p&gt;— Joseph Staten (@joestaten) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joestaten/status/1421244308766674947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykslJx"&gt;As far as we can tell, that’s no exaggeration — we found a plaintext dump on the web with over 800 strings of text that appear to be from &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign. They seem to describe both your in-game objectives, and basic descriptions of the plot, all the way through the end of the story. (At least one of them literally describes a plot twist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gcSJB"&gt;We’re not linking to the strings, though they’re not terribly hard to find if you really want to spoil the campaign. But if, instead, you’re trying to keep spoilers away, might we suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144097/twitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to-settings-phone-desktop"&gt;our guide on how to mute words on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o25dBQ"&gt;In lighter &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; news, developer 343 Industries recently revealed &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-has-drop-weapon-button-so-dont-kill-me-t-1847386144"&gt;you’ll finally have a “drop weapon” button&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully leading to fewer randos teamkilling you just to claim your sniper rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the latest accusations Activision Blizzard employees have leveled at the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HBIMFsryuO-8F5cJ03oFUxahr68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659148/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SvzE3g"&gt;More disturbing allegations of Activision Blizzard’s reported culture of sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination have been reported in recent days, following a huge lawsuit filed against the company by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883FDU"&gt;Details in these stories may be challenging to read, so we are prefacing them with &lt;strong&gt;a content warning for descriptions of sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdUGx3"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/activision-walkout-metoo-call-of-duty.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; posted a story&lt;/a&gt; of extremely distressing accounts of Activision Blizzard’s culture. Here is one from Shay Stein, a former customer service employee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rV3iMZ"&gt;Ms. Stein, 28, who worked at Activision from 2014 to 2017 in a customer service role, helping gamers with problems and glitches, said she had consistently been paid less than her ex-boyfriend, who joined the company at the same time she did and performed the same work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elkVBU"&gt;Ms. Stein said she had once declined drugs that her manager offered at a holiday party in 2014 or 2015, which soured their relationship and hampered her career. In 2016, a manager messaged her on Facebook, suggesting she must be into “some freaky stuff” and asking what type of pornography she watched. She said she had also overheard male colleagues joking that some women had their jobs only because they performed sexual favors for male superiors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RanNHC"&gt;And former vice president Lisa Welch shared an account of how an exec asked her to have sex with him “because she ‘deserved to have some fun’ after her boyfriend had died weeks earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxc9uQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aq4vv/blizzard-recruiters-asked-hacker-if-she-liked-being-penetrated-at-job-fair"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; published a disturbing report&lt;/a&gt; on Friday about the story of Emily Mitchell, a security researcher, who approached Blizzard’s booth at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in 2015 and was harassed by Blizzard’s representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VPAjvq"&gt;When she got to the table, she said she asked about the penetration testing position. Penetration testing, or pentesting, is the industry term for a security audit. Mitchell said she was wearing a t-shirt made by cybersecurity company SecureState, which had “Penetration Expert” on the front. One of the Blizzard employees first asked if she was lost, another one asked if she was at the conference with her boyfriend, and another one asked if she even knew what pentesting was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B315Gt"&gt;“One of them asked me when was the last time I was personally penetrated, if I liked being penetrated, and how often I got penetrated,” Mitchell told Waypoint. “I was furious and felt humiliated so I took the free swag and left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wcBAp4"&gt;Mitchell would later work as the COO at a company called Sagitta HPC (now Terahash), and when Blizzard wanted to hire the company in 2017, she reported the incident to founder and CEO Jeremi Gosney, according to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;. Gosney posted his redacted email reply &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/839727489635209216"&gt;on Twitter in March 2017&lt;/a&gt;, demanding that Blizzard fulfill several conditions if they were to work together, including a “50 percent misogyny tax” where the proceeds would be donated to three charities supporting women in technology, and that Blizzard send a letter of apology to Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VqI6Yn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not going to name-and-shame, but "Don't Be a Dick" is globally applicable. There are repercussions. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenintech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#womenintech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternationalWomensDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#InternationalWomensDay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Wcds3a2bnA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Wcds3a2bnA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeremi M. Gosney (@jmgosney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/839727489635209216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVbwuO"&gt;Gosney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/1421225449351430145"&gt;confirmed Friday&lt;/a&gt; that the redacted name in the email was Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHUS8T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-activision-blizzards-week-of-reckoning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; posted a big feature&lt;/a&gt; Friday detailing enormous challenges women have faced at Activision Blizzard. One harrowing example: men would walk into breastfeeding rooms, because at one point they didn’t have locks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="75wl28"&gt;A source who has since departed Blizzard talked about how the room designated for breastfeeding didn’t have locks. “Men would walk into the breastfeeding room. There was no way to lock the door. They would just stare and I would have to scream at them to leave.” IGN understands that breastfeeding rooms have since been updated, with locks added to doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wbg0Mw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN’s&lt;/em&gt; article also added further detail to the allegation in the DFEH’s lawsuit that working at the company was “akin to working in a frat house:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KV3h5Y"&gt;Such stories abound at Activision Blizzard, compounded by a drinking culture that until recently was “insane,” a source said. One woman told me she “doggedly avoided” drinking events on campus because of their reputation. Another talked about how it was “much more sexual” in Blizzard’s main office in Irvine circa 2015, with women being subjected to inappropriate touching in the chest area and elsewhere, “sometimes at the holiday party, sometimes not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uko3mB"&gt;Activision Blizzard has taken steps to attempt to address the problematic drinking culture by introducing a two drink maximum at company events, according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, a policy that was put in place in 2018, a company spokesperson told the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvJY8e"&gt;On Wednesday, Activision Blizzard employees walked out in protest of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;company’s handling of the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Employees had signed a letter Monday&lt;/a&gt; slamming the company’s initial response. A day later, CEO Bobby Kotick attempted to address the allegations and concerns ahead of the planned walkout, calling Activision Blizzard’s response “tone deaf” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;in a public letter&lt;/a&gt;. Just before the walkout, employees responded to Kotick’s letter in turn, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;saying that it&lt;/a&gt; “fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLJg1h"&gt;In a small positive step, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League, which is owned by Activision Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/overwatchleague/status/1421183813221109760"&gt;committed Friday to donating to “worthy causes.”&lt;/a&gt; But the league took that step after &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League teams the Washington Justice and the Houston Outlaws jointly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/washjustice/status/1420851121833320450"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Outlaws/status/1420851140422426624"&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; they would be donating to RAINN and Big Sister Little Sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Qy4ka"&gt;

    <title>After accusations, Twitter will pay hackers to find biases in its automatic image crops  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQp_ZzJR2pggc740UT7tRDi6ITA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659119/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3zSi5"&gt;Twitter is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/algorithmic-bias-bounty-challenge"&gt;holding a competition&lt;/a&gt; in hopes that hackers and researchers will be able to identify biases in its image cropping algorithm — and it’s going to be handing out cash prizes to winning teams (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bug-bounty-contest-algorithm-bias-image-cropping-185634779.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Twitter is hoping that giving teams access to its code and image cropping model will let them find ways that the algorithm could be harmful (such as it cropping in a way that stereotypes or erases the image’s subject).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXbxoN"&gt;Those competing will &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter-algorithmic-bias"&gt;have to submit a description of their findings&lt;/a&gt;, and a dataset that can be run through the algorithm to demonstrate the issue. Twitter will then assign points based on what kind of harms are found, how much it could potentially affect people, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcfeXl"&gt;The winning team will be awarded $3,500, and there are separate $1,000 prizes for the most innovative and most generalizable findings. That amount &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1421174066849931265"&gt;has caused a bit of a stir&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, with a few users saying it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m/status/1421179586813960192?s=20"&gt;should have an extra zero&lt;/a&gt;. For context, Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter?type=team"&gt;normal bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; would pay you $2,940 if you found a bug that let you perform actions for someone else (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5800370/tweetdeck-vulnerability-lets-attackers-execute-code-remotely"&gt;retweeting a tweet or image&lt;/a&gt;) using cross-site scripting. Finding an OAuth issue that lets you take over someone’s Twitter account would net you $7,700. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UX44mR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A competition lets Twitter get feedback from a much broader range of perspectives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xU7J3v"&gt;Twitter has done its own research into its image-cropping algorithm before — in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444372/twitter-image-crop-racial-gender-bias-research"&gt;it published a paper&lt;/a&gt; investigating how the algorithm was biased, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;accusations that its previews crops were racist&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;mostly done away with&lt;/a&gt; algorithmically cropping previews since then, but it’s still used on desktop and a good cropping algorithm is a handy thing for a company like Twitter to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B4n0G"&gt;Opening up a competition lets Twitter get feedback from a much broader range of perspectives. For example, the Twitter team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ruchowdh/status/1420820892398014464?s=20"&gt;held a space&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the competition during which a team member mentioned getting questions about caste-based biases in the algorithm, something that may not be noticeable to software developers in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IL8DDD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter is also looking for ways its algorithm could be exploited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SOPLMv"&gt;It’s also not just subconscious algorithmic bias Twitter is looking for. The rubric has point values for both intentional and unintentional harms. Twitter defines unintentional harms as crops that could result from a “well-intentioned” user posting a regular image on the platform, whereas intentional harms are problematic cropping behaviors that could be exploited by someone posting maliciously designed images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MZGBA"&gt;Twitter says in its announcement blog that the competition is separate from &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter?type=team"&gt;its bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; — if you submit a report about algorithmic biases to Twitter outside of the competition, the company says your report will be closed and marked as not applicable. If you’re interested in joining, you can &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter-algorithmic-bias"&gt;head over to the competition’s HackerOne page&lt;/a&gt; to see the rules, criteria, and more. Submissions are open until August 6th at 11:59PM PT, and the winners of the challenge will be announced at the Def Con AI Village on August 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastodon now has an official iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UuqtDryL8A5gdJtWPwW5ae3Yd54=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658958/mastodon.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucykbC"&gt;Decentralized social network Mastodon now has an official iPhone app. The nonprofit behind Mastodon &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974"&gt;launched the app&lt;/a&gt; on iOS today, supplementing an existing web version and several &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps"&gt;third-party apps&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, Android, and other platforms. The app is free and offers a similar feature set to Mastodon’s core service, although it doesn’t include Mastodon’s broad local and federated timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtPWX7"&gt;Mastodon describes the app as particularly geared toward getting new users on board the nontraditional social platform. As we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use"&gt;outlined before&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon looks similar to Twitter but is built around &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities"&gt;independently run communities&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="https://activitypub.rocks/"&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; protocol) rather than a single central network. You can create your account on a community of your choice while following and messaging people in other communities as well. It’s an unusual design among modern social platforms, and offering an official iOS entry point could help ease people into it more smoothly. CEO Eugen Rochko confirmed plans for a comparable Android app, but there’s no timeline for releasing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDrL1W"&gt;Mastodon’s iOS app supports features like polls and sensitive content filters, and the app page subtly highlights its differences with bigger services like Twitter by mentioning Mastodon’s “ad-free, chronological timeline.” As mentioned above, however, you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; find a section for local and federated timelines — Mastodon’s firehose of all public posts from your home community and the communities of people linked with it, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcDHdT"&gt;Rochko tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that those timelines were a “suboptimal” way to discover new content, and excluding them also reduced the potential for conflict with Apple, which has required some social networks to limit what users can find through their apps. (Reddit’s iOS app, for instance, makes you opt into NSFW content through the web.) For a different feature set, you can keep using one of the existing iOS apps — or just log in through the web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Tesla Megapack burst into flames at ‘Victorian Big Battery’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A rendering of the “Victorian Big Battery.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9ran_NXmsSFkbvZS5RfpF3IXME=/1x0:1999x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658426/VBB_Our_Battery.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rendering of what the “Victorian Big Battery” will look like when completed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Neoen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRoUZL"&gt;A Tesla Megapack &lt;a href="https://victorianbigbattery.com.au/incident-at-vbb/"&gt;caught fire&lt;/a&gt; today during initial testing of a highly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551342/australia-power-grid-victorian-big-battery"&gt;anticipated new utility-scale battery&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria, Australia. Luckily, there were no injuries or disruptions to the local electricity supply, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/07/30/tesla-megapack-caught-fire-at-victorian-big-battery-site-in-australia.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; reports. The blaze posed no risk of spreading to the nearby community, according to &lt;a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/fire-erupts-at-tesla-big-battery-in-australia-during-testing?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it did trigger a toxic smoke warning for residents who were told to stay indoors, the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/fire-breaks-out-during-testing-of-victorian-big-battery-near-geelong-20210730-p58eh4.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The cause of the fire is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KZTrBh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;JUST IN: Fire crews are currently on the scene of a battery fire at Moorabool, near Geelong. Firefighters are working to contain the fire and stop it spreading to the nearby batteries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3"&gt;https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/7NEWS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#7NEWS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HAkFY27JgQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HAkFY27JgQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 7NEWS Melbourne (@7NewsMelbourne) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/7NewsMelbourne/status/1420932114296446987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jczpWD"&gt;The fire affected the aptly named “Victorian Big Battery.” Spanning an area nearly as big as a football stadium, it’s one of the largest in the world. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.neoen.com/var/fichiers/2021-02-25-media-release-vbb-fc.pdf"&gt;scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to be operational by the end of this year, and the 300MW battery should be able to store enough energy to power more than a million homes in Victoria for half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Up7O"&gt;That’s supposed to help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-26/victorian-blackouts-what-caused-them-and-is-this-the-new-normal/10751412"&gt;blackouts&lt;/a&gt; that have affected hundreds of thousands of homes in the region in recent years, especially in the summer when demand for electricity spikes. Giant batteries are also crucial to meeting environmental and renewable energy goals. The state of Victoria aims to get half of its electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar power by 2030. Batteries can fill in the gaps in energy supply when the sun doesn’t shine and winds don’t blow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbcP7l"&gt;French renewable energy company Neoen is developing the Victorian Big Battery alongside Tesla and energy company AusNet Services. Neoen and Tesla brought another grid-scale battery online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/1/16723186/elon-musk-battery-launched-south-australia"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which was the largest lithium-ion battery in the world at the time.  Neoen did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYy7vf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: this quarter’s earnings for Apple, Samsung, Google, and Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNu3A0"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eR9GXx"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay and Dieter bring back &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;managing editor Alex Cranz and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg to chat about the headlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAzEz0"&gt;It’s earnings week once again. Unsurprisingly, all of the big tech companies made a lot of money this past quarter. Our podcast crew dives into the numbers behind the profits of Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon, and Apple and what it means for each business’s future goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq9qnE"&gt;The show also dedicates some time to discuss Intel’s business. Chaim leads the discussion after writing a story about Intel’s worst summer last year and how it’s been fighting its way back since then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>June heatwave was the ‘most extreme’ on record for North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fires in Lytton, British Columbia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OGjpyoSwIcznEVGPYfXzTOnoos8=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657783/1233843473.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2HksXk"&gt;The devastating heatwave that struck the Northwest US and southwest Canada in June was “the most extreme summer heatwave” ever recorded in North America, according to a new &lt;a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/june-2021-temperature-update/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from nonprofit research group Berkeley Earth. That’s based on the magnitude of the heatwave, or how much warmer it was than normal. Record temperatures in the region reached roughly 20 degrees Celsius (or 36 °F) hotter than average in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Km4B"&gt;Canada recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/30/canada-record-heat-experts-react/"&gt;hottest temperature ever&lt;/a&gt; on June 29th when the village of Lytton in British Columbia reached an astonishing 49.6 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit). Typical temperatures there in June are closer to 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OcqjHk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vuyuqh"&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering. Scorching temperatures fed wildfires, which burned down &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/americas/canada-lytton-wildfire-climate-change-indigenous-intl-cmd/index.html"&gt;90 percent of Lytton&lt;/a&gt;. There were at least &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-heat-dome-sudden-deaths-570-1.6122316"&gt;570 heat-related deaths in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and at least &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/08/pacific-northwest-heatwave-deaths#:~:text=Record%2Dbreaking%20US%20Pacific%20north%2Dwest%20heatwave%20killed%20almost%20200%20people,-Officials%20reported%20116&amp;amp;text=The%20death%20toll%20from%20the,and%2078%20in%20Washington%20state."&gt;194 in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands more people wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;in emergency departments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mz8ei1"&gt;The late June heatwave was a “1,000-year event…hopefully,” according to a preliminary &lt;a href="https://climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/preliminary-analysis-concludes-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-was-1000-year"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The severity of the heat would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change, both NOAA and a separate &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from an international team of researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__gejqvpocyna"&gt;For the entire Northern Hemisphere, it was the warmest June on record averaged across all land areas. Nearly 4 percent of the surface of the Earth hit record high average temperatures during the first half of 2021, according to the Berkeley Earth analysis. That’s despite the cooling effect of a La Niña event. Looking at the first six months of the year, “Nowhere has been record cold,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1421131167210819599"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Berkeley Earth lead scientist Robert Rohde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7c6MKA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuja40"&gt;Globally, the odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves like the one that took such a huge toll in the US and Canada in June are likely on the rise. Prolonged, record-breaking extreme heat events are two to seven times more likely to take place from now until 2050 compared to the previous three decades, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this week. That estimate is based on a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions stay high, like they are today. There’s still some hope of avoiding that future — but first, humanity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522736/carbon-dioxide-co2-record-climate-change"&gt;will have to stop burning&lt;/a&gt; quite so many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘May be an image’: what it’s like browsing Instagram while blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animation of a blank Instagram post on the left emitting an audio waveform that breaks apart before reaching an ear on the right." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/znhhRhwoXG3kuYzwCPkZfgBYjcU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657662/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The ridiculous sounds of social sites&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WWfjrj"&gt;Using a screen reader to navigate Instagram, as some people with low vision do, is a strange patchwork of sounds. It can be overwhelming, especially if you’re used to quickly scanning information with your eyes, to hear a synthetic voice clunkily rattle off usernames, timestamps, and like counts as though they’re all equally important as the actual content of the post. Among all that auditory stimulation, if someone added alt text to their photo, you might hear something like “John and I standing with our ankles in the water at the beach. John is making a distressed face while I menacingly hold out a dead crab and laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTXr2N"&gt;The image descriptions used by screen readers have to be added by users, and like many accessibility features in social media, those fields are regularly neglected. In those cases, the voice will sometimes recite alt text that Instagram or the user’s device generates automatically. The result, Danielle McCann, the social media coordinator for the National Federation of the Blind, tells me, can be pretty funny. The descriptions that have evolved from &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/how-facebook-is-using-ai-to-improve-photo-descriptions-for-people-who-are-blind-or-visually-impaired/"&gt;years of machine learning&lt;/a&gt; still often misidentify what’s happening in photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDNI3j"&gt;Recently, she was scrolling through Instagram when her screen reader said there was a photo of “two brown cats lying on a textured surface.” Her husband informed her that it was actually a bridal shop ad featuring a woman in a wedding dress. “Thank goodness I wasn’t [commenting] like, ‘Oh those cats are cute,’ you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUS7yR"&gt;These kinds of algorithmic misinterpretations are pretty common. Here’s a sampling of descriptions I heard while I browsed Instagram with VoiceOver on my phone: “red polo, apple, unicorn” (a photo of a T-shirt with a drawing of a couch on it), “may be an image of indoor” (a photo of a cat next to a house plant), “may be an image of food” (a photo of sea shells), “may be a cartoon” (almost every illustration or comic panel), and a whole lot of “may be an image of one person” (a variety of photos featuring one or more people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyubbx"&gt;As devices have gained accessibility settings like magnification, high contrast, and built-in screen readers, social media has also slowly become more accessible for people who are blind or have low vision: many sites and apps respond to users’ device settings, have options to toggle light and dark modes, and enable users to compose image descriptions. But the existence of those features doesn’t guarantee people with disabilities won’t be excluded online. Social media accessibility is a group effort. People have to know about the features, understand what they are, and actually remember to use them. A platform can have a hundred accessibility options, but without buy-in from every user, people are still left out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXy3xP"&gt;Even when people use alt text, they often don’t fully think through what’s important to convey to someone who can’t see photos. Some people will write overly simplistic descriptions like “red flower” or “blonde girl looking at sky,” without actually describing what it is about the images that makes them worth sharing. At the other end, multiple paragraphs of text to describe one image can be annoying to navigate with a screen reader. McCann tells friends to think of alt text as a writing exercise: “How do you provide as much information in as few words as possible?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K67Hzr"&gt;“The general rule is to be informative, not poetic,” says the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). “But on social media, feel free to add some personality — you’re probably sharing that picture of your dog because he has a hilarious quizzical expression, for example, not because he is a black-and-white pitbull mix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcv144"&gt;While automated image descriptions might eventually improve beyond the level of mistaking a woman in a wedding dress for some cats, they can’t replace the human element. Facebook had an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681231/facebook-outage-image-tags-captions-ai-machine-learning-revealed"&gt;image outage&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that showed all of its users the photo tags that are usually hidden, displaying machine-assigned descriptors like “Image may contain: people standing.” Are the people contained in that image embracing and making goofy faces? Are they standing in front of a breathtaking vista? Social media can feel a lot less social if your access to the content shared within it relies on computers’ conservative interpretations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKvMyR"&gt;Advocates stress that accessibility should always be a consideration from the start, “not as an add-on to an already-existing platform well after the fact,” says AFB. But most popular platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, didn’t take that route during initial development, and are instead constantly playing catch-up to improve their accessibility. When those improvements roll out, it’s never guaranteed that people will consistently use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kwIby5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nuEW73"&gt;One of the biggest barriers is the assumption that blind people just won’t be interested in visual media. “Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision,” says McCann. “I think that’s one big misconception: ‘Oh, well, they don’t care about pictures.’ But we do.” When culture is molded on social networks, it sucks to lose out on a shared social language because you can’t see the images everyone is talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzvxYs"&gt;Christy Smith Berman, a low vision editor at Can I Play That, responded to a TT Games tweet that announced the delay of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Lego&lt;/em&gt; with text on an image. When she replied with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thepuppiesNpink/status/1377987541870243843"&gt;request for alt text&lt;/a&gt;, Smith Berman was met with responses from people expressing disbelief that blind people would even be on Twitter to begin with, let alone care about video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPr53L"&gt;Those false assumptions often mean that people are left out of fun cultural moments on social media. Memes usually involve rapidly evolving iterations of undescribed images with tiny words in weird fonts. Viral videos are reposted and shared without any kind of description, through audio or text, of what’s happening on-screen. “Oh, that must be somebody dancing,” thinks McCann when she encounters a TikTok with no audio besides music. “Well, no, it’s actually somebody making a cheesesteak. But I didn’t know that because there’s no audio indication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1J2rQ"&gt;“A lot of the memes that people share, they don’t add alt text to it,” says Steven Aquino, a legally blind journalist. Aquino doesn’t use a screen reader, instead relying on magnification, but he’s still sometimes left wondering what’s going on in memes. “It’s really hard because I can’t see so well, and I just feel like, ‘Okay, it’s supposed to be funny, but I can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGwgYM"&gt;Beyond a simple neglect of accessibility features, conveying visual humor through text isn’t something everyone has a knack for. The funniest images rely on comedic timing through careful visual composition, prior knowledge of a specific meme, or familiarity with several different cultural references. Writing an image description for an esoteric meme can feel like explaining internet culture to your grandparents: you suddenly don’t know how to describe what exactly made you laugh. The complicated nature of meme literacy isn’t something we can blame on platforms — it’s just not something the average person is used to putting into words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqKMu"&gt;But there are other less complicated factors that can impact the online experiences of people who are blind or have low vision. Aquino points out that people will use special unicode characters in their Twitter display names that are harder to read and aren’t interpreted as letters by screen reading software. A screen reader isn’t technically incorrect if it reads a character as “mathematical bold capital,” but most sighted people will read it simply as a letter with different formatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qslmkH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You       it's    ℯ to       your tweets and usernames         . But have you          to what it             with assistive technologies like          ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/CywCf1b3Lm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CywCf1b3Lm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kent C. Dodds (@kentcdodds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1083073242330361856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WinCPc"&gt;“For people that do use screen readers, this software is only so smart,” says Aquino. “So if you’ve got a clever name, your voiceover or whatever it is that you use is going to fail.” Tweets that include rows of emojis, or a lot of special characters to create an image or convey cursive script, can be &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ieAkh6rMARc"&gt;hellish to listen to&lt;/a&gt; when they’re read by a screen reader. Posting a screenshot of the tweet with alt text is a workable alternative, but people rarely know to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRaKBL"&gt;McCann is glad that many sites have improved their accessibility options over the years, but she wishes they were more widely used and wonders why they aren’t better promoted. TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/accessibility/en-us/"&gt;text to speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612380/tiktok-photosensitive-epilepsy-warning-update-coming"&gt;warns people&lt;/a&gt; when flashing effects in their videos might trigger seizures, so why can’t all social sites have better prompts for encouraging users to add captions, visual descriptions, and alt text? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8MLce"&gt;“The onus is on the disability community to educate,” she says. “Why isn’t there more education from these mainstream companies?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hU0uVJ"&gt;McCann wishes it were easier for her to join the party when things like TikTok videos go viral. “Unless I have someone sit with me and explain to me what’s going on, I definitely feel like I can’t have a conversation about it with someone,” she says. “It is exclusionary to a point, because I like jokes. I like pasta recipes. I want to know that stuff! I’m still a part of the social fabric.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RIgILf"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749302/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_001.jpg" alt="Animation of a blank Instagram post on the left emitting an audio waveform that breaks apart before reaching an ear on the right."&gt;&lt;video src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/a848f8f12adea7db7f62510d854c986b/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_001.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;
