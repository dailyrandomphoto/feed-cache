    <title>Twitter suspends Sci-Hub account amid Indian court case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Sci-Hub site, with its logo of a raven holding a red key, and a search bar for finding articles. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4X8APx8PFPTXQ0DE-X91U-mIMj4=/0x0:972x648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638986/scihub_home_page.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sci-Hub’s homepage.  | Sci-Hub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFjp1I"&gt;Twitter has suspended the account of Sci-Hub, a website that provides free access to paywalled academic papers. The account was being used by Sci-Hub’s founder to collect statements of support from the scientific community during an ongoing court case in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="76nWlY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter suspends the account of Sci-Hub &lt;a href="https://t.co/XQfNYmR1Ra"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XQfNYmR1Ra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Catalin Cimpanu (@campuscodi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1347551800338112513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhIM5k"&gt;Journal articles are often costly to access, and many researchers and writers use services like Sci-Hub to bypass those costs. Publishers are unhappy about their content being distributed for free and argue that the site infringes on their copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0LzVH"&gt;In December, academic publishers Elsevier, Wiley, and the American Chemical Society filed a suit with the Delhi High Court, asking Indian internet service providers to block Sci-Hub and similar site Libgen. The court rejected the publishers’ requests that the sites be blocked immediately, instead declaring it &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sci-hub-libgen-case-delhi-hc-to-hear-students-researchers/story-PxBftjgAPFPfuXGok4qG7N.html"&gt;an “issue of public importance”&lt;/a&gt; and allowing time for the scientific community to weigh in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li1FzC"&gt;Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan had been using Twitter to gather and archive &lt;a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter.tweets.pdf"&gt;responses from Indian researchers&lt;/a&gt;, who argue that Sci-Hub is critical to their work. It’s unclear if the suspension is directly related to the court case, but “it happened right after Indian scientists revolted against Elsevier and other academic publishers after Sci-Hub posted on Twitter about the danger of being blocked,” Elbakyan &lt;a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-founder-criticises-sudden-twitter-ban-over-over-counterfeit-content-210108"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TorrentFreak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZXtzW"&gt;Publishers have tried to pursue legal action against Elbakyan several times before, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit"&gt;but Sci-Hub has prevailed&lt;/a&gt;. As the “Pirate Bay of Science,” the site frequently switches domains to combat takedowns. &lt;/p&gt;

The SpongeBob Reef-Top, which will only be available in Madden’s arcade-style The Yard mode, will offer challenges that you can complete to unlock Nickelodeon-themed content as well as gear inspired by the famous yellow sponge himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIZIiU"&gt;In “the coming weeks,” you’ll also be able to unlock gear themed after Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and Squidward Tentacles. (TIL that Squidward’s canon last name is Tentacles.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixI4Xl"&gt;Check out the field and some of the gear in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/1347325823372681223"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from Madden’s Twitter account.

    <title>Apple and Google face pressure to deplatform Parler over calls to violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="This illustration picture shows the social media website from Parler displayed on a computer screen. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XO_GO-OWfrvK8Qozat1kLO5T484=/0x15:4000x2682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638888/1225872887.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WDGyqC"&gt;Apple and Google are facing new pressure to deplatform Parler, a social network founded as a less moderated and more conservative-friendly alternative to Facebook and Twitter. Activist group Sleeping Giants has called on both companies to ban Parler from their app stores in response to posts calling for violence against elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBxgR6"&gt;As evidence, the group posted screenshots of Parler posts calling for Vice President Mike Pence to face a firing squad and encouraging “American Patriots” to return to the capital on January 19th “carrying Our weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NSgQ3X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, we asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GooglePlay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GooglePlay&lt;/a&gt; to enforce their own Terms of Service on Parler based on the sheer number of violent threats on the platform with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PullParler?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PullParler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at the VERY CLEAR terms set by these two app stores below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4"&gt;https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1347522919992336387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiVyHk"&gt;The group points out that both Google and Apple have clear rules against violent threats and moderation of content. Apple’s App Store says apps must have “a method for filtering objectionable material from being posted” and “a mechanism to report offensive content.” Google’s Play Store bars apps that “depict or facilitate gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities,” and that “we don’t allow apps that contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or bullying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfmlvL"&gt;Neither Apple nor Google replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Parler also did not reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNiOPG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;Parler saw its numbers skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; after Twitter and Facebook tightened their moderation, with conservative protesters finding a home among like-minded users. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-john-matze.html?"&gt;Thursday interview with Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Parler CEO John Matze said any posts on the site indicating Wednesday’s riots were “illegally organized and against the law” would have been removed. “But I don’t feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we’re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpnbBG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained particular momentum among Parler users, as well as other conspiracy theories around the election that had been debunked elsewhere. In the wake of the Capitol raid, researchers have circulated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;dozens of posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the attack on the Capitol. “Chloroform. Silencers. SHARP knives &amp;amp; keep walking,” reads one, “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” reads another, to which someone replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;On Thursday evening, the site had posts from Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1347570822437863424"&gt;questioning whether his concession speech&lt;/a&gt; was a deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmpzSI"&gt;There is some precedent for removing an app for hosting violent content. After a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned the social network Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic rants on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple had rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google removed the app from the Google Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VayTgj"&gt;Since Apple and Google control the biggest smartphone operating systems, the companies wield immense power over mobile app distribution. The inability to push its app on the two biggest app stores greatly reduced Gab’s reach, forcing users to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;workarounds to use it&lt;/a&gt; on mobile sites. Gab’s desktop site, however, appears alive and well, with a new post from President Trump extolling the “great American Patriots who voted for me” leading the site’s “hot” posts on Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcmjee"&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook have implemented temporary bans on President Trump’s accounts, treating recent statements as likely to provoke violence. The platforms had previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;adopted strict policies against election and voting misinformation&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2N9IJ"&gt;In a post on Parler Thursday, &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/23a2c1d63ea94c74b04d03917ad03339"&gt;Matze criticized Facebook and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for their actions against the president’s posts. “It’s clear that Facebook and Twitter believe the ends justify the means. They believe the American people are weak. They insult our founding fathers by suggesting Zuckerburg [sic] and Dorsey know what is best for us,” he wrote. “Parler is not an arbiter of truth. We believe in you. We believe you are wise enough to decide for yourself and trust that given access to all information we can self govern.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack is adding theming options to change the look of newsletters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Substack theming options" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfC8i_K7IStiupGuCA3AAbZTZik=/108x0:1038x620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638876/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_5.16.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7oxsZ"&gt;Substack is adding a long-awaited new feature today: the ability to change the look of newsletters. Writers will now be able to choose their background color and accent color and set different fonts for the title and body of posts. It’s a limited set of customizations, but it should allow Substack newsletters to stand out more from one another — right now, they’re basically the same, save for profile pictures and the color of links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfogyf"&gt;The feature is being called Themes, and Substack says it plans to continually add more options for writers. It’s supposed to be available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Substack’s theme editor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSsG3CwFRqsBFtVcP_8oBY12jJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220841/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_4.57.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ejPgAz"&gt;As fun as themes are, writers may get a lot more use out of two other features that Substack is planning for release sometime “soon.” Writers will be able to create sub-lists of members and only send out certain emails to them (Substack imagines lists of “founding members” or “lapsed readers”). It’s also adding a “multipub” tool that will allow writers to aggregate multiple newsletters and podcasts they manage under a single publication. &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; already has this tool and uses it to &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/"&gt;bundle a dozen titles&lt;/a&gt;, but soon it’ll be available to everyone. Substack expects the new options to launch in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmFYpt"&gt;The features were announced this morning during &lt;a href="https://substack.com/on"&gt;Substack On&lt;/a&gt;, a one-day virtual conference for Substack writers. Substack was founded in 2017, and over the past year, has become an increasingly popular choice for journalists who want to run subscription publications. It’s managed to attract some high-profile names, including Anne Helen Petersen, Glenn Greenwald, and Matthew Yglesias.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s sudden accelerations were user error, US government says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlJvub_tLw_n7EfJ1ZjIePVOVig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638815/jbareham_180213_2301_0099.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1p5gd"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ended a year-long review of claims that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070324/tesla-sudden-unexpected-acceleration-nhtsa-petition"&gt;some Tesla vehicles were accelerating without warning&lt;/a&gt;, saying there is not enough evidence to open a full investigation. While NHTSA received 246 complaints about this “sudden unintended acceleration” phenomenon, the agency says that “pedal misapplication” was the cause of the problem in every case in which it had data to review — user error, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVE0aw"&gt;“There is no evidence of any fault in the accelerator pedal assemblies, motor control systems, or brake systems that has contributed to any of the cited incidents,” the agency wrote in &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INCLA-DP20001-6158.PDF"&gt;a summary published Friday&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no evidence of a design factor contributing to increased likelihood of pedal misapplication. The theory provided of a potential electronic cause of SUA in the subject vehicles is based upon inaccurate assumptions about system design and log data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjoQxy"&gt;Claims of so-called “sudden unintended acceleration” have dogged Tesla for years. The company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/tesla-resolves-most-of-lawsuit-that-alleges-sudden-acceleration"&gt;settled most of a purported class action lawsuit in 2018 over the issue&lt;/a&gt;. NHTSA says it collected crash data and video from cars’ “black box” event data recorders and from Tesla itself. While 246 cases were reported, the agency did not specify the amount of cases for which it collected data. The issue was thought to affect some 662,000 vehicles across Tesla’s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFzyPk"&gt;The review was opened in January 2020 in response to a “defect petition” by Brian Sparks, &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INBC-DP20001-3494.pdf"&gt;an investor who was shorting Tesla’s stock&lt;/a&gt; (or betting that the price would go down). He corralled more than 100 complaints about the issue that had already been submitted to NHTSA as well as similar events that had been covered in the press, and asked the agency to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdrueF"&gt;“I believe Tesla vehicles have a structural flaw which puts their drivers and the public at risk. I further believe Tesla must know of this flaw and be unresponsive to it,” he &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INBC-DP20001-3494.pdf"&gt;wrote in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Sparks also took issue with Tesla’s reluctance to provide data about these acceleration events to owners. “This petition will show that, based on publicly available information, it appears Tesla vehicles have a Sudden Unintended Acceleration Problem and Tesla must know about this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgv0mH"&gt;Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/no-unintended-acceleration-tesla-vehicles"&gt;responded to the review with a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that claimed there was no merit to the idea. “We investigate every single incident where the driver alleges to us that their vehicle accelerated contrary to their input, and in every case where we had the vehicle’s data, we confirmed that the car operated as designed,” the company wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM unveils new logo to emphasize its pivot to electric vehicles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VjXHp3WIPEO8gKdg0G9p8VJT6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638682/GM_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QEzB13"&gt;General Motors debuted a new logo meant to convey the automaker’s renewed commitment to the production and sale of electric vehicles. The company is also launching a new marketing campaign to underscore that commitment, as it seeks to compete with Tesla and other automakers that are rushing new EVs to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3lJqm"&gt;It’s been about a decade since GM has last tweaked its logo, but this update represents the starkest change in the company’s 113-year history. The most obvious change is the use of a lowercase “gm” in the logo, after previously only using capital letters. The underline has been shortened to just the “m,” in a nod to the company’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium electric vehicle battery and platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYdVXJ"&gt;The blue square has been rounded at the corners, giving the logo more of a smartphone app appearance. The blue is used as an outline rather than to fill the entire square, and the negative space in the “m” is meant to evoke the shape of an electrical plug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfWrEv"&gt;“This is only the fifth logo change in 113 years,” said Deborah Wahl, chief marketing officer of GM, in a briefing with reporters Friday. “And probably the most progressive thing that we’ve done since 1964.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PBg64y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is only the fifth logo change in 113 years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuEex2"&gt;A new marketing campaign will punctuate GM’s shift to electric vehicles. &lt;em&gt;Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt; author Malcolm Gladwell has been tapped as a spokesperson for the automaker.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WqwRQzA37JAFuBDKkldCARJW3hY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22222254/GM_Gladwell_Print_jpg.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WvvTyT"&gt;As an umbrella company for a family of auto brands, GM’s logo isn’t as recognizable as some of its rivals like Ford or Tesla. For example, the new logo won’t appear on any of its new EVs, from the Cadillac Lyriq to the GMC Hummer EV. As such, the new marketing campaign is intended to push the message of the company’s overall commitment to electrification rather than sell any one vehicle.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SojemT"&gt;GM has been loudly trumpeting its multibillion-dollar pivot to electrification for months now, while keeping an eye on the meteoric rise of Tesla’s stock price. On Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw his own net worth surpass Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, making him the richest man in the world. And today, for the first time, Tesla’s stock value &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-tesla/teslas-market-value-zooms-past-that-of-gm-and-ford-combined-idUSKBN1Z72MU"&gt;eclipsed the combined values&lt;/a&gt; of GM and Ford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5n9tYz"&gt;GM has been trying to convince investors of its own commitment to electric vehicles. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;recently committed&lt;/a&gt; to spending $27 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025 — up from the $20 billion it announced before the COVID-19 pandemic. GM has also said it will launch 30 new electric vehicles around the world, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdXOM6"&gt;GM unveiled two new EVs in 2020: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;the Cadillac Lyriq SUV&lt;/a&gt;, expected to go into production in late 2022, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, slated for late 2021. But the auto giant has been criticized for bringing vehicles to market too late, while other automakers are racing to get their EVs to customers much sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWwc3x"&gt;Up next will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401302/gm-chevy-bolt-tease-image-electric-ev"&gt;two new versions of the Chevy Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, the automaker’s mass-market electric car that has been on sale since 2017. A refreshed Bolt and a larger Bolt Electric Utility Vehicle were first announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;the automaker’s “EV Day”&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and are expected to enter production in summer 2021. GM has also said it would release an electric Chevy pickup truck with 400 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2Dt2g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus is offering a free pair of Bud Z wireless earbuds when you preorder the Nord N10 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EeJ1RuHQl8hszhwP_E2JyQChFto=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638672/ajohnson200104_4354_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UKmnmx"&gt;The OnePlus Nord line of smartphones will debut in the US on January 15th with two cheaper, midrange entries: the Nord N10 5G and the N100. You can preorder both phones from a variety of retailers ahead of release, but if you decide to buy either directly from OnePlus, the company will throw in a pair of wireless earbuds for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJDP6Y"&gt;Starting today until January 14th, OnePlus will include a pair of OnePlus Bud Z wireless earbuds (white only) at no additional cost when you purchase the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-n10-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F8%2F22220369%2Foneplus-nord-n10-5g-playstation-plus-subscription-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; on its site. If you buy the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-n100&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F8%2F22220369%2Foneplus-nord-n10-5g-playstation-plus-subscription-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nord N100&lt;/a&gt; from the OnePlus website, you will get a pair of Bullets Wireless Z earbuds in black for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4pBos1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ceIJgQ"&gt;According to my colleague Allison Johnson, the Nord N10 5G is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;an affordable 5G-capable phone that doesn’t cut too many corners&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-n100&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F8%2F22220369%2Foneplus-nord-n10-5g-playstation-plus-subscription-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Nord N100&lt;/a&gt; costs $180 and features a larger (albeit lower-resolution) display, but it includes a 5,000mAh battery (which is larger than the OnePlus 8T’s 4,500mAh battery). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyu0e5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273236"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwsjNu"&gt;PS4 and PS5 owners: if you need to renew your subscription to PlayStation Plus, you can grab a one-year subscription for less than its usual price of $60. The lowest prices you can get for a one-year membership are at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://www.cdkeys.com/playstation-network-psn/playstation-plus/1-year-playstation-plus-membership-ps3-ps4-ps-vita-digital-code" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CDKeys for $30&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba for $32&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, both codes are also region-locked at each retailer, so you will need a US PlayStation Network account to redeem the membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWF4Pb"&gt;Given the competitive pricing at both retailers, I anticipate inventory to &lt;em&gt;sell out quickly&lt;/em&gt;, so don’t hold off if you want to capitalize on this deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hg5e3c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lAGVYn"&gt;If you’re in the market for a smart clock that also includes a smart display, Best Buy has a great deal on &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728849449997447546" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $50, you can get this device for just $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jknW4x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273272"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1S0PgY"&gt;Best Buy has a few incredible gaming deals available for Switch owners. One of those deals includes &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728851182559056385" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 off &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a compilation featuring three HD ports of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;. This is a time-limited product that will be available until March 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nRGo2y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273318"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5C9Xha"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; will not only deliver Switch owners a great workout experience, but it is also a fun game. If you’re a Switch owner looking to achieve some fitness goals this year, you can snag &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728851577196507064" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; for only $70 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;; that’s $10 off its usual price of $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F1MpnS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273326"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Dominion sues former Trump lawyer over voting machine conspiracy theory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="RNC Trump Presser with Giuliani" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9o-_VG7XVOVleiqgWyMRsHqEDM4=/0x0:5374x3583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638602/1229768128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="scysz2"&gt;Dominion Voting Systems is suing President Donald Trump’s former attorney Sidney Powell for spreading unfounded conspiracy theories about its election equipment. The long-awaited defamation suit could test the impact of legal attacks on disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gWA7g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/dominion-sues-trump-lawyer-sidney-powell-defamation-seeks-1-3-n1253464"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this morning, Dominion sued Powell for making a series of “wild” and “demonstrably false” accusations that spread across right-wing media outlets and major social networks. Powell was responsible for a series of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4ad3ad/sidney-powells-release-the-kraken-lawsuits-are-a-real-mess"&gt;legally dubious challenges&lt;/a&gt; that she dubbed the “kraken,” but she failed to substantiate their allegations — which &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-55090145"&gt;included false claims&lt;/a&gt; that Dominion had rigged voting machines to favor President-elect Joe Biden as part of a plot involving &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-hugo-chavez-dead-since-2013-became-responsible-for-trumps-election-loss"&gt;deceased Venezuelan president&lt;/a&gt; Hugo Chávez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GE4DVy"&gt;Powell promoted her claims through a variety of right-wing news outlets, including Fox News and One America News Network. “Countless media outlets and social media users foreseeably republished and disseminated the viral disinformation campaign about Dominion,” &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.225699/gov.uscourts.dcd.225699.1.0_3.pdf"&gt;the complaint reads&lt;/a&gt;. This led to calls for Dominion employees to be killed or imprisoned, including direct threats. “Since the beginning of the viral disinformation campaign, Dominion has spent more than $565,000 on private security for the protection of its people,” the company says. It’s also allegedly spent more than $1.1 million repairing harm to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNjrgL"&gt;Dominion contacted several of the conspiracy theory’s proponents last year, requesting a retraction. It told Powell that “as a result of Powell’s false accusations, Dominion had suffered enormous harm and its employees had been stalked, had been harassed, and had received death threats.” Some news outlets appeared &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55413932"&gt;responsive to its legal threats&lt;/a&gt;. Fox News, for instance, aired a segment admitting that its claims about Dominion had no evidence. But in the words of the complaint, Powell “doubled down” on her attacks, tweeting that she was “retracting nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrIGuu"&gt;The Trump administration spread a raft of false narratives attempting to undermine Biden’s election victory. Many of those claims have persisted long after being debunked, and earlier this week, they led a mob of Trump supporters to overrun the US Capitol — leading to at least five deaths, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/brian-sicknick-police-capitol-dies.html"&gt;one police officer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3cT4d"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/business/media/smartmatic-lawsuit-fox-news-newsmax-oan.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; media columnist Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; wrote in December, Dominion’s lawsuit  could make it riskier for high-profile figures to knowingly and repeatedly spread unfounded conspiracy theories — particularly if those theories spin out of control online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyKVCp"&gt;Dominion is requesting $1.3 billion in compensation and a removal of Powell’s claims. Its suit &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-dominion/dominion-voting-systems-employee-sues-trump-campaign-for-defamation-idUSKBN28X0EB"&gt;follows a similar complaint&lt;/a&gt; by an individual Dominion employee who was harassed because of the Trump campaign’s false claims.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends: Wild Rift’s open beta comes to North America in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mC1-8yIxyOKZnXTaCAQFGRaR8wI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638333/wr_katarina_model.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4EYKC"&gt;Fans in North America will be able to play &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; on their phones very soon. Today, at a big event detailing what 2021 will look like for &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;, developer Riot revealed that &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274419/league-of-legends-wild-rift-gameplay-trailer-mobile-console"&gt;the mobile and console version of the game&lt;/a&gt; — will launch in open beta in the Americas starting in March. It’s not clear what platforms the beta will be available on, but previous open betas were primarily on Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXoTtQ"&gt;Additionally, Riot outlined its plans to support &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift &lt;/em&gt;throughout the year. That includes regular events like a Lunar New Year festival in February, a ranked season that kicks off in some regions this week, and the addition of around two new characters each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nzT0Q"&gt;The other big reveal from the event relates to Riot’s esports ambitions. &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is arguably the biggest competitive game in the world right now, and Riot is trying to do something similar for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612562/valorant-champions-tour-esports-2021"&gt;its tactical shooter &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So it should come as no surprise that the developer now says it’s looking to build out esports scenes for its trio of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs: &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqYCQt"&gt;Competitive mobile games like &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt; are some of the most popular in the world, so it makes a lot of sense that Riot would try something similar with its smartphone titles, however there aren’t a lot of details on what the scenes will look like just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTrJHq"&gt;Meanwhile, the developer also announced that this year’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship will be held in Shenzhen, China. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;Last year’s event took place in Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision will premiere with two episodes on Disney Plus </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K56vQJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is Marvel Studios’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168373/wandavision-trailer-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;first big Disney Plus release&lt;/a&gt;, and the show will circumvent Disney’s typical episode release structure by premiering two episodes at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8kTG6"&gt;The first two episodes of the show will premiere together on January 15th, with the third episode premiering a week later on January 22nd. Normally, Disney only releases one episode per week. There are exceptions: National Geographic shows have released more episodes at once. Most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mandalorian"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; first two episodes came out three days apart, but that was due to Disney Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963172/disney-plus-subscribers-10-million-star-wars-marvel-pixar-launch"&gt;launching on a Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and new episodes airing Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gv5TZN"&gt;Why are Disney and Marvel Studios releasing two episodes at once? No idea! The company didn’t give a reason in the &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/wandavision-two-episodes-premiere-confirmed-marvel-disney-plus-reelase-date/"&gt;press release sent out today&lt;/a&gt;, but there are a couple of assumptions we can make. Since the show centers on both Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), maybe each has their own episode that works better in a pairing? Considering the show is a little more abstract than other series, perhaps Disney is concerned the pilot would underwhelm or leave people confused, so teed up a second one for fans to play immediately after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1b1NXo"&gt;Regardless of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Disney is doing it, the fact is Marvel will provide two, half-hour episodes for people to stream on January 15th. If the remaining seven episodes are released weekly after that, &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;will conclude on March 5th. Marvel Studio’s next show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328889/falcon-winter-soldier-delay-disney-plus-marvel-studios-avengers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;premiere on March 19th&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel Studios’ first theatrical release since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20734621/disney-record-breaking-2019-box-office-avengers-endgame-lion-king-aladdin-avatar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2019, is slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;hit theaters on May 7th&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it stays there (it all depends on how many theaters are open and if people are going back to theaters en masse by that date) is unclear right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCmPZ3"&gt;A full synopsis for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;can be read below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MTtRB5"&gt;The series is a blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision — two super-powered beings living idealized suburban lives — begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
