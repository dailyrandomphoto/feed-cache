    <title>Tiger King season 2 premieres November 17th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G10PQk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;, the hugely popular documentary heavily associated with the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkgSGrdL4SE"&gt;will premiere on November 17th&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix revealed at its Tudum event on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="StORaF"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689601/tiger-king-season-2-netflix-announcement-2021-joe-exotic"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; the second season, which it is calling &lt;em&gt;Tiger King 2&lt;/em&gt;, on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo3WUYBcNJI"&gt;as part of a short trailer&lt;/a&gt; revealing many other true crime shows heading to the streaming service. Netflix is promising that it will have “just as much mayhem and madness” as the first season. While it’s unclear exactly what the second season might be about, Netflix’s Tudum trailer showed a brief clip of Joe Exotic, the main focus of the first season, in prison, so it could focus in part on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wbZIJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;’s first season was a cultural sensation; in a press release, &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/tiger-king-2-leads-pack-of-upcoming-documentaries-exploring-crimes-cons-and"&gt;Netflix said&lt;/a&gt; that it “attracted 64 million households in the first four weeks after its March 2020 premiere.” By making a season 2, Netflix seems to be attempting to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle popularity once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s new trailer for Arcane, its upcoming League of Legends series, reveals November 6th premiere date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZY9GSSwGkhX9HltVea5pj8XcLf0=/127x0:1417x860/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908235/Vi_Lookingup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Lkt79"&gt;Netflix has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmAurh012s"&gt;a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its upcoming series based on the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe, and also revealed when the show will premiere: November 6th. But you won’t be able to watch all of &lt;em&gt;Arcane &lt;/em&gt;on that day, as Netflix plans to release the season in three separate “acts,” each consisting of three episodes released one week after the last. That means the first act will be out on November 6th, the next will release on November 13th, and the final one will premiere on November 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2wMoU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games delayed the series &lt;a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. In May, the news broke that Netflix had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;picked up the show&lt;/a&gt; and that it would debut in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDa17H"&gt;Earlier this week, Netflix and Riot revealed some of&lt;em&gt; Arcane’s &lt;/em&gt;voice cast. That list is headlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1440332544784748550"&gt;by Hailee Steinfeld&lt;/a&gt;, who you might recognize as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942091/dickinson-apple-tv-plus-review-hailee-steinfeld"&gt;Emily Dickinson in Apple TV Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Kate Bishop in the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671358/hawkeye-first-trailer-disney-plus-christmas-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld"&gt;in Disney Plus series &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, Steinfeld will be playing Vi, one of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ playable champions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0kwJI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is Riot’s latest expansion of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; franchise, which includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358213/league-of-legends-wild-rift-iphone-android-preview"&gt;mobile spinoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;a board game&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"&gt;comic books&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also the latest video game series to appear on Netflix, joining other franchises like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22566778/the-witcher-season-2-release-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232750/netflix-pokemon-exclusive-episodes-disney-hbo-max-kids-tv-anime-streaming-wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Delta Airlines wants competitors to share info about unruly passengers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Delta Air Lines Airbus A330neo Landing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWctvo6VUCBK16IUXQaZkmLLhI8=/0x0:5300x3533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908212/1232127899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZcnYxO"&gt;Delta Airlines said in a &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/memos-reflect-deltas-commitment-employee-and-passenger-safety"&gt;pair of internal memos&lt;/a&gt; to employees this week that it’s asked competitors to share their no-fly lists, to try to keep passengers who cause disturbances on planes from bringing their mayhem to other airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xuTX0"&gt;Since January 1st, the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/unruly"&gt;says it has received&lt;/a&gt; 4,385 reports of unruly behavior by passengers, which includes 3,199 reports of passengers “refusing to comply with the federal facemask mandate.” The FAA has issued more than $1 million in proposed fines, but the agency does not have the authority to conduct criminal prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41sb2Y"&gt;Among the incidents, according to the FAA (these are across various airlines):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yOxqdp"&gt;On a May 24th flight from New York to Orlando a passenger was “allegedly throwing objects, including his carry-on luggage, at other passengers; refusing to stay seated; lying on the floor in the aisle, refusing to get up, and then grabbing a flight attendant by the ankles and putting his head up her skirt.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SwXu78"&gt;On a May 16th flight from New York to San Francisco, a passenger was “allegedly interfering with crewmembers after failing to comply with the facemask mandate; making non-consensual physical contact with another passenger; throwing a playing card at a passenger and threatening him with physical harm; making stabbing gestures towards certain passengers; and snorting what appeared to be cocaine from a plastic bag, which the cabin crew confiscated.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="seP91t"&gt;On an April 12th flight form Boston to Orlando a passenger was “allegedly interfering with crewmembers after refusing to comply with the facemask mandate. She also shouted obscenities at the flight crew, and intentionally bumped into a seated passenger on her way to the lavatory. When the seated passenger objected to this behavior, she punched the passenger in the face.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GaswoX"&gt;The passengers in those incidents were referred to law enforcement and the FAA has proposed fines ranging from $29,000 to $45,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etIxa7"&gt;Delta sent its memos to employees the same day that airline industry representatives took part in an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/unruly-us-airline-passenger-incidents-fall-still-higher-than-2020-faa-2021-09-23/"&gt;“air rage” hearing&lt;/a&gt; before the House Committee on Transportation &amp;amp; Infrastructure, asking Congress to encourage the Department of Justice to take more serious measures against unruly passengers, including possible criminal indictments. Interfering with flight crew aboard an airplane is a federal crime that has a max sentence of up to 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix debuts video from its adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIVsi0TH-nuSG7z4jAwKWTbNdV0=/0x2:1698x1134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908157/Screen_Shot_2021_09_25_at_10.13.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pmDE6N"&gt;Netflix debuted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBXqrBl6pEo"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from its upcoming series based on Neil Gaiman’s DC comic book series &lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;. The video was brief, but it gave us a good glimpse at actor Tom Sturridge as Dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaiJZt"&gt;The video was shown during Netflix’s Tudum event that took place Saturday. The show also also featured Gaiman, Sturridge, and Kirby Howell-Baptiste (who plays Death) talking about the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qBR7d"&gt;If you want to get another preview of what to expect from the series, check out the character posters Netflix shared for Sturridge’s Dream, Howell-Baptiste’s Death, and Mason Alexander Park’s Desire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441813546560630784"&gt;in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4DXJ3y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Death has family" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;meet Tom Sturridge as Dream in Netflix's THE SANDMAN &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TUDUM?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TUDUM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/sLb3SDQdaG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sLb3SDQdaG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441813546560630784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXvb7Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt; has been in development for years, with Netflix picking up the show in 2019 in a deal with Warner Bros., which owns DC Entertainment, that was reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/sandman-tv-series-neil-gaiman-david-goyer-a-go-at-netflix-1220761/"&gt;“massive.”&lt;/a&gt; Earlier this year, Netflix announced &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/the-sandman-tom-sturridge-gwendoline-christie-vivienne-acheampong-boyd-holbrook-charles-dance-asim-chaudhry-sanjeev-bhaskar-netflix-neil-gaiman-1234681995/"&gt;some of the cast for the show&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes Vivienne Acheampong as Lucienne and Gwendoline Christie (known for playing Brienne of Tarth in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and Captain Phasma in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;) as Lucifer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85NuPR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt; is just the latest show based on Gaiman’s work. Amazon adapted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645935/neil-gaiman-interview-good-omens-amazon-adaptation-terry-pratchett-michael-sheen-david-tennant"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Amazon Prime Video, and the show was successful enough that the company opted to pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555489/good-omens-second-season-amazon-prime-video-neil-gaiman-terry-prachett"&gt;a second season&lt;/a&gt;. Starz made three seasons of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;, the last of which debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22233014/american-gods-season-3-premiere-review"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See inside the iPhone 13 Pro in iFixit’s latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zPGKdX2GYMScpQ9aCS8Mt6E-oV0=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908059/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iPhone 13 Pro | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tXl1KP"&gt;The team at iFixit has a new teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro, finding it has an enormous battery and some small internal changes to how the components are laid out to accommodate the smaller notch on this year’s models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4DUVl"&gt;First, the battery. After conducting battery swap tests, on the iPhone 13 Pro, iFixit found its tests succeeded, but still got a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F32343%2Fapple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F25%2F22693123%2Fiphone-13-pro-ifixit-teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warning notification.&lt;/a&gt; The L-shaped battery echoes the iPhone 12 Pro Max, iFixit notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HInpUx"&gt;This beefy L caps out at an expected 11.97 Wh compared to the 10.78 Wh obelisk found in the iPhone 12 Pro (and non-Pro), but loses out to the standard’s 12.54 Wh rectangular cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWFmkpVEq1xlFSZr_DTup5QPyPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877335/ifixit_x_ray.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;An X-ray image of iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxtXHE"&gt;iFixit posits that Apple was able to shrink the screen notch partly by moving the earpiece speaker from the back of the display to inside the chassis. It does make replacing the earpiece speaker more difficult, iFixit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XB-bKQOtb76HRX2raPxiZwRDWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877338/earpiece_ifixit.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dxHGY6"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is sealed with adhesive, like the iPhone 13 and some prior iPhones, and iFixit says the display came off relatively easily. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DByV2eyXDtfHaM5NIlmWAOZOkzA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877310/ifixit_teardown_iphone_13_pro.png"&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things season 4 gets a new teaser trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8GZ3G6fY4P5gYfpKa-qvgfWhrJY=/160x0:1716x1037/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908053/Screen_Shot_2021_09_25_at_9.16.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fxTVh1"&gt;Netflix debuted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgsUzL75Yjk"&gt;new teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; season 4 as part of its Tudum event on Saturday. It opened on a family going into an old-timey house, but in classic &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; fashion, things quickly got spooky and, well, strange. The new season will premiere sometime in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y7wDy"&gt;The fourth season has been a long time coming. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683399/stranger-things-season-3-review-duffer-brothers-finn-wolfhard-millie-bobby-brown-david-harbour"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;’ third season&lt;/a&gt; debuted more than two years ago, on July 4th, 2019, so fans have been waiting for quite a while to see what happens next in Netflix’s hit series. (Season 3 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692109/stranger-things-3-netflix-nielsen-media-research-hit"&gt;quite popular&lt;/a&gt; — just four days after it launched, Netflix said that 18.2 million accounts had watched the whole season.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVZ6xU"&gt;The company has already shared a few very fleeting hints about what to expect in season 4, though. In February 2020, a teaser revealed that a fan-favorite character &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;would be returning&lt;/a&gt;. A teaser from May appeared to show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;a brief glimpse&lt;/a&gt; of Eleven’s past. And an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612753/netflix-stranger-things-season-four-release-date"&gt;action-packed 30-second teaser&lt;/a&gt; shared in August provided a lot of brief flashes of the new season and gave a non-specific 2022 release window.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly told a TV and movie workers’ union its TV Plus had fewer than 20 million subs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Apple TV+ (Plus) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlEbrp2g2zhJqYZb7Ky9Flk9pXg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69907526/1233058085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A union for TV workers says Apple claimed its TV Plus streaming service had fewer than 20 million subscribers as of July 1st | Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qauvj"&gt;Apple told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that its Apple TV Plus streaming platform had fewer than 20 million subscribers, which allowed it to pay lower rates to IATSE workers than bigger streaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/apple-told-a-showbiz-union-it-had-less-than-20-million-tv-subscribers.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jynhWz"&gt;Apple has never publicly released subscriber numbers for its streaming network, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20850842/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-shows-oprah-streaming"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in November of 2019. But Apple TV Plus has fewer original shows than larger, more established streaming rivals like Netflix, which &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;said in August&lt;/a&gt; it had 209 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T5itS"&gt;“Workers on certain ‘new media’ streaming projects get paid less, even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters,” according to a press release IATSE posted on Tuesday. The release didn’t mention any streaming platform by name, but a spokesman told CNBC that Apple claimed under 20 million subscribers in the US and Canada as of July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HpKP6"&gt;The union is preparing for a possible strike after negotiations with production companies have stalled, saying in the release that “the explosion of streaming combined with the pandemic has elevated and aggravated working conditions, bringing 60,000 behind-the-scenes workers covered by these contracts to a breaking point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ALLId"&gt;Apple TV Plus has several big-budget shows on its roster, including &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, its surprise hit comedy about an American coaching an English football club. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; had a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/emmy-awards-2021-list-winners-nominees-11632095321?mod=article_relatedinline"&gt;big showing at the Emmys&lt;/a&gt; last week, taking awards for Outstanding Comedy, Lead Actor in a Comedy for star Jason Sudeikis, and supporting acting awards for Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyu1vc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/apples-bumpy-tv-launch-inside-tech-giants-impending-arrival-hollywood-1247577/"&gt;reportedly costs Apple $15 million&lt;/a&gt; per episode, and many of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s writers and stars have &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ted-lasso-pay-raises-season-three-1235011799/"&gt;reportedly negotiated&lt;/a&gt; more lucrative contracts for the show’s third season. Apple said in July that it had a net profit of $21.7 billion on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;$81.43 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbyfC"&gt;Apple and IATSE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. An Apple spokesperson told CNBC that it pays rates comparable to leading streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Netflix’s major Tudum event today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yRXM4NJgFQbiY85XuKdTx27ngeI=/285x0:2592x1538/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69907134/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_1.40.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fT7BsD"&gt;Netflix is kicking off a massive fan event today. Tudum — named for the ubiquitous chime that plays before Netflix titles — is a global event that will feature a huge slate of news, trailers, celebrity appearances, and more. It’s essentially the Lollapalooza of Netflix news, and anyone hoping to stay ahead of the streamer’s biggest upcoming announcements will definitely want to tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DtHsL3"&gt;What is Tudum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eQgFEa"&gt;Tudum is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;global mega-event&lt;/a&gt; — the first of its kind for Netflix. It kicks off Saturday and will feature more than 145 celebrities, 70-plus series, and 28 films over the course of several hours. Expect exclusive clips and news for forthcoming titles like &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; starring Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCdyJF"&gt;Tudum will be available in 29 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UfR2kQ"&gt;What time is Tudum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ybMpj7"&gt;The event will kick off at 9AM PT (or 12PM ET for our East Coast readers). The main event will last three hours, but Netflix will also host pre-shows for Korean and Indian films and series, as well as anime programming that will begin at 5AM PT (or 8AM ET). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rMnFCA"&gt;Where can I watch Tudum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LDEK9d"&gt;Great question! Netflix will stream &lt;a href="https://www.tudum.com/?lang=en"&gt;Tudum&lt;/a&gt; on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKgMA0MoY2Y"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channels worldwide, as well as on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/videos/899218064345155"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/netflix"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Hb5vUc"&gt;Is there a Tudum schedule?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ6IIs"&gt;There is! For an hour-by-hour breakdown of what shows will be included in which time slots, please see Netflix’s handy fan guide below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $50 on the Nanoleaf Elements wood-styled LED panels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/77Ii9fSdM-oaV1YgwzupIyidAeM=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69907183/Elements_7x_Dining_Winter_4000x2250px.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nanoleaf Elements offer some unique decor, whether illuminated or not.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kB12A1"&gt;Kicking things off are the Nanoleaf Elements light-up wall panels, which are currently seeing a nice discount at Best Buy. A seven-piece kit of the hexagon-shaped panels is $50 off right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752882625164258609#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bringing them down to $250&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to go beyond seven, you can opt for a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752882728847809246#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-panel expansion kit for $80&lt;/a&gt; (saving you $20). These panels are customizable, too, and you can connect up to 22 of them in one contiguous pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frrzP6"&gt;You may be familiar with the colorful Nanoleaf panels due to their popularity with Twitch streamers and YouTubers, but the Elements promise a more refined look with their wood styling and white illumination, which ranges from cool to warm tones. When turned off, their subtle aesthetic still complements a room while looking less like light panels that have gone out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NwkUpd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nanoleaf’s light-up wall panels now look like wood accent pieces","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="b9TMTQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771267"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-3734251510231392608IqHwmg"&gt;If you’re looking for more deals on the smart home front, Best Buy is offering several great deals on Philips Hue lighting through its Geek Squad-certified refurbished program. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752885816627976467#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our top pick is the multicolor Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with three bulbs, a Bridge, and a dimmer for $135. In addition to that, there are some nice options for accent lighting with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752888958340730338#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch Hue Play Gradient Lightstrip&lt;/a&gt;, coming in at $225, and a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752888988022964482#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-pack of Hue Play Smart LED light bars for $100&lt;/a&gt; (saving you $50).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-3734251510231392608Nimiqt"&gt;Either of those can add some drama to a room or entertainment center, while the starter kit can outfit an entire bedroom and give you easy control with the dimmer. If you’re in need of a Hue Bridge for some bulbs you have already invested in, Best Buy also has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752889079688132692#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2nd-generation Bridge for $40&lt;/a&gt; (saving you $20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sgZfO9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771290"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="39zg2l"&gt;Bose’s line of Bluetooth-enabled audio sunglasses are pretty unique. They come in a few different styles, with some models looking more casual and sleek while others are more fit for action. Right now, there are some noteworthy deals on both the Bose Frames Tempo and Bose Frames Tenor at multiple retailers. Both offer wireless audio that does not block your ears and prevent you from hearing things in your vicinity, which can be very helpful when riding a bike, commuting, or roaming around the city. For a limited time, Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752877755605596210#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tempo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752878896488204939#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tenor&lt;/a&gt; for a discounted price of $224, knocking $25 off the list price of both models. You can also get the same deal &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Frames-Tempo-Sunglasses-Connectivity/dp/B08CZL53F3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Tempo at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1591431-REG%2Fbose_851338_0110_frames_tenor_audio_sunglasses.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F25%2F22691304%2Fnanoleaf-elements-philips-hue-refurbished-bose-frames-tempo-tenor-nintendo-switch-games-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tenor at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25140924.16373/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyMzUxNDUxL2Jvc2UtZnJhbWVzLXRlbXBvLWF1ZGlvLXN1bmdsYXNzZXMtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVz/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aBc600887a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Bose Frames Tempo review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Elizabeth Holmes sidelined the real scientists at Theranos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Zj-xw6GfDSKBGFowX-wWZnezgo=/0x0:4781x3187/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69906352/1341968229.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;By leaving them off email threads&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FiQ3pL"&gt;Former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff was the second employee who testified in Elizabeth Holmes’ trial who kept his work emails. Forwarding work emails to a personal account can violate a non-disclosure agreement, which Rosendorff signed when he joined the company. But, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Surekha Gangakhedkar&lt;/a&gt; before him, he was worried he’d be blamed for the company’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVZJF4"&gt;He was right to worry: he’s one of the people Elizabeth Holmes’ defense is trying to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ElyIGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The company was more about PR and fundraising than patient care.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erCXly"&gt;In opening arguments of US v Elizabeth Holmes, the defense agreed there were problems in Theranos’ lab. But Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, said that problems in the clinical lab were ultimately the responsibility of the lab director. And besides, that lab director reported to Holmes’ co-defendant, Sunny Balwani, who is being tried separately. They face 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mluaic"&gt;Today’s testimony was about bad Theranos tests. A lot of new emails were introduced, showing Holmes was aware of the company’s problems, and was even actively trying to manage the situation. Several times in those emails, Rosendorff tried to get Theranos labs to run FDA-approved tests instead of the ones Theranos developed. But maybe even more telling were the emails that Rosendorff was excluded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3ZPHj"&gt;Rosendorff didn’t mince words when he took the witness stand. He quit because of many things, he said. “One was the unwillingness of management to perform proficiency testing as required by law, I felt pressured to vouch for tests I did not have confidence in.” That wasn’t all. He came to believe “the company was more about PR and fundraising than patient care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpnXpy"&gt;When he first joined Theranos in April 2013, Rosendorff thought Theranos might be the next Apple. But the sheen wore off the company quickly — and he began looking for other jobs by that summer. In August, before Theranos’ launch in patients, the clinical lab was “anxious” about testing real people, he said; the pace around the launch “extremely rushed and hurried.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VM23Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Raising alarm bells”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35adBP"&gt;On August 31, 2013, Elizabeth Holmes sent a 1AM email asking for an update on how many tests had completed validation. An employee wrote back that none of them had. The launch was scheduled for September 9th, 2013, and the schedule came from Holmes and Balwani, Rosendorff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gjsvt4"&gt;Increasingly worried, he tried to stall it. He was “raising alarm bells.” In an email a little more than a week before the scheduled launch, Rosendorff wrote to Holmes and Balwani raising concerns about some of the tests. He also thought the lab needed more staff with better training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqdzoX"&gt;He needed “a few more weeks to sort through these medical and logistical issues,” he wrote in the email. That would mean delaying bringing Theranos’ tests to patients. He even met with Holmes about his concerns, because he felt Balwani wasn’t taking him seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWvsXR"&gt;During that meeting Rosendorff described Holmes as “very nervous.” “She was not her usual composed self. She was trembling a little bit,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XuTTm"&gt;Despite Rosendorff’s concerns, the launch went ahead as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oaKHg0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Theranos devices “failed so frequently it raised doubts in my mind regarding the accuracy of the tests themselves.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xUWsGJ"&gt;Some of his testimony corroborated what previous Theranos employees had said. He echoed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;Erika Cheung’s concerns about removing outliers&lt;/a&gt; from Theranos data. As both Cheung and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Gangakhedkar&lt;/a&gt; testified, the Edison machines frequently failed quality control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb0nJ5"&gt;While a quarter of Theranos’ devices routinely failed quality control, failures of commercially-available tech was far less frequent. Theranos devices “failed so frequently it raised doubts in my mind regarding the accuracy of the tests themselves,” Rosendorff said. He emailed Balwani about the failure rates, who wrote back, “Adam. This is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5eN5H"&gt;Normally lab directors deal with doctors who have concerns about lab results — this was part of Rosendorff’s job at his previous employer, the University of Pittsburgh. But Theranos installed Holmes’ brother, Christian, as a liaison for complaints. Rosendorff said he was pressured to come up with explanations about bad results that didn’t call into question the tests themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5TDRB"&gt;But the tests were bad. In the case of a key pregnancy hormone — one that we heard testimony about from&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22687026/theranos-patient-bad-test-miscarriage-pregnancy"&gt; a patient who was wrongly told she was miscarrying&lt;/a&gt; — Rosendorff sent an all-caps email to his staff in May 2014 telling them that all future tests were to be run on an FDA-approved device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cxboS6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A complete mess”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nQqoGc"&gt;This didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaSCAX"&gt;In fact, there was a June 2014 email chain where Christian Holmes wrote his sister, CCing Balwani, that the test was “causing serious complaints and patient issues.” Additionally, the lab was “a complete mess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70Qz2H"&gt;Holmes wrote back that she’d connect with her brother, then added, “Sunny / this is already handled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uSxFV"&gt;There are a few notable things about the exchange. First, it demolishes the idea that Holmes could have been misled about the state of the clinical lab and its tests. Second, it shows her clearly taking charge of the situation, even telling Balwani to stand down. But third, it’s remarkable for who’s missing from the chain: Rosendorff, who may not have even been aware that his instruction to use FDA-cleared devices &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kybhb"&gt;The first time he saw those emails was in court, he said. It was not the only set of emails about patient complaints we saw where Rosendorff wasn’t included, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="P3xRFA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The test has lost any diagnostic value.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FcQlOd"&gt;In February of 2014, Rosendorff also tried to convince the company to stop running its HDL  (“good”) cholesterol test on Theranos devices. He sent an email to Balwani and added Holmes, because he thought Balwani wasn’t listening to him. “I got a lot of pushback” for suggesting the lab use approved devices, Rosendorff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmQnzB"&gt;That pushback came from Holmes, Balwani, and VP Daniel Young, he testified. And though Young didn’t have a medical degree, he often offered suggestions about what was “really” wrong with tests, Rosendorff said. Through his testimony, Rosendorff generally talked about Young in a tone that suggested he loathed the VP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpHtLH"&gt;The problems in the lab were widespread, Rosendorff testified, pointing to tests of bicarbonate, and an email where he pointed out that two-thirds of patients were reading below the normal range. “The test has lost any diagnostic value,” he emailed in September 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Zkoq8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am not sure what to do with these lab results????”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbQhUV"&gt;But Theranos wasn’t honest with physicians or providers about this. Instead, customer service representatives were instructed to say that the results “were not reported due to temporary unavailability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtIOHL"&gt;Another email from a healthcare provider said it didn’t realize Theranos’ methods weren’t FDA-approved, and complained about testosterone and blood sugar tests. “I am not sure what to do with these lab results????” the email read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvlHx7"&gt;Part of the problem was that all the validation studies had been done on venous blood, Rosendorff testified. See, to get enough fingerprick blood to run all the studies, you’d need to prick every finger on the patient — so as a matter of convenience, venous blood was drawn. But if you draw blood from fingerpricks, you’re far more likely to destroy red blood cells in the process, leading to faulty readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4InyxK"&gt;Among the bad tests was one for sodium, potassium, and chloride, called ISE. Young, who was a statistician, not a doctor, suggested the faulty results for this test was because of the red blood cells breaking apart, and urged a visual examination of the blood to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="wrstfW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This bad assay had been used on patients since September 2013. In June 2014, there were still problems with the tests.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zC31Kc"&gt;This was bad for several reasons. First of all, the FDA-approved machines detected this immediately, not after a weird reading. Second, evidence of broken red blood cells wasn’t always obvious to the eye, Rosendorff testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYGbQv"&gt;This bad assay had been used on patients since September 2013. In June 2014, there were still problems with the tests, and Young’s suggested fixes, including a “bias-correction” method, still weren’t working. So Theranos voided tests that fell above and below accepted values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5dd39"&gt;That was a problem, too. We saw an email from a doctor dated October 27th, 2014, addressed to a customer service rep. The patient had low sodium levels — which was why the test had been ordered. A customer service rep emailed Rosendorff saying, “Is it possible that that was the value? If she comes in again, and the value is still critical low, will it be voided again?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYz8re"&gt;Rosendorff forwarded this email to Balwani and Holmes, writing, “I’m not sure of a clinical value of a sodium assay in which the only time we can report it is when it is not critical and the very situations that require accurate measurement and reporting of abnormal sodium results are voided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FCwAg6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s pretty obvious we have issues with calcium, potassium, and sodium.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3NMGN"&gt;Calcium testing, too, was bad. “Are there any findings we can relay about high trends in calcium reporting?” Christian Holmes wrote to Young and Balwani. “Seems to be by far the majority of questions we get about accuracy now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkjEFW"&gt;He then forwarded this to his sister. “It’s pretty obvious we have issues with calcium, potassium, and sodium, specifically,” he wrote. “Obviously I can’t tell them we are wrong, but they continue to send patients to Quest [another blood-testing company] after we report high, and the results continue to come back normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9b9zRE"&gt;Rosendorff wasn’t included on this chain, and took issue with “specifically.” There were lots of problems with other tests, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C42Wab"&gt;“I didn’t believe at this point that Theranos could solve these problems,” Rosendorff testified. He began avoiding speaking to doctors, and told one or two physicians that he didn’t trust the results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xrZpu"&gt;All of this is bad for Holmes  — not only is she aware of the problems, she’s calling the shots. But her defense hinted at what the cross-examination of Rosendorff may bring. One of his subsequent employers was also investigated by the federal authorities, as well as another company that was subject to a justice department probe. (We found this out before the jury was allowed in the courtroom.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cds0js"&gt;It’s not clear that Rosendorff’s post-Theranos employment will be deemed relevant to the current case — the jury may hear nothing about this. But the defense will certainly have some work to do. Though Rosendorff’s testimony was much more technical than that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;board member James Mattis yesterday,&lt;/a&gt; it was possibly even worse for Holmes. If she’s trying to convince the jury that any fraud was mostly Balwani’s fault, she’s going to have to explain the ample evidence she was giving marching orders.&lt;/p&gt;
