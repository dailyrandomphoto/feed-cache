    <title>Numbers won’t tell us when the pandemic is over</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Our emotional relationship to COVID-19 will drive our transition out of the pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="zcimDu"&gt;Courtney Gidengil has a roadmap for how the COVID-19 pandemic might end. It was sketched out the last time the United States transitioned out of a pandemic — the “swine flu” outbreaks in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEH2Sn"&gt;Gidengil, a senior physician policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, spent that pandemic asking a group of adults how worried they were about the virus. Their answers changed through the course of her &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3297965/pdf/AJPH.2011.300407.pdf"&gt;eight-month study&lt;/a&gt;. Early on, people were worried that they’d get sick, and that if they got sick, they’d die. Then, as we learned more about the virus, a flu strain called H1N1, they felt like they were less at risk. The virus was still around, but people weren’t as scared of it. Eventually, it just became one of the normal flu strains that circulate each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tWpPV"&gt;“We understand more about it, but people also just become attuned to the risk,” Gidengil says. ”It just becomes more like background noise in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i96CGB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;”It just becomes more like background noise in everyday life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="odOB5S"&gt;That emotional transition — from fear and uncertainty to gradual acclimatization — is likely to happen again with COVID-19. H1N1 is a very different disease than COVID-19; it was far less deadly and barely disrupted most people’s day-to-day lives. But it’s one way to picture what the social trajectory out of a pandemic can look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGOGtO"&gt;Right now, COVID-19 is still killing people all over the world — the pandemic is still viscerally real. But in the US, it doesn’t have the same sharp bite as it did six months ago. The end feels close: case rates have been falling for weeks, and tens of thousands of people get vaccinated each day. The virus is being beaten back unevenly all over the world, but populations will each adjust to living with the new disease as the risk of it becomes more and more tolerable — it won’t feel like it’s an emergency anymore. It’ll just be another virus that sometimes makes people sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq3Ymm"&gt;That gradual adjustment is partly why the end of the pandemic feels so slippery: there’s no one number of cases to reach or switch that will flip to mark the end. We’re not waiting for a group like the World Health Organization to say it’s over, and even if it did, that announcement wouldn’t be essential — after all, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/health/coronavirus-pandemic-gupta/index.html"&gt;some people started&lt;/a&gt; calling the outbreak a pandemic before the WHO did. In many ways, COVID-19 will stop being a pandemic disease and start being a regular disease when we feel like it has. The end will be based on people’s tolerance for risk, personal values, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/tiktok-and-the-vibes-revival"&gt;and straight vibes&lt;/a&gt; — not a hard-and-fast data point. And that transition will be different for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndLPvw"&gt;“We will be very attentive to the coronavirus for a while, and then it will enter the kind of background welter of things that kill us,” says Nicholas Christakis, a sociologist and director of the Human Nature Lab at Yale University. “Slowly, we will stop paying attention to it — that will define the social end of the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e8NHmd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A regular threat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uGhIYZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/covid-herd-immunity-vaccine.html"&gt;We probably won’t be able to get rid&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 entirely. Vaccination, improved treatments, and familiarity with the virus will defang the threat. Already, it looks like vaccinating the people at the highest risk from dying of COVID-19 has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1390681942463447048"&gt;brought down its overall fatality rate&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. But the virus will continue to circulate through the population, and eventually, the peaks and valleys of the pandemic will settle at some sort of consistent height. At that point, it will have transitioned from a &lt;em&gt;pandemic&lt;/em&gt; disease — an illness that spreads rapidly and affects the entire world — to an &lt;em&gt;endemic&lt;/em&gt; disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s98c8w"&gt;Those are specific, technical terms, but in many ways, their definitions are based on experience and emotion. Pandemic diseases are unpredictable and cause unexpected, scary amounts of death and sickness. Endemic diseases, on the other hand, are predictable. They’re a threat but a threat the population is used to. Think: seasonal flu, chicken pox, some sexually transmitted diseases, malaria in parts of Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aaJeCj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When you shift from pandemic to endemic, it means that there’s a collective acceptance that we are now living with this disease”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yDCvXF"&gt;“When you shift from pandemic to endemic, it means that there’s a collective acceptance that we are now living with this disease,” Gidengil says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vu1Zm7"&gt;Personally, I’ve spent a lot of time lately wondering what that acceptance will look like for me. I’m fully vaccinated, and so are most of my friends and family. I’ve started to ease back into “normal” activities like visiting my parents, browsing clothing stores, and making dinner with friends. But it still feels weird to take off my mask inside if there are strangers around. I still jump when someone coughs nearby. Hearing someone I know has COVID-19 would still be scary. Logically, I know my risk from COVID-19 is many times lower than it was a month ago — but that’s hard to internalize after &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yye8/pandemic-safety-mask-lockdown-cant-quit-grief-trauma-anxiety"&gt;over a year of fear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gENEF1"&gt;The adjustment to living with COVID-19 as a background threat will be different for everyone, says Steven Taylor, clinical psychologist and author of &lt;em&gt;The Psychology of Pandemics&lt;/em&gt;. People who had higher baseline levels of anxiety may take longer to adjust to a new relationship with the virus. “It’s going to be tough for some people to wrap their heads around the idea that the pandemic is over, but people are still getting sick and dying from COVID-19,” he says. On the other hand, people who normally cope well with stress will navigate the transition to having an endemic virus more easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cCpZ6"&gt;It’s worth taking a second to talk about another slippery, complex part of this discussion. Some people &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; believed that COVID-19 posed much of a threat and went about their normal lives over the past year. At that point in time, deciding to tune out COVID-19 and think of it as just a background threat wasn’t reasonable. COVID-19 was still clearly and objectively a pandemic, with soaring cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Decisions that just ignored reality were dangerous for individuals’ health, the health of others, and health systems overall. In some places in the world, COVID-19 is still a clear and present danger, and the end of the pandemic is still far away. But over 2021 and 2022, as vaccination rates go up and the levels of COVID-19 fall, the pandemic can start to become more subjective. Personal risk tolerance will play a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/05/americans-will-have-answer-remaining-questions-about-pandemic-themselves/"&gt;bigger and bigger role&lt;/a&gt; in how people manage their relationship with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New York Opens Pop-Up Vaccination Sites At MTA Stations, Offering Free Metro Cards" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcJkD8d14uVOMIh_CfI0pXSTbhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528432/1317682227.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFVCnA"&gt;“When we get to a point where we have very low levels of hospitalizations and deaths, it’s less of a public health issue,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Then, we could start to see reasonable differences in how people navigate their changing relationship with COVID-19. Some people might still want to avoid any situations where they could be exposed to the coronavirus. Others might be willing to risk it for the chance to go to an indoor concert, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ivhyG"&gt;Making that choice might feel similar to the choice to get into a car, even though there’s a high risk of an accident. “We look at the risk of getting into a car accident as worth it because of the value that transportation by motor vehicles brings to our lives,” Nuzzo says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ua58cH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An uncertain timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TLVjG2"&gt;There’s no playbook for how the adjustment period from pandemic to background, endemic threat will go or for how long it could take. Gidengil’s research showed that H1N1 stopped feeling like a pandemic over the course of a few months, but that virus was never as scary as COVID-19. HIV offers another example, Taylor says — it still circulates and is still dangerous, but when effective treatments were developed, the anxiety around it started to fade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNAQus"&gt;Even with treatments, though, that adjustment to HIV took years, says Yale sociologist Christakis. “People stopped thinking about it as much, but there wasn’t a rapid decline in the public consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="edli2t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the emergence of viral variants might make the adjustment process bumpier than the arc of H1N1&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b7Gcm0"&gt;It’s still unclear how that will play out with COVID-19. The emergence of viral variants might make the adjustment process bumpier than the arc of H1N1 —  while H1N1 faded quickly, new variants of the coronavirus might raise public concerns at uneven intervals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oiw2Qj"&gt;As cases fall and vaccinations increase, policy changes may influence how people feel about the virus. Local and federal health agencies could decide to only report new COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, rather than every single new case, Nuzzo says. That could signal to people that each individual case isn’t as much of a threat. Changes in mask mandates also give people cues. We’ve seen that recently with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s mask guidelines for people who are fully vaccinated. Telling people that they can stop wearing masks in certain situations indicates that they can start to let their guard down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SB2ARV"&gt;Still, policy doesn’t always dictate people’s relationships with COVID-19. In some areas, vaccinated people may be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/nyregion/vaccinated-masks-cdc.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;sticking to masks&lt;/a&gt;, even where the CDC and local regulations say they’re no longer necessary. “I think it’s ultimately going to matter how comfortable people feel,” Nuzzo says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CgiJvT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That comfort will come with time — and with familiarity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ylGol"&gt;That comfort will come with time — and with familiarity. My brother had COVID-19 this spring. He recovered just fine, but he was undeniably sick for around a week — no appetite, a high fever, a horrible sore throat, unable to get out of bed. He’s young, and he was never in any serious danger, but it was still scary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjntVh"&gt;If a family member got sick a year from now, Taylor thinks I probably wouldn’t be as worried. That hypothetical family member would probably be vaccinated, and we’d have another year of information about the virus. I’d also have a year of stories about people who caught COVID-19 and didn’t become seriously ill, because the vaccines are so good at preventing bad cases of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMxWFq"&gt;Calm “comes from experience,” Taylor says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kvQlsR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blind spots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bhsk9X"&gt;Calm can also be dangerous. The trouble with marking the end of pandemics by how they feel instead of by a concrete metric is that we might set the bar for what feels like normal in an uncomfortable place. “At a certain point, there’s a concern that people might underestimate the risk,” Gidengil says. “Diseases come under control, so there is less risk, but we want to attune it so we’re at the sweet spot of understanding what the risk is so that we can make well-informed decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVCUXD"&gt;She saw that with H1N1. Toward the end of that pandemic, as people’s fear of the virus started to let up, Gidengil’s research showed that the number of people who wanted to get the H1N1 vaccine started to drop. The virus seemed like less of a threat, and people felt like it was less urgent to take steps that would protect them from it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fumigation machines are part of campaigns against malaria in India. Endemic diseases like malaria are extremely dangerous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgOhXV"&gt;But endemic diseases, even though they seem less acutely scary, are still dangerous. Seasonal flu kills thousands of people a year in the United States. Malaria is a leading cause of death in countries where it’s endemic. Our collective anxiety might fade, but the virus will still be a clear risk. The level of regularly circulating coronavirus will layer on top of the other circulating diseases. It’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21378046/covid-19-long-term-hospital-survellience-adjustments"&gt;raise the baseline number&lt;/a&gt; of people who get sick and die each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aa9bL5"&gt;“Another killer has been added to the list of things that kill us,” Christakis says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gW8jr0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Another killer has been added to the list of things that kill us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QBNK8y"&gt;Right now, around 600 people a day are dying from COVID-19 in the United States. If that was the average background level of disease, it’d mean something like an additional 200,000 deaths from infectious diseases each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDh156"&gt;Feeling our way toward the social end of the pandemic in the US also risks turning on blinders to the way COVID-19 could continue to burn through the rest of the world. The vaccine rollout is devastatingly unequal — high-income countries locked down &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/coronavirus-vaccine-inequality-global/"&gt;over half&lt;/a&gt; of the world’s doses, and poorer countries likely won’t be able to immunize their populations for years. Low rates of COVID-19 in the US could create an illusion of security, but outbreaks around the world mean persistent risk. “I don’t think it’s fully safe for the US while the rest of the world suffers,” Nuzzo says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VURyhV"&gt;Luckily, we have a stake and some control over how the transition toward the end of the pandemic happens. Communities and their public health leadership can decide that they don’t want to normalize tens of thousands of additional deaths. They can invest money and effort and time into smothering the virus as much as possible. They can decide to say that the pandemic isn’t over in one country until it’s over everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CraWqq"&gt;COVID-19 isn’t going anywhere, Christakis says. “The virus is just going to keep searching for victims.” Pandemics can’t last forever, and danger doesn’t always feel like an emergency. But the number of people we’re willing to lose to the virus without alarm bells ringing is up to us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xnudd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gcyBW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ig94_fqNQBXgc2SfQyCwz6Qs2P8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318686/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ikMud"&gt;Sony’s elusive PlayStation 5 console is in stock at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re one of the many people who has struggled to get one for yourself, today is looking good for you, and it’ll look better if more retailers jump in with stock later today. As usual, Walmart might not immediately appear to be selling consoles today, but you might be able to get one added to your cart if you refresh frequently. (&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: make sure your payment method and shipping address are entered ahead of time on each site before you try to buy a console. The faster you can checkout, the more likely your chance of success. Also, Walmart tends to release more consoles in 10-minute waves, so try again if 3:00PM ET doesn’t work, try again at 3:10PM ET.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpQGVG"&gt;The PS5 with a UHD Blu-ray disc drive and 1TB of built-in SSD storage costs $499.99 and is available from Walmart. Due to the disc drive, this model is slightly thicker and heavier than the digital edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AN08xm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQnMrc"&gt;If you want to save a little money (and a little space in your entertainment center), the PlayStation 5 digital edition without a disc drive is available for $399.99. Other than lacking the ability to play discs, this model is exactly the same as the more costly version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZVc8fy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFbGOe"&gt;I wish you the best of luck in getting a console today. Whether you get one today, or plan to get one when the next restocking happens, there are a few must-have accessories to accompany your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9pnh2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="z6YELL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="OlxFkn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="utPhLC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ceREf8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack had some problems on Thursday for more than an hour</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pueWRGSomJe0poqIhJ3iBDk2g2c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318276/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3VQ0J5"&gt;Slack experienced frustrating issues for many on Thursday, including for some of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. For me, some messages just wouldn’t send. But a little more than an hour after Slack first reported the outage, the company said that the issues were resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSRGX4"&gt;“We’ve released a fix for this issue, and Slack is up and running once again,” &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-05/33aed870657e30a0"&gt;Slack said in a post on its status site&lt;/a&gt; at 2:36PM ET. “If you are still experiencing any trouble, please fully quit your Slack app or browser using Command + Q (Mac) or Ctrl + Q (Windows/Linux), and then reopen it.” Slack first posted about the outage at 1:17PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtTWIW"&gt;The next time there’s a Slack outage, I highly recommend you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=slack%20down&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;cruise Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to see the ridiculous &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NyloAndry/status/1395436475815243782"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swainsch/status/1395436446337703939"&gt;GIFs&lt;/a&gt; that people post. You might not be able to work anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KMvFK"&gt;Slack also went down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213105/slack-outage-down-2021-server-error"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; on the first full work day of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBEvZn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 20th, 2:46PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Slack confirmed that the outage has been fixed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Ford’s F-150 Lightning stacks up against the Tesla Cybertruck and Hummer EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tACxlwQTQ5Ry_1-L1BmGFleEIZQ=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318558/3_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z71ovA"&gt;Ford has revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;its first all-electric F-150&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning, and on paper it looks like a really compelling truck. It’s priced aggressively for an electric vehicle, has plenty of power, and looks to be more capable at towing and hauling than the cheapest gas-powered F-150s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9YmLm"&gt;But Ford’s not alone in developing an electric pickup truck — far from it, in fact. There is a slew of electric pickups set to hit the market in the next year and a half or so. Tesla’s polarizing Cybertruck should start rolling off the line at the company’s new Texas factory at the end of 2021 or in early 2022. Rivian — a startup that has raised billions of dollars and is backed by Amazon and Ford — has an electric pickup called the R1T due out this June. And General Motors’ first electric pickup will be the gaudy Hummer, which the company has revived after a decade. That’s due out in late 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1PrEgC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford F-150 Lightning revealed: an electric truck for the masses","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9srBm3"&gt;The most interesting thing about these pickup trucks is perhaps not just that they’re electric. It’s that they’re all quite different from each other. Tesla’s Cybertruck is a radical rethink of a truck’s exterior design and body structure. The R1T is one of the most refined pickups ever made for off-roading. The Hummer is... well there’s not much the Hummer pickup &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt;. The F-150 Lightning is about as straightforward as it gets — which is unsurprising for an electric version of the most popular vehicle in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SsTItf"&gt;Despite the diverse designs, all four of these electric trucks are going to court buyers who want to do Truck Stuff with them, meaning stats like power, torque, towing and hauling capacity, and of course, range will be crucial considerations (along with price). Here’s how they stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gZWJ0s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10510162"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YXJi46"&gt;Ford’s electric pickup is really price competitive with the Cybertruck, though Tesla promises much more range and performance at the higher ends. The two designs could not be more different, but they track the closest, spec-wise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrXiTl"&gt;The electric Hummer pickup truck outclasses both of those in a lot of ways (like max horsepower and torque), but it costs as much as a house, so it better. Rivian’s premium pickup is right in the middle, with some really good performance promised at a more digestible price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKbgw8"&gt;There are others on the horizon, to be sure, but they’re either too far away to consider right now or there’s just not enough detail about them to properly stack them up. General Motors has committed to making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370058/gm-chevy-electric-silverado-pickup-truck"&gt;an electric Chevy Silverado&lt;/a&gt;, though it doesn’t have a release date yet. Michigan startup Bollinger has spent years teasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930252/bollinger-motors-electric-trucks-b1-b2-trucks-price-specs"&gt;boxy electric work truck&lt;/a&gt; (plus a few variants) but still does not have a clear path to production. Lordstown Motors has a pickup truck slated for production at the end of this year, but it’s exclusively for fleets (and the company still has to finish a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of real-world testing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnntS4"&gt;Meanwhile, one of the most compelling things about the F-150 Lightning is that it stacks up really well against its gas-powered siblings — especially because Ford is only selling it in a four-door SuperCrew configuration to start, which is its most expensive cab layout. Here’s a snapshot of the Lightning up against the cheapest gas-powered SuperCrew F-150 and the hybrid F-150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g2sksC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10510467"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkROD1"&gt;The base Lightning obviously can’t compete with the ability to go nearly 500 miles on a tank of gas or nearly 800 miles in the hybrid. But Ford has packed the electric F-150 with a lot of really compelling features — like a gigantic front trunk, tons of onboard power for running tools or even your home in a pinch — and has made its all-wheel drive standard. How many buyers will those features sway? We’ll have to wait until 2022 to find out. But Ford has already &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/20/ford-already-has-20000-reservations-for-new-electric-f-150-lightning-pickup-.html"&gt;taken more than 20,000 $100 deposits&lt;/a&gt; for the electric F-150, so it’s off to a pretty good start. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap’s new Spectacles let you see the world in augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a woman wearing the fourth-gen Spectacles, which are black with angular frames." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TRdQFrgKF_-Q6eS-tXq0cVd9L0=/120x0:1740x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318328/Spectacles_KatVHarris_Portrait.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap’s fourth-generation Spectacles. | Photo: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bdAtUx"&gt;Snap’s new Spectacles glasses are its most ambitious yet. But there’s a big catch: you can’t buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KyxKs"&gt;On Thursday, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel unveiled the company’s first true augmented reality glasses, technology that he and rivals like Facebook think will one day be as ubiquitous as mobile phones. A demo showed virtual butterflies fluttering over colorful plants and landing in Spiegel’s extended hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ye9Tqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The next generation of Spectacles can help unlock a new way to use AR hands-free”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a6OcHH"&gt;The new Spectacles have dual waveguide displays capable of superimposing AR effects made with Snapchat’s software tools. The frame features four built-in microphones, two stereo speakers, and a built-in touchpad. Front-facing cameras help the glasses detect objects and surfaces you’re looking at so that graphics more naturally interact with the world around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nghss"&gt;These Spectacles, however, aren’t ready for the mass market. Unlike past models, Snap isn’t selling them. Instead, it’s giving them directly to an undisclosed number of AR effects creators through an application program online. (Another indication they aren’t ready for everyday use: the battery only lasts 30 minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="OBlzSP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tapping the vast potential of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snap?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Snap&lt;/a&gt;’s AR platform, the next generation of Spectacles allow you to overlay Lenses directly onto the world in front of you, for an immersive AR experience. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SnapPartnerSummit?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SnapPartnerSummit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/r4XnSC886z"&gt;https://t.co/r4XnSC886z&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/UTDDoxwBOO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UTDDoxwBOO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spectacles (@Spectacles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spectacles/status/1395439601590833156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbMbFD"&gt;The idea is to encourage a small portion of the 200,000 people who already make AR effects in Snapchat to experiment with creating experiences for the new Spectacles, according to Spiegel. Like the bright yellow vending machines Snap used to sell the first version of Spectacles several years ago, the approach could end up being a clever way to build buzz for the glasses ahead of their wide release. Spiegel has said that AR glasses will take roughly a decade to reach mainstream adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAteAd"&gt;“I don’t believe the phone is going away,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview this week. “I just think that the next generation of Spectacles can help unlock a new way to use AR hands-free, and the ability to really roam around with your eyes looking up at the horizon, out at the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSRl6D"&gt;The first two generations of Spectacles, released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13671164/snapchat-spectacles-glasses-review-camera-sunglasses"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17279434/snapchat-spectacles-pricing-availability-snap-wearable-camera"&gt; and 2018&lt;/a&gt;, looked like sunglasses with a single camera in the corner of the frame. They let you snap videos (and later photos) in a unique, spherical format that could then be transferred to your phone and posted to Snapchat or another social network.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Above: Snap’s new fourth-generation Spectacles. Lower: the Spectacles in their case, and a side-view showing their touch panel. Images: Snap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="533QIv"&gt;Snap, which calls itself a camera company, started moving more toward AR in 2019 with the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20951783/snap-spectacles-3-review-snapchat-glasses-price-specs-features"&gt;its third-generation Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;. That model added a second camera to detect depth in videos, allowing for more advanced effects to be applied afterward. But they lacked displays. You had to shoot a video, import it to Snapchat, and then apply AR effects — which Snap calls Lenses — later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJNBhW"&gt;The new fourth generation of Spectacles come from a secretive hardware division of the company called Snap Lab, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-plans-hardware-push-with-ar-spectacles-drone"&gt;also working on a camera drone&lt;/a&gt;. They weigh 134 grams, more than double the weight of the previous version but far less than Microsoft’s Hololens AR headset. They’re designed to be worn indoors or outdoors with up to 2,000 nits of display brightness, a tradeoff the company clearly made to favor display richness at the expense of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20lfrb"&gt;Two front-facing cameras use the software Snap built for its mobile phone Lenses to automatically detect physical surfaces and place effects in a way that doesn’t obstruct the real world. Two stereo speakers capture audio and allow for the wearer to control them by voice. A touchpad on the side of the frame operates an interface in the displays that Snap calls the Lens Carousel, allowing the wearer to switch AR effects they’re seeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Above: two images show AR effects as seen through the new glasses. Lower: the lens carousel interface lets you select different AR effects. Images: Snap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bLrnr"&gt;The new Spectacles were announced Thursday at Snap’s virtual Partner Summit for developers, where the company previewed a number of new augmented reality features for Snapchat. Its AR clothing try-on tech can now handle watches and glasses, and businesses will be able to more easily add AR versions of their online catalogs for Snapchat’s 500 million monthly users to try and purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xEuxm5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have to invent a whole new way of interacting with computing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hqFAym"&gt;A new feature, called Connected Lenses, allows multiple people to see and interact with the same scene in AR. Snap is also launching an AR “innovation lab” called Ghost and is committing $3.5 million to support creators making effects, with another $1 million in funding with Verizon to fund AR experiences used over 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CtqbE"&gt;While Snap is known primarily for the Snapchat app now, these Spectacles indicate how the company’s ambition is to be a major player in the race to build AR glasses. Facebook, Apple, and other tech giants are currently working on their competing devices. Facebook plans to debut its own pair of smart glasses in partnership with RayBan later this year, though they won’t feature AR displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpUuqQ"&gt;According to Spiegel, head-worn devices like these new Spectacles will create a big shift in how we interact with computers. While Snap is betting that millions of people will eventually want to wear Spectacles, the company is content for now to build in public alongside its creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9FQrE"&gt;“You have to invent a whole new way of interacting with computing when it’s volumetric and integrated with the space around you,” Spiegel said. “So I don’t see Snapchat transitioning to wearables that directly, but one of the things that’s really fun is to think about what the new interaction paradigms can look like.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat gets augmented reality Legos you can build with a friend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zpLTPTWVk2iK-lUo9DrRKuKWo8=/158x0:1781x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318239/Screen_Shot_2021_05_20_at_9.31.31_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zQhWLk"&gt;Snapchat is introducing a new type of augmented reality lens, called “Connected Lenses,” which allows Snapchat users to connect and enjoy an AR experience or game together — even if they’re not in the same physical space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehdjnl"&gt;The company is partnering with Lego for its first Connected Lens, which allows users to build a Lego model in augmented reality together, whether that’s in the same room or through the internet from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eWUwt4SZjBng6BSaAyQ-CWQhwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528419/Screen_Shot_2021_05_20_at_9.30.58_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WMo2N9"&gt;In the demo video that Snap showed off, both users see the same floating Lego model on a table in their respective homes and can add parts, effects, and animations to the model, which are reflected for both users in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ST47nH"&gt;The move marks Snap’s latest expansion of augmented reality lenses, which include the popular photo filter lenses, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294062/snapchat-landmarkers-ar-lenses-filters-eiffel-tower-rainbows"&gt;company’s “Landmarker” lenses&lt;/a&gt; for interacting with famous landmarks in AR, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17551428/snapchat-lens-explorer-community-filters"&gt;the community-sourced Lens Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHMRSH"&gt;Creators will also be able to build new Connected Lenses using Snap’s Lens Studio. The new multiperson Lego Lens should be available soon on Lego’s Snapchat profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49LZid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap will launch a standalone iOS video editing app called Story Studio later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ECWt6q7FFJPf0d1Z0j43WzVMX5c=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318136/Story_Studio_GIF.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap’s forthcoming iOS app Story Studio will allow people to handle more complicated videos edits from their mobile device. | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CENQ6T"&gt;Snap wants to be the company people think of when they go to edit videos on mobile, so during its annual partnership summit today, the company announced a new iOS app that’ll help it achieve that goal: Story Studio. It’ll give people editing tools specifically designed for mobile, or vertical, videos. The app will pull data from Snapchat and its new Spotlight feature, more familiarly recognized as its TikTok competitor, to help people figure out how and what to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Afq8Kr"&gt;They can look through Snapchat insights, like what’s trending on the app across sounds, hashtags, and lenses. Lenses will be built directly into Story Studio, as well as Snapchat Sounds and stickers, so editors can add those. Of course, like most other video editing apps, users can trim their videos and edit frame by frame. They can then share directly to Snapchat through a built-in button, or download their work to publish in other apps. Notably, content made in Story Studio won’t include a watermark, meaning if it’s published on other platforms, like Instagram’s Reels, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;won’t be demoted&lt;/a&gt; by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9l0wnH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YDx3zJ-3-I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saNyuM"&gt;The app will roll out later this year, and the company didn’t share any other details about a possible Android version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn2pNs"&gt;Additionally today, Snap provided updates on Spotlight. For one, it’s making it easier for video editors to upload content they made in more advanced desktop apps, like Final Cut Pro. Spotlight content can now be uploaded, and watched, through the web at &lt;a href="http://snapchat.com/spotlight"&gt;snapchat.com/spotlight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FHFZDnRdgaXqUH7lX1T8BemNPog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527733/Spotlight_Web_Upload.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snapchat is making it easier for people to upload Spotlight content. Now they can do so through their desktop computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4EJ0ke"&gt;Finally, Snap also added that it would no longer be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;distributing $1 million per day&lt;/a&gt; to its top Spotlight creators. Instead, starting June 1st, it’ll distribute millions per month and didn’t specify exactly how much. The amount creators receive will be based on the engagement their posts receive, as it is now, and there’s no set limit on the number of people who can get paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzlmSC"&gt;This could be a potentially big deal for the company as it heralds Spotlight as a major success. Some teens &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/style/snapchat-spotlight.html"&gt;became nearly overnight millionaires&lt;/a&gt;, and Snap &lt;a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Snap-Inc.-Q1-2021-Transcript.pdf"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; over 125 million used the feature in March. At the same time, Snap also says more than 500 million people are now monthly active users, which it announced today. It’s possible Spotlight had a hand in this growth, but the number of people logging on might decrease when the promise of a million distributed dollars per day disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC reduces out-of-state prison phone rates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Qg4lsb33xYuaGoVcChD2G2PkE0=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318064/phone1_1020.1419979655.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;phone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eC5vuf"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously Thursday to lower some of the rates incarcerated people and their families pay to speak over the phone. For jurisdictional reasons, the measure only applies to interstate or international calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKH5vc"&gt;The Commission approved a measure that prohibits companies like Global Tel Link and Pay Tel Communications from charging families and incarcerated people more than 12 cents a minute in large prisons and 14 cents a minute in large jails for out-of-state calls. Previously, rates were capped at 21 cents a minute and single conversations could total several dollars. The action also caps international calling services for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyZXS6"&gt;“Recognizing the exigent circumstances caused by the pandemic, we lower interim interstate rates for prisons and the largest jails,” Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Thursday. “This means that interstate rates will fall by more than a third for the vast majority of those who are incarcerated. For the first time ever, we cap international rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG2XtL"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/prison-phone-call-cost-martha-wright-v-corrections-corporation-america"&gt;criminal justice advocates have fought&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the exorbitant costs of phone calls in prisons. The FCC attempted to set similar rules lowering costs for &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/337593-court-strikes-down-in-state-prison-call-rates"&gt;intrastate calls in 2017&lt;/a&gt; but was overturned by a DC Circuit ruling. As a result, its current jurisdiction only applies to calls that cross state or national borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6yldd"&gt;A confluence of alleged “monopoly” power and lucrative financial arrangements between prisons and telecom companies are at the root of the expensive phone rates in prisons. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/income.html"&gt;the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of families go into debt due to high phone rates with incarcerated loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpwtDh"&gt;Lawmakers like Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Rob Portman (R-OH) have &lt;a href="https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/news/press-releases/duckworth-portman-booker-schatz-markey-and-king-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-address-predatory-phone-rates-in-criminal-justice-system"&gt;introduced legislation&lt;/a&gt; that would provide the FCC more authority to lower in-state prison phone rates, but it’s unclear if the bill will be passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHOqFE"&gt;“There is more we can do. Because as a matter of social justice we are not yet where we need to be,” Rosenworcel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCCWT8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dvcG1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are bidding millions for the first ride on Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ng8ZFq4k7jyuZtRKCuAplhiN5UY=/263x0:3089x1884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317881/BlueOrigin_NS15_06_CapsuleDescent.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mWAE8b"&gt;Rich people are jockeying for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard mission, bidding as high as $2.8 million for a ten-minute experience at the edge of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuOvvy"&gt;A single seat aboard the New Shepard crew capsule, dubbed the RSS First Step Crew Capsule, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420709/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-tickets-astronaut"&gt;went up for auction&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, starting with a sealed bidding round that drew “more than 5,200 bidders from 136 countries,” the company said in a statement yesterday. By Wednesday morning, when the auction’s open-bidding phase began, the highest bid was revealed: $1.4 million. It rose to $2.8 million by the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwZhXP"&gt;RSS First Step, a gumdrop-shaped pod with seats for six, is getting set to fly its inaugural crew sometime in the next six months, with one seat reserved for the winning bidder and the rest for company-selected passengers. Proceeds from the auction will go to Blue Origin’s &lt;a href="https://clubforfuture.org/"&gt;philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, Club for the Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XX4GcF"&gt;The company hasn’t revealed the ticket price for a seat — but through the auction, it’s getting a good idea of who the potential customers are and what they’re willing to pay. “Let’s say, the most active bidders, they’re gonna be very clear on our radar, so when we do go to open up those tickets, we’ll know who to go to contact,” Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s astronaut sales director, said earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEwq1SgsFyi-4LtymTslfpDlYcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528283/BlueOrigin_NS15_03_WindowView.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;POV from inside Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PSiUcn"&gt;After this debut crewed mission in the coming months, more will follow, the company has said. From a desert in Texas, Blue Origin’s reusable 60-foot-tall New Shepard booster will launch the capsule roughly 65 miles into the sky past the Kármán Line, the internationally recognized boundary of Earth’s outermost atmosphere. The trip promises stunning views of Earth and the potential for passengers to experience the “&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/HWHAP/the-overview-effect"&gt;overview effect&lt;/a&gt;,” a feeling described by astronauts as a shift in awareness of Earth when seeing it from space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5IjeC"&gt;You’d need to drop a few stacks for that overview effect, though. The open-bidding phase for New Shepard’s seat closes on June 10th and enters a live, online auction round on Saturday, June 12th. “Participants must raise their bid limit by June 10 at 5 p.m. EDT to participate in the June 12 live auction,” a Blue Origin spokeswoman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HR12a6"&gt;The highest bid price is updated live on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;. The number increases in increments of 10 percent, according to a person working at RR Auction Company, the Boston, Massachusetts-based firm managing the auction for Blue Origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymNoUB"&gt;The space company has test flown New Shepard 15 times so far without people on board, with the most recent flight serving as “a verification step for the vehicle and operations prior to flying astronauts.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get ready for a busy Atlantic hurricane season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nicaragua Prepares To Receive Hurricane Iota" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6yupZOumAwIVbrsYEMhf6Cr3pY=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317799/1286039153.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;PUERTO CABEZAS, NICARAGUA - NOVEMBER 16: Palm trees blow by wind as Nicaragua prepares to receive hurricane Iota on November 16, 2020 in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Less than two weeks after being hardly affected by Hurricane Eta, villagers of Puerto Cabezas take precautions before landfall of Iota.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Maynor Valenzuela/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aJmiq"&gt;The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be busier than average. There’s a 60 percent chance of an above-normal season this year. Up to 20 named storms and as many as 10 hurricanes are expected, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; published today by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They also forecast up to 5 major hurricanes, which have&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;winds reaching 111 mph or higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srh3is"&gt;Hurricane season officially starts on June 1st. But for the first time this year, NOAA began issuing routine Tropical Weather Outlooks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307511/atlantic-hurricane-season-start-two-weeks-early-may"&gt;two weeks early&lt;/a&gt;. More storms have developed ahead of the official&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;season in recent years, to the point where NOAA and the World Meteorological Organization are &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/hurricane-committee-discusses-record-breaking-2020-season-plans-2021"&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; moving the official start date of the season up to May 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E2VaAo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“New normals” brought on by climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6LF0R"&gt;This all reflects “new normals” brought on by climate change.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Every ten years, using data from weather stations, NOAA &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/new-us-climate-normals-are-here-what-do-they-tell-us-about-climate-change"&gt;updates the 30-year climate record&lt;/a&gt; it uses to determine what’s considered “normal.” Using that data, NOAA recently &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/average-atlantic-hurricane-season-to-reflect-more-storms"&gt;raised the bar&lt;/a&gt; for what’s considered a typical number of storms in a single season. The average is now 14 named storms and seven hurricanes in a season. Prior to that update, an average season had 12 named storms and six hurricanes. The new numbers reflect how much the world has already changed over the past decade, as well as technological advances that help meteorologists better detect storms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JkPik"&gt;“Now is the time to ensure that you have an evacuation plan in place, disaster supplies on hand, and a plan to secure your home quickly,” acting NOAA Administrator Benjamin Friedman said in a press briefing today. “It was a mere six months ago that the most active Atlantic season on record ended, and here we are now on the cusp of a new hurricane season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAwWPQ"&gt;In true 2020 fashion, last year’s Atlantic hurricane season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;was terrible&lt;/a&gt;. Coastal communities reeled under repeated blows — Louisiana faced five named storms while Central America was hard-hit by Hurricanes Eta and Iota in quick succession. A whopping 30 storms grew strong enough to earn a name, and thirteen of those intensified into hurricanes. That was even more than the &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/extremely-active-hurricane-season-possible-for-atlantic-basin"&gt;“extremely active” season NOAA forecasted&lt;/a&gt;. They’d expected more storms because a climate pattern called &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html"&gt;La Niña&lt;/a&gt; developed, which can lead to more hurricanes in the Atlantic. NOAA said that La Niña could develop again later in the season, although the agency doesn’t expect this year to be as bad as last season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xqcLpF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Those trends raise the risk that these storms pose to people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7W5Bq"&gt;The jury is still out on whether climate change makes storms more frequent — but there is &lt;a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/"&gt;evidence that they’re growing stronger&lt;/a&gt;. Hurricanes are also &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/08/climate-change-is-causing-more-rapid-intensification-of-atlantic-hurricanes/?utm_campaign=Climate%20Signals%20Hurricanes&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=96891550&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_LJF2deWCaYUZclLL9HaaH6whOQ6hlphxMGhPyGuzDN_Znd7dxHa6N-XFGWi1P6LJQw-kVwNcIH0ZvnvreeVctQzsoNCcTYqIsUduhDin-2TZmfVU&amp;amp;utm_content=96891550&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;intensifying more rapidly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560182/hurricane-strength-landfall-inland-climate-change-nature-study"&gt;keeping more of their strength&lt;/a&gt; upon making landfall. Those trends raise the risk that these storms pose to people, since they give communities less time to prepare and can reach farther inland. Tropical storms draw their strength from the sea’s heat energy. Hotter global temperatures translate to warmer seas and, consequently, more heat energy for storms to tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTTbZx"&gt;Forecasts made last month by Colorado State University (CSU) and IBM’s The Weather Company also predicted a busy season. &lt;a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html"&gt;CSU expects&lt;/a&gt; 17 named storms while the &lt;a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2021-05-12-atlantic-hurricane-season-outlook-2021-may-twc"&gt;The Weather Company forecast&lt;/a&gt; 19. They both expect eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes to develop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gm1inr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMmDq0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
