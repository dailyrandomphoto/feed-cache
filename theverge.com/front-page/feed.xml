    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ebsx0K"&gt;VanMoof just raised another $128 million in funding, after announcing a $40 million investment round in September 2020. That brings Amsterdam-based VanMoof’s total haul to $182 million raised in the last two years, excluding crowdfunding rounds in 2018 and 2019, making it “the most funded e-bike company in the world,” &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-GB/202064-vanmoof-raises-128m-to-make-its-high-tech-e-bikes-the-new-standard-in-cities-worldwide"&gt;according to VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2hBGy"&gt;The company claims to have almost 200,000 bikes on the road currently, with the goal of getting 10 million people on VanMoof e-bikes in the next five years. Such aggressive expansion goals require significant capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vuED3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Improve the quality and reliability of the bike&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="940gwS"&gt;VanMoof’s new funding round has been earmarked to expand production and to “reinvent the way in which hardware and software components are made,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-GB/202064-vanmoof-raises-128m-to-make-its-high-tech-e-bikes-the-new-standard-in-cities-worldwide"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the new investment round. More specifically, VanMoof co-founder Taco Carlier tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a phone interview that most of the funds will go towards R&amp;amp;D, “having more people on the hardware and software development in order to improve the quality and reliability of the bike.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbRi0G"&gt;Last September, the company said it was using about a third of its $40 million investment round to improve after-sales support that had faltered under the strain of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;troubled launch of its S3 and X3 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; during a pandemic. That money is already being used to expand the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-GB/197430-vanmoof-announces-global-service-expansion-across-50-cities"&gt;dedicated service hubs from 8 to 50 worldwide cities&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021, and develop a “Bike Doctor Network” that sends support technicians directly to customer locations when service is needed. Today’s investment round will allow for more service hubs and branded stores in (a few) more cities, according to Carlier, while paying for the rollout of the Bike Doctor Network to those cities starting in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBErDa"&gt;For comparison, RadPower, the largest e-bike maker in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;raised $150 million earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, adding to the $25 million it garnered the year prior. Investors are pouring money into electric bike makers in the hope of capitalizing on the global e-bike market which is expected to be worth almost &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/06/2204781/0/en/Global-e-bike-market-size-to-reach-USD-48-46-billion-by-2028.html"&gt;$50 billion by 2028&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2021, e-bikes already represented 17 percent of all bicycle sales in Europe, and accounted for more than 50 percent of all new bikes sales in countries like Germany and the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBV3qq"&gt;E-bike sales in the US are also on the rise. As of April, sales were up 139 percent to $681 million for the year-to-date, compared to the same period in 2020, according to market research firm NPD Group. VanMoof says that the US is its fastest growth market, “with the post-pandemic e-bike wave showing no sign of slowing down.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is kicking unsupported PCs out of Windows 11 testing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zODPjlEqGOmHbnnA1pGBcwDgiy8=/50x0:1550x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801954/windows11stock.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Windows 11 is launching on October 5th. | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3UAaC"&gt;Microsoft is starting to drop PCs from its Windows Insider testing program that are ineligible to upgrade to Windows 11. If you’ve been helping Microsoft test Windows 11 on a machine that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware requirements, you’ll likely see a message in Windows Update warning that you’ll need to reinstall Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uAx7H"&gt;“Your PC does not meet the minimum hardware requirements for Windows 11,” says Microsoft’s warning. “Your device is not eligible to join the Windows Insider Program on Windows 11. Please install Windows 10 to participate in the Windows Insider Program in the Release Preview Channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1oThq"&gt;Windows 11 testers in both the Dev and Beta channels have started receiving the message on incompatible PCs this week, just as Microsoft has announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;October 5th release date&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming OS. It’s something that Microsoft warned testers would happen at the beginning of the beta period of Windows 11, but it still highlights the often confusing minimum hardware requirements that Microsoft has set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9uUMSX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft has now dropped ineligible systems from the Insider program and tells them to install Windows 10. &lt;a href="https://t.co/zfALanmcuq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zfALanmcuq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— BetaWiki (@BetaWiki) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BetaWiki/status/1432806974022995971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o5Li6C"&gt;Windows 11 testers that have been running the OS on unsupported hardware will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes"&gt;be able to use a workaround&lt;/a&gt; to install an ISO version of the final release. But Microsoft warns that devices in this unsupported state won’t be eligible for Windows Updates, and that could include security patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErthgY"&gt;Microsoft recommends that Windows 11 testers that don’t meet the hardware minimums should install Windows 10, as this OS will be supported until 2025. Many Windows 11 testers, who are often loyal Microsoft enthusiasts, will still be left confused why their PC isn’t officially supported even though it has likely been running the OS just fine for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jc3qJ"&gt;Microsoft has attempted to justify its Windows 11 minimum hardware requirements around a push for security and reliability, but it still leaves some PCs sold just a few years ago from being able to upgrade. Windows 11 raises the baseline of security to the CPU level, and Microsoft has been clear it wants to enforce or support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;Trusted Platform Module (TPM)&lt;/a&gt;, UEFI Secure Boot, and virtualization-based security methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Nlkn8"&gt;Windows 11 will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;now arrive on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft will continue to release new Dev builds of the OS to testers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650000/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support"&gt;Android app integration isn’t arriving at launch&lt;/a&gt; but Windows Insider testers will get access in the coming months to the feature which relies heavily on modern hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midrange Samsung Galaxy S21 FE appears again in leaked manual</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pZZyie-EG6IUu6-eJO8tlaTIF0E=/1x0:1147x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801948/msedge_cwyTkgz4Rn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the unannounced phone from the leaked manual.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l" target="_blank"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qYtVdr"&gt;A user manual for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 FE (aka “Fan Edition”) has been &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-5g-user-manual-makes-no-mention-of-microsd-slot/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_CNo4aG0QZ2u7M8IsX0IwJps0YlMeItRJH4K0Ll1_CzQ-1630443096-0-gqNtZGzNArujcnBszQ0l"&gt;published online by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving us another look at the unannounced midrange counterpart to the company’s Galaxy S21 flagship. As you’d expect from a manual, the document spends more time outlining how to use the phone than it does describing its specs, but it’s a guide for what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHbW9V"&gt;For starters, images included in the manual appear to confirm that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1400945475558199298"&gt;previously leaked renders&lt;/a&gt; are accurate. That means we’re looking at a similar design to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;, albeit seemingly with a less premium finish. Three cameras are shown on the S21 FE’s rear while on the front there’s an in-display fingerprint scanner and a hole-punch notch for a selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-XbCbJJT3RrrhDqLSUVxy0rvuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819522/msedge_K8x7I5KuYH.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One section of the manual describe’s the phone’s reverse wireless charging feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9wSAPz"&gt;Other details mentioned in the manual include an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, an ultra-wide camera, and support for Samsung’s Wireless DeX software to allow the phone to mirror its display to supported TVs and use its screen as a touchpad. There’s no sign of a headphone jack, microSD card slot (which appeared on last year’s S20 FE), or an included charging brick in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncznlI"&gt;In terms of specs, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that previous rumors claim the phone will be powered by a Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 processor depending on the market, which would put it roughly in line with the Galaxy S21 flagship from earlier this year. Its battery is expected to have a capacity of 4,500mAh, with support for 25W fast charging and reverse wireless charging also mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2SlIL"&gt;The question now is when, if ever, we might see the phone officially announced. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung was forced to deny reports&lt;/a&gt; that it had cancelled production of the unannounced phone due to production difficulties caused by the global chip shortage. The emergence of a user manual suggests the phone will see an official release, though it doesn’t outright confirm it. For reference, last year’s Galaxy S20 FE was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451701/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-price-release-date-specs-features"&gt;announced on September 23rd&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of its release on October 2nd, suggesting we might not have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internet shutdowns by governments have ‘proliferated at a truly alarming pace’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FWbqJUz8ajVnwFEKZBcj_8REK4k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801939/jbareham_170410_1605_0035.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9atqg"&gt;The number of government-led internet shutdowns has exploded over the last decade as states seek to stifle dissent and protest by limiting citizens’ access to the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVRjKN"&gt;Nearly 850 intentional shutdowns have been recorded over the past 10 years by nonprofit Access Now’s &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/"&gt;Shutdown Tracker Optimization Project&lt;/a&gt; (STOP), and although the group acknowledges that data on incidents before 2016 is “patchy,” some 768 of these shutdowns took place in the last five years. There were 213 shutdowns in 2019 alone, with this figure ticking down to 155 in 2020 as the world adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic (which delayed elections and led to lockdowns that kept populations at home more often). And already in the first five months of 2021 there have been 50 shutdowns across 21 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BbxImH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It has moved from the fringes to become a common method”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OVstsN"&gt;“Since we began tracking government-initiated internet shutdowns, their use has proliferated at a truly alarming pace,” Access Now’s Felicia Anthonio, campaigner and &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/"&gt;#KeepItOn&lt;/a&gt; lead, said in a report on the issue in &lt;a href="https://jigsaw.google.com/the-current/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Current&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a publication of Google’s internet thinktank Jigsaw. “As governments across the globe learn this authoritarian tactic from each other, it has moved from the fringes to become a common method many authorities use to stifle opposition, quash free speech and muzzle expression.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYybKa"&gt;The first significant internet shutdown took place in Egypt in 2011, as a response to protests against then-president Hosni Mubarak. As a result, an &lt;a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/internetintelligence/egypt-leaves-the-internet-v3"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; 93 percent of Egyptian networks were blocked for five days. Earlier internet shutdowns and slowdowns were carried out in Guinea in 2007 and in Iran in 2009, but Egypt’s was the first to affect internet connections across an entire country where more than a quarter of citizens had access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C99kyL"&gt;Since then, shutdowns have spread across the world, most prominently in Asia and Africa. They’re most frequently deployed during elections or times of protest, with governments claiming shutdowns are needed to stem the spread of misinformation. In reality, though, as the report in &lt;em&gt;The Current&lt;/em&gt; notes, the intention is to “prevent opposition candidates from connecting with voters to build support, restrict the ability of citizens to organize, and undermine the efforts of election observers to ensure the integrity of the vote.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="99sWsr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many governments see the internet “as a threat that needs to be ‘controlled’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHDkyj"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Marianne Díaz Hernández, a Venezuelan lawyer and #KeepItOn Fellow, says the rise in shutdowns is a response to the internet’s increasing utility for organizing protest. “As more and more people use the internet, and particularly social media, to document and denounce human rights violations, civil unrest and other events, some governments start seeing the internet as a threat that needs to be ‘controlled,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPiT7u"&gt;In addition to the stifling of free speech and assembly, internet shutdowns have significant economic harms. In Myanmar, which has seen the longest-ever government-led internet shutdown in history as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-55902070"&gt;recent coup&lt;/a&gt;, it’s estimated the &lt;a href="https://www.top10vpn.com/cost-of-internet-shutdowns/"&gt;economic loss&lt;/a&gt; has been equal to 2.5 percent of the country’s GDP — around $2.1 billion. The report in &lt;em&gt;The Current&lt;/em&gt; notes that this “inflicted on the country approximately half the damage wrought by the Great Recession on the US economy in less than a third of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJbwQ0"&gt;Combatting the issue seems difficult at a high level. Internet shutdowns have been condemned by various international organizations, including the G7 and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Special Rapporteurs, but as Access Now’s data shows, this doesn’t seem to have dinted their use. There have also been some legislative wins, as when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Community Court, ruled that &lt;a href="https://www.accessnow.org/ecowas-togo-court-decision/"&gt;a 2017 internet shutdown in Togo was illegal&lt;/a&gt;, but it also seems unlikely such actions will actually dissuade governments who feel shutdowns are necessary to hold power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOzS8e"&gt;The best method to combat internet shutdowns seem technological. VPNs and proxy servers allow users to rout internet traffic through another country to avoid certain blocks, while mesh networking apps can connect directly from one device to another, providing basic messaging functionality though no access to the wider internet. But access to such tools is not guaranteed: it depends on people knowing they can be used in the first place and downloading them in advance of a shutdown. At least the internet can be used to help get the word out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue partners with Spotify to turn all your lights into a music visualizer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person on a bed listening to music with way too many pink and purple lights in their room" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNKoEMl2fxwfURSgeoBlxHPQjhY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801785/Philips_Hue___Spotify___Image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9if6Zf"&gt;If you’ve got a home full of Hue lights, there’s an easy new way to set the mood for your next party. Signify, which makes the Philips Hue line, is partnering with Spotify so that your lightbulbs can automatically sync up with whatever music you have playing, changing color and flashing along to the beat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZ5GLO"&gt;There are already plenty of ways to sync your lights to music — including Signify’s own Hue Sync app — but those methods typically require letting an app or some external hardware listen in on everything you’re playing. This new partnership avoids that by letting the Hue Bridge tap directly into Spotify to see what’s playing once you’ve linked your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6FJkTm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Hue Bridge and color bulbs are required&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zetiK"&gt;That close partnership is also supposed to provide a better experience, letting the Hue system adjust lighting effects based on specific data about the music you’re playing, including its genre, tempo, volume, mood, and more. You can also go into the app and customize the effects if you don’t want the system deciding how to light things on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTczIH"&gt;The system comes with a couple of catches: to use it, you’ll need a Hue Bridge, which not every Hue owner is going to have (newer bulbs can be used over Bluetooth without the dedicated hub); and the feature only supports color bulbs. On the other hand, you &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;need a paid Spotify subscription — free accounts will work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enZnM5"&gt;Signify says the feature will start rolling out today and be available to all Hue users within a week. It’s initially being billed as an “early access” feature; in October, it’s supposed to get more prominent billing as a “permanent part” of the Hue app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhyCUs"&gt;In addition to the Spotify partnership, Signify announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22414992"&gt;a whole bunch of new Hue lights today&lt;/a&gt;, including more filament lights, brighter bulb configurations, and updated lamps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue adds a whole bunch of new lights, including a ‘light tube’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1uTVX7"&gt;The Philips Hue line of smart bulbs is growing today with the addition of a bunch of new lights, strips, and lamps. There’s a bunch of stuff, so here’s a quick rundown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FyQ0wZ"&gt;New filament bulbs that can change color temperature (plus a new candle shape for filament bulbs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZpSiM3"&gt;Brighter options (75 watt and 100 watt equivalent) for color-temperature changing and full color versions of the standard Hue bulbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9fGmmE"&gt;A “light tube” for illuminating around your TV (it’s meant to sync the colors to what’s on screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qkQUJv"&gt;Enhanced versions of the Signe floor and table lamps that can display multiple colors at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oqj5Z5"&gt;An upgraded TV-focused lightstrip, the “Hue ambiance gradient lightstrip,” which can likewise display multiple colors at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k8EMDd"&gt;A new ceiling light called Infuse that can change colors and throws a bit of light up onto the ceiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQss7i9bFbXvL7jemqPKnhFw5i4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818294/Philips_Hue_Filament_White_Ambiance.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Hue filament lights&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9YhKYS"&gt;The products are rolling out over the coming months, with some configurations of the brighter bulbs and filament bulbs available right away, the lightstrip and lamps coming in October, and the light tube coming and ceiling coming in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIlyGf"&gt;Signify, which makes the Hue lineup, is also releasing a Hue app update today that’ll allow for “dynamic scenes,” which let lights continually shift colors. Later this fall, the company plans to launch a “natural light” scene that’ll let your lights adjust their color temperature throughout the day to mimic the light of the sun, with cooler tones in the morning and warmer tones at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpptRtt-PuCvoJGtusQJTz6JC28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818302/Philips_Hue_ambiance_gradient_light_strip_and_gradient_Signe.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Signe floor lamp (left) and gradient light strip (center... but not actually visible). Both lights can show multiple colors at once.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cV0VkF"&gt;The Hue Play HDMI sync box, which syncs lights with your TV screen, is also getting an update later this fall to support 120Hz gaming. Unfortunately, it’ll only support up to 1440p resolution at that high refresh rate, so you’ll have to choose what to prioritize. The box already supports 4K gaming but at only 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4on0Y"&gt;In addition to the new bulbs, Signify also announced a partnership with Spotify to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22414937"&gt;sync your lights to whatever music you have playing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ivermectin misinformation has poisoned Amazon’s platform, with few fixes planned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SATPKw-tD54xKwlhqcz9AeKMKx0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801615/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P8SF6L"&gt;Earlier this week, I started a search on Amazon and mistyped, entering just two letters in: “iv.” Amazon then helpfully compiled a list of suggested search results, almost all of which were for the horse de-worming version of the drug ivermectin. That drug is at the center of one of the more recent and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1431040456364810242"&gt;more mind-boggling&lt;/a&gt; parts of the anti-vaccine misinformation story, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;false cure touted by hucksters and others out to make a quick buck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni2rc3"&gt;This evening, Amazon spokesperson Craig Andrews tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Amazon’s autocomplete responses are driven by customer activity. We are blocking certain autocomplete responses to address these concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfKxJd"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;Facebook, TikTok, and Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has not gotten a lid on limiting the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Unlike those platforms and others, Amazon has seemingly done very little to try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Autocomplete results on Amazon for “iv” showing ivermectin." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m_XiNgN1O8l-CcsOQ6s_3teK2O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819245/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_8.28.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Autocomplete results on Amazon for “iv” showing ivermectin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="clcsdW"&gt;Amazon is not unique in using an algorithm to drive its autocomplete results. But as companies like Google have learned, there are “data voids” for previously unpopular search terms that can suddenly skew the algorithm when those terms get swept up in a new misinformation campaign. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550430/google-search-results-changing-quickly-warning-breaking-news"&gt;Google has gone to some length&lt;/a&gt; to try to solve the data void problem, most recently by presenting warnings on search results it thinks might suffer from the issue. As of the publication of this article, Amazon’s search results still show entries for ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSy53W"&gt;When you click through to one of those suggested search terms, Amazon simply lists many options for purchasing the drug meant to treat animals — without any further context about its dangers when ingested by humans. Although there are legitimate uses for ivermectin in humans, treating COVID-19 isn’t one of them. And though it should go without saying that taking the veterinary version is a very bad idea, that’s exactly what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hyu0u4"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/15400.pdf"&gt;bulletin issued by the Mississippi department of health&lt;/a&gt;, the agency says that “At least 70% of the recent calls [to poison control] have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrvAaf"&gt;Ivermectin can cause side effects ranging from “skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, facial or limb swelling, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalization and liver injury (hepatitis),” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/faq-covid-19-and-ivermectin-intended-animals"&gt;according to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g2CS74"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4"&gt;https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1429050070243192839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FadffS"&gt;Where other platforms have put effort into presenting information boxes leading to reliable and trustworthy information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 treatments, Amazon shows no such information in either its search results nor on product pages for ivermectin. An Amazon spokesperson tells me that if you search specifically for “ivermectin for covid,” it does display only a link to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;FDA’s warning page about the drug&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL6Xo1"&gt;It does appear that on at least some product listings, at least some moderation teams at Amazon are keeping an eye out for problems. Some of the top search results for ivermectin have very few written reviews. Scroll down a bit, however, and there are plenty that are clearly meant to discuss the use of the drug in humans. One reviewer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Duramectin-Ivermectin-Paste-1-87-Horses/dp/B07PT9NGGQ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ivermectin&amp;amp;qid=1630467118&amp;amp;sr=8-9&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that it “Worked good on my 200lb horse” and that “long CV already going away.” Another &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bimectin-Paste-For-Equine/dp/B003UO0QOS/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ivermectin&amp;amp;qid=1630468754&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rated&lt;/a&gt; a product 5 stars, writing that “I love the taste [...] Ivermectin too hard to get, but so effective at preventing something I cannot mention here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SPmdv"&gt;Over on Reddit, more than a hundred subreddits &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/reddits-teach-the-controversy-stance-on-covid-vaccines-sparks-wider-protest/"&gt;went dark today&lt;/a&gt; in protest of that platform’s refusal to ban communities that spread COVID-19 misinformation. TikTok appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;playing whack-a-mole&lt;/a&gt; with videos on its platform, and Facebook has struggled to enforce its policies against misinformation as communities &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;resort to euphemisms&lt;/a&gt; like “moo juice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwN9pb"&gt;On Amazon, veterinary ivermectin remains easy to find without being shown any science-based information that could inform a consumer of the dangers of taking a drug that is meant for animals. It also remains easy to purchase on that platform, in some cases with free Amazon Prime delivery, fulfilled by an Amazon warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BqwBVJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey Amazon this autocomplete result for just two letters is VERY BAD on so many levels. Not only does it reveal how easily your algorithm can be skewed by misinformation, it’s also possibly leading to genuine, human harm. &lt;a href="https://t.co/A2hfsKIcQr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A2hfsKIcQr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1432548841518092292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new ‘adaptive volume’ will make Alexa speak louder when it’s noisy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XptYQQwOXx-MUYwLFCK59T_P9Lc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801027/dseifert_201025_4263_00012.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gvnSWG"&gt;Amazon is working to solve a frustration with smart home speakers by introducing a feature called Adaptive Volume, which will make Alexa respond louder if it detects that you’re in a noisy environment. According to the company, the mode is meant to make sure that you can still hear Alexa’s responses over any background noise (like the sound of a dishwasher, people talking, or music playing on another device). Amazon says that the feature is currently available to US customers, and that you can activate it by saying “Alexa, turn on adaptive volume.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGRyr9"&gt;Amazon doesn’t mention adaptive volume working in the opposite direction, becoming quieter if there’s no background noise, but there are other ways to reduce the volume dynamically. One of them is Whisper Mode, where Alexa will whisper its response if you talk to it quietly. As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFK0rKnPZPw"&gt;this relaxing video&lt;/a&gt; points out, you can activate the mode by asking Alexa to “turn on whisper mode.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6WLJux"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFK0rKnPZPw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tOusVh"&gt;If you’re instead looking to just adjust the volume depending on what time it is, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/gqq9kz/is_it_possible_to_have_alexa_adjust_her_response/frujab2?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Alexa enthusiasts recommend doing so&lt;/a&gt; by adding a “set volume” action to a custom routine that activates at a certain time, or making it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/alexa-can-you-chill-quick-and-easy-workarounds-for-5-minor-issues/"&gt;part of your bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIBiox"&gt;We just gave Adaptive Volume a quick test with an Echo Dot sitting next to a desktop PC with a spinning fan, and it seems a little bit inconsistent; some of Alexa’s responses were louder than usual, but others went back to the original volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cie8Bv"&gt;It’s worth noting that the Adaptive Volume feature isn’t the same as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;spherical Echo fourth gen’s&lt;/a&gt; adaptive sound, which uses the device’s microphones to tune music to sound better in your specific room. This also isn’t the first time we’ve seen a smart assistant try to adapt its volume to the user’s environment — &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/thread/29125230/ambient-iq-how-google-nest-speakers-work?hl=en"&gt;Google Nest’s Ambient IQ&lt;/a&gt; promises to do something similar for spoken word content or assistant responses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pledges another small but welcome sum to racial justice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9Y_J8KAdDaqwZr6u6njzXwXsLI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801019/VRG_4132_BigTechs_Commitment_Lede_FR.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2rpl3"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-broadens-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-with-30-million-in-new-commitments%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has pledged&lt;/a&gt; another $30 million to racial justice, on top of the $100 million it promised last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV1EwC"&gt;It includes funding for a wide array of causes, including a Global Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub at California State University Northridge in Los Angeles, with the intent to create regional hubs at other universities, and an expansion of its work to bring community coding centers to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by adding 11 additional schools to the roster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MXnnS"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;we calculated just how small the donations from Big Tech were compared to their immense profits&lt;/a&gt;, and today’s $30 million doesn’t really change the calculus there. At the rate Apple is currently raking in cash, it takes just 2.31 hours, or roughly 139 minutes, to make $30 million in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTzh38"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$30 million for Apple is like $7.51 to the median US family&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drXnY3"&gt;Or — to bring the comparison down to earth a bit — it’s like if &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html"&gt;a middle-class US family&lt;/a&gt; made a one-time donation of seven dollars and fifty-one cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmKs0I"&gt;It’s also not entirely clear how much of Apple’s now-$130 million contribution is in the form of donations, rather than investments where Apple might get its money back: in January, the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revealed at least $35 million would be invested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UezQqT"&gt;Still, it’s notable that Apple’s still sending significant sums towards racial justice at all, when an expert we quoted last year suggested that companies might turn their attention elsewhere when the moment fades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkWXhT"&gt;Cash also isn’t everything. There’s also institutional change to consider. Also: “It’s not just about where you’re going, but it’s also about owning up to where you have been, and how you may have contributed to a situation that exists right now, and that the wealth and prosperity of your business could be rooted in, is likely rooted in, some deep-seated inequities,” Laura Morgan Roberts, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told us last year. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tELnPI"&gt;Google may be working on a new wireless charging stand for its Pixel phones, according to a leaked image of a retail inventory backend mentioning a “Google Pixel 23W WL Stand” &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/31/exclusive-googles-new-pixel-stand-for-the-pixel-6-should-support-23w-fast-wireless-charging/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The name suggests the charger could support 23W wireless charging, and if Google does end up releasing this stand, it seems likely that the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro would support 23W charging as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CiWQpx"&gt;That wireless charging speed, if accurate, would be more than the iPhone 12’s maximum 15W wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514850/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging-speed"&gt;with a MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt; and surpass the 10W wireless charging offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;by the original Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which is still available on &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_stand?hl=en-US"&gt;Google’s online store&lt;/a&gt;). Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEe95k"&gt;The company revealed the first details about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;earlier in August&lt;/a&gt;. They seem like promising devices, especially with their new Google-designed Tensor system on a chip, and 23W wireless charging could make them an even more enticing purchase. Google plans to release those phones this fall, and if this new charging stand is real, it seems likely it will come out alongside them — especially since the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;won’t ship with an included charging brick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
