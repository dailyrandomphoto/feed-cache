    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The president’s plan to take EVs mainstream will first need to contend with a fractured charging network&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="R955AR"&gt;Aaron Fisher first came face to face with the US’s inconvenient and broken electric vehicle charging infrastructure two years ago. Driving a borrowed BMW i3 from New York City to Hartford, Connecticut, for his grandmother’s 90th birthday party, he assumed the journey would be a short, three-hour jaunt. Instead, it lasted a grueling seven hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anHupP"&gt;“I had charger issues, I had payment issues, I had customer service issues, I had routing issues, because of the fragmentation around electric vehicle charging,” Fisher said. As for his grandmother’s birthday? “I missed her dinner,” he said ruefully. “She was not mad, but very disappointed.”     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rI6Xiu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I had charger issues, I had payment issues, I had customer service issues, I had routing issues”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6mwYt"&gt;There are approximately 41,000 public charging stations in the United States, with more than 100,000 outlets. But finding one that actually works or isn’t locked inside a gated parking garage can be a bit of a scavenger hunt. The charging experience in the US is almost comically fragmented, especially for non-Tesla owners. While Tesla’s Supercharger network has been praised for its seamless user experience and fast charging ability, the opposite appears to be true for pretty much everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9E9b8"&gt;Fisher, a former management consultant who also briefly interned in the Obama White House, was so frustrated by his experience trying to drive an EV in the US that he founded his own company, &lt;a href="https://evpassport.com/"&gt;EVPassport&lt;/a&gt;, based on the principle that charging your electric vehicle should not require signing up for a dozen different smartphone apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="truYug"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FXClEw"&gt;“You shouldn’t have to hand over your birthday, you shouldn’t have to hand over your email address, you shouldn’t have to hand over your full name, or anything in an application or agree to any type of privacy policy necessarily, in order to charge your vehicle,” Fisher said. “You don’t have to do that when you get gas. Why do you have to do that when you’re trying to do something better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdufBn"&gt;Fortunately, the whole system appears headed toward a massive overhaul. President Joe Biden, an avowed muscle car guy who is currently trying to claim the mantle of “most environmentally friendly president in history,” recently introduced a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;$174 billion of which is earmarked for electric cars&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that plan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden wants to build 500,000 new EV chargers by 2030&lt;/a&gt; — 11 times the current number of stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IlundW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s kind of like banking in the ’90s.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B2kjwF"&gt;Biden will have his work cut out for him. Despite rapid growth in sales over the past few years, EVs are still a niche product, making up just 2 percent of the new car market and 1 percent of all cars, SUVs, vans, and pickup trucks on the road. That said, sales are expected to pick up in the next few years, depending on new incentives and point-of-sale rebates that are currently being debated. But when they do, there are real questions about whether the nation’s disjointed, low-tech, outdated charging system will be up to the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAO1Oj"&gt;“There’s no APIs in the charging marketplace,” Fisher said, referring to the software intermediary that allows two apps to communicate. “It’s kind of like banking in the ’90s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An EV charging station in Clifton, New Jersey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4mYHUq"&gt;The Charging Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qf779J"&gt;On paper, the EV charging network sounds like it’s doing pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh8Ycm"&gt;A closer look reveals how incredibly uneven it is. One-third of those stations are located in one state: California, with a whopping 22,620 stations, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/01/02/got-an-electric-car-great-where-do-you-plug-it-in"&gt;recent study by Pew Trust&lt;/a&gt;. Other states have few, bordering on none. North Dakota has 36 public chargers, Alaska just 26.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cm4M6k"&gt;But don’t mistake California as some sort of bastion of enlightened EV ownership. A recent study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00814-9.epdf?sharing_token=uF_2e31XTz7IdZatbzc2n9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OdQo1MtvaTf2fRd9Yuvl4XeI57cinWGD0KaEwg1kf5THhCyeCk3r2oBBFOSmxwPbmP0qC6zHJ87gfQNLGiweb_Ea1e6LlFPBHPCoZ_WO4gyXhTae0rZ7jUJ1X6COdfcI1XGB1s_GpyHsXFrZ8kfVdgiDUVELizUFlWo69AA2XYSm27uS_KovYj15euvibQ6-0%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=arstechnica.com"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by a research team from the University of California, Davis found that about 1 in 5 EV owners — 20 percent of plug-in hybrid vehicle owners and 18 percent of pure battery-electric vehicle owners — eventually switched back to gas-powered vehicles. The top reason cited was “dissatisfaction with the convenience of charging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fhNjg"&gt;This shouldn’t come as a surprise. “Range anxiety,” or the fear of running out of power before finding the next charging station, has long been cited as a major barrier to mass EV adoption. But while range has steadily improved over the years, with many EVs now able to travel 300 miles or more on a single charge, the anxiety has shifted to the inadequacies of the charging network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ApsvLV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The anxiety has shifted to the inadequacies of the charging network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yJuzcs"&gt;Chargers can be hard to find, and the act of charging takes much longer than refueling a gas car. The research team at UC Davis noted this in their study. “The way in which a [plug-in electric vehicle] is charged has not changed, whereas vehicle range has been increasing since [plug-in hybrid electric vehicles] and [battery-electric vehicles] were introduced,” they conclude. Electric vehicle owners “have the option to purchase longer-range vehicles, whereas they cannot yet purchase a vehicle that is charged differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAD63W"&gt;EV boosters say that much of the problem stems from a faulty frame of reference. We see how many gas stations are available — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gasbuddy.com%2Fgo%2Fgas-price-report-january-18-2020%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DUnlike%2520fuel%2520retailer%2520apps%252C%2520as%2Capp%2520focused%2520on%2520gas%2520savings.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22419150%2Fev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;around 150,000 by some estimates&lt;/a&gt; — and believe that the same should be true for chargers if EVs are ever to replace their gas-powered counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGSYdT"&gt;This ignores the fact that most EV owners do their charging overnight while parked in their driveway at home. But if EVs are to become a more attractive option to car buyers, charging stations are going to need to become more pervasive like gas stations. People need to see the expansion with their own eyes in order to overcome the psychological hurdle that prevents them from imagining an electric future. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dkOQOm"&gt;There are educational obstacles, too. The way car companies communicate the amount of time it takes to charge an EV completely misses the point, said Chris Nelder, manager of Carbon-Free Mobility at the Rocky Mountain Institute. Automakers avoid talking about kilowatts and kilowatt-hours, instead relying on the nonsense metric of miles-per-minute of charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtpBi1"&gt;“We all understand this when it comes to gasoline,” Nelder said. “We all know what a gallon is. We all know how many gallons of gas our tanks can hold. We all know how many miles per gallon our vehicles get. But for some reason everybody operating in this space is afraid to explain to a customer what the equivalent is on the electric side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqXxCD"&gt;This is one of the educational hurdles that the Biden administration will confront in its quest to get more people in EVs. But it’s not clear the administration is focused on education, so much as incentivizing the purchase of more EVs through tax credits, point-of-sale rebates, and direct subsidies to automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4izoi"&gt;Money, the policymakers have determined, will be the thing to spur this shift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IsY2xU"&gt;The Money Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TABdH5"&gt;The White House has said it will spend at least $15 billion to begin rolling out the new charging stations. But experts say far more will be needed to shore up charging infrastructure to meet the growing demands of EV ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkOMEm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.governing.com/next/biden-wants-500-000-charging-stations-how-will-we-get-there"&gt;Wedbush Securities has estimated&lt;/a&gt; that at least $60 billion will be needed to build 500,000 chargers by the end of 2030, as Biden has stated. Another analysis by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/us-ev-charging-system-a-priority-under-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan.html"&gt;industry consultant AlixPartners&lt;/a&gt; said $50 billion would be needed to grow the US charging network to meet the demand within the next decade. That means Biden will need at least $35 billion more, either from private investments or state and local government matching funds, if he is to meet his goal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ub1d5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden will need at least $35 billion more if he is to meet his goal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enmMdm"&gt;Installing EV chargers can be expensive, depending on the level of charging that’s being offered. The higher the level, the quicker the charge and the more expensive it is to install. A public Level 2 charger might cost $2,000 out of the box, but a DC fast charger of 150kW or more can cost between $100,000 and $250,000, Nelder said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VplS8C"&gt;The federal government could intervene in making those costs cheaper, but it won’t be easy. That would require sitting down with utility companies and regulatory commissions in all 50 states, as well as the private EV charging companies, to bring down the capital investments for charging stations through &lt;a href="https://www.cenhud.com/my-energy/electric-vehicles/EV-make-ready-program/"&gt;“make ready” programs&lt;/a&gt;. These are programs in which public utilities and local governments identify sites that are intended for EV charging and allow companies to submit bids for installation. There is no federal “make ready” program, though, and only a few states employ this method of fast-tracking EV charger installation. The Biden administration could make things a lot easier by creating a national system for states to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QpvZw91acBO0TZ0iZ0f8SE8e16M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498539/ahawkins_20210503_4551_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An EV charging station in Clifton, New Jersey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rdZDJt"&gt;Another looming problem is utilization and how utilities charge for the electricity they provide. Most EV charging stations sit unoccupied because EVs still only make up a tiny fraction of the overall car market. That means the business case for building more chargers is very difficult to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMjFif"&gt;“It’s that first few years where you want me to put a quarter million into a station, and then I can’t get better than 5 percent utilization,” said Henry Lee, director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s environmental and natural resource program. “I lose my shirt in the first three or four years, but by year seven or eight, I could be making money on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nBfOCm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I lose my shirt in the first three or four years, but by year seven or eight, I could be making money on it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P8aBki"&gt;Lee noted that the cost of electricity is another problem for EV charging companies. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/getting-the-rates-right-for-a-public-electric-vehicle-charging-buildout"&gt;Demand charges&lt;/a&gt; from utility companies tend to dominate charging companies’ operating costs, further complicating the business case for building more charging stations. The total cost of electricity is higher based on the level of charging they provide. These calculations need to be rethought if the government wants to incentivize the EV charging industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix16Q5"&gt;“How you restructure this formula for these kinds of stations is something that we haven’t quite figured out,” Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c2Qo4A"&gt;The Tesla Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuMtv"&gt;Tesla’s Supercharger network is often held up as the best possible example of an EV charging network: fast, reliable, and plentiful. But Tesla’s network is also exclusive to Tesla owners, meaning someone driving a Volkswagen EV wouldn’t be able to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5iiBE"&gt;Other EV companies have expressed interest in a proprietary system. Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35892061/rivian-adventure-ev-charging-network/"&gt;said recently it would build its own network&lt;/a&gt; of 3,500 fast chargers at 600 locations around the country by 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHU2TE"&gt;These kinds of close systems are worrisome if more car companies decide they want their own networks. But Nelder said that two automakers building their own exclusive charging networks isn’t necessarily an indication of where things are headed for EV charging. First of all, Nelder said that Rivian’s goal of 3,500 fast chargers in two years was almost impossible, given the intense and expensive amount of work that each site requires.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVMCB7"&gt;“I literally laughed out loud,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="YRHgYn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qARK6f"&gt;But even then, Nelder said he hopes that the Biden administration is strict about what kind of charging projects are eligible for public money. “To whatever extent public money is being spent, it should only be spent on sites that are available to the public,” he said, “and that’s certainly true for this Biden infrastructure spending plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPG1HF"&gt;Ideally, more electric vehicles will include the Plug and Charge standard that was initially introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/55365.html"&gt;ISO 15118&lt;/a&gt;. This standard enables an EV to automatically identify and authorize itself to a charging station on behalf of the driver. For example, when it goes on sale in the US later this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes-Benz EQS&lt;/a&gt; will be compatible with about 90 percent of the public charging stations in the US without the need to download an app or sign up for an individual charging service, thanks to the Plug and Charge system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa0aWx"&gt;But there are many EVs coming onto the market without Plug and Charge, such as the Volkswagen ID 4 and Chevy Bolt EUV, and it’s unclear why. This is another source of frustration and confusion for Aaron Fisher of EVPassport. It’s a sign that for all the good news on the horizon, the EV charging infrastructure in the US will remain opaque and challenging for months, if not years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pJ2fXW"&gt;“It feels like they’re missing some very core decisions at a high level,” Fisher said of the auto industry. “I don’t know if it’s a lack of planning, or just they’re trying to focus on cars and getting them out the door.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the real Alexa: voice actor reportedly responsible for Amazon’s AI assistant revealed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pZK5vmTYJ0uQeQ3l53BhdT3Hhs=/1x0:1083x721/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69268067/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_1.38.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journalist Brad Stone says Nina Rolle is the original voice of Alexa. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ninarolle.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Nina Rolle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxS7hQ"&gt;Amazon’s Alexa has a voice familiar to millions: calm, warm, and measured. But like most synthetic speech, its tones have a human origin. There was someone whose voice had to be recorded, analyzed, and algorithmically reproduced to create Alexa as we know it now. Amazon has never revealed who this “original Alexa” is, but journalist Brad Stone says he tracked her down, and she is Nina Rolle, a voiceover artist based in Boulder, Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gifn7T"&gt;The claim comes from Stone’s upcoming book on the tech giant, &lt;em&gt;Amazon Unbound&lt;/em&gt;, an excerpt of which is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-amazon-made-alexa-smarter/"&gt;published here&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Wired. &lt;/em&gt;Neither Amazon nor Rolle confirmed or denied Stone’s guess, which he says is based on conversations with the professional voiceover community, but Rolle’s &lt;a href="https://www.ninarolle.com/"&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt; alone makes for a compelling case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to1azF"&gt;Listen to the videos below: the first an advertisement for Cherry Creek North, “Denver’s premier outdoor retail destination,” and the second an introduction to Hapyn, a social app that seems to now be defunct (its Play Store &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F544363296&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22430185%2Falexa-voice-actor-amazon-nina-rolle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; was last updated in 2017). You can absolutely hear Alexa’s reassuring tones in Rolle’s voice. Or, to be more precise, you can absolutely hear where Alexa’s reassuring tones come from when listening to Rolle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1jRqLV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zztoCRmT_ds?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="3oFNjI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psyfHVAhA_s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aygA22"&gt;Here’s how Stone writes up the process in selecting Alexa’s voice: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ojiuX2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believing that the selection of the right voice for Alexa was critical, [then-Amazon exec Greg] Hart and colleagues spent months reviewing the recordings of various candidates that GM Voices produced for the project, and presented the top picks to Bezos. The Amazon team ranked the best ones, asked for additional samples, and finally made a choice. Bezos signed off on it. Characteristically secretive, Amazon has never revealed the name of the voice artist behind Alexa. I learned her identity after canvasing the professional voice-over community: Boulder, Colorado–based voice actress and singer Nina Rolle. Her professional website contains links to old radio ads for products such as Mott’s Apple Juice and the Volkswagen Passat—and the warm timbre of Alexa’s voice is unmistakable. Rolle said she wasn’t allowed to talk to me when I reached her on the phone in February 2021. When I asked Amazon to speak with her, they declined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qCjuxs"&gt;We’ve pinged Amazon and Rolle to confirm her involvement in creating Alexa, but don’t expect to hear much back. If the company isn’t interested in confirming Stone’s account, it suggests this is a bit of history they’d rather not draw attention to, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcQ4UB"&gt;Providing the voice for such a ubiquitous product can have its own drawbacks, too. The original voice artist behind Siri, Susan Bennett, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/4/4801812/the-voice-of-siri-is-susan-bennett"&gt;revealed herself in 2013&lt;/a&gt; (after seeing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/17/4596374/machine-language-how-siri-found-its-voice"&gt;an article from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dissecting the process behind the creation of synthesized voices, incidentally) but said she’d been wary about being associated with Siri. “I was conservative about it for a long time [...] then this &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; video came out [...] and it seems like everyone was clamoring to find out who the real voice behind Siri is, and so I thought, well, you know, what the heck? This is the time,” Bennett told &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/04/tech/mobile/bennett-siri-iphone-voice/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWHr5G"&gt;Of course, although we can hear both Bennett and Rolle’s voices in their AI doppelgängers, it’s impossible to say without inside knowledge exactly what traces of the original remain. Creating a synthetic voice &lt;em&gt;starts&lt;/em&gt; with real audio samples, but this data is exhaustively quantized and remastered to such a degree that answering the question of whether the final product is the same as the original is best reserved for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus"&gt;shipbuilders of Theseus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOEnbW"&gt;What is, fun, though, is listening to the other examples of Rolle’s voiceover work on her &lt;a href="https://www.ninarolle.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Although she offers a restrained performance in the videos above, she’s much more animated and lively in other commercial samples. It really shows how, despite the ever-increasing sophistication of Alexa’s voice, it still lacks the range of the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s Magic Keyboard alternative is $30 off at multiple retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Logitech’s keyboard alternative is nearly half the price of Apple’s Magic Keyboard. | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NskKBN"&gt;Unless you’re willing to shell out for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Magic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, Logitech’s Folio Touch might be your best bet for turning your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;second-gen, 11-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; into a laptop. Right now, both &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Trackpad-Connector-11-inch/dp/B08HRQV5V8?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740253167256169203#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are taking $30 off the well-regarded keyboard case, rendering it one of the best sales we’ve seen on the device in recent months. In addition to the dedicated trackpad and a fabric-like finish, Logitech’s offering features like backlit keys, iPadOS integration, and more protection than you’ll get from any of Apple’s proprietary offerings. It’s heavy, sure, but the added heft is a small price to pay when compared to the cost of a replacement screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PTxSKi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10493403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Like the last time it went on sale, today’s deal will likely only be available for a limited time, meaning now is your chance to nab the enhanced Wii U port and its feline-focused expansion before the price jumps up again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Oversight Board has upheld Trump’s ban — what’s next?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_-coNBLmzkV17D5QukQQ2RzqNRc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267981/VRG_ILLO_4577_Decoder_Kate_Klonick_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook moderation expert Kate Klonick weighs in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QyED8s"&gt;Today we’re focused on one of the most complicated problems of all: content moderation. If you’ve kept up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know that content moderation seems to come up almost every week — the question of how platform companies decide what to leave up and what to take down is messy, controversial, and extremely political.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSDHQ6"&gt;And if something on the internet is messy, controversial, and political, you know that Facebook will be at the bleeding edge of it. Last year, the company announced that it would send difficult moderation problems to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;a new entity it calls the Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt; — a committee made up of lawyers, politicians, and speech experts that would rule on whether specific content takedowns on Facebook were appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgWfiS"&gt;That board just got its first big test last week, as it issued a decision about whether former President Trump’s indefinite ban from Facebook platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;would stay in place&lt;/a&gt;. And the decision was to kick the issue back to Facebook — the board said Facebook didn’t have an actual policy in place for it to review, and that Facebook should make one and send it back to the board in six months. In the meantime, Trump remains banned from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0dlRK"&gt;So what does all that mean? What is the Facebook Oversight Board, what are its powers, and how is it even independent from Facebook itself? You’ve probably heard people call it the Supreme Court of Facebook — is that the right way to think about it? Will every platform require a moderation court like this in the future, or is this just another way for Facebook to exert influence over the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEyCxG"&gt;This is a big new experiment, and the Trump decision is a big moment for that experiment. To help figure it all out, I asked &lt;a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/law/faculty/kate-klonick"&gt;Kate Klonick, a law professor at St. John’s University&lt;/a&gt; Law School, to join the show. Kate has been researching and studying the Oversight Board from the start — she embedded with the board as it was forming to write a definitive piece for &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; called “&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/inside-the-making-of-facebooks-supreme-court"&gt;Inside the Making of Facebook’s Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H25gco"&gt;Kate and I talked about what the board is — and isn’t — what its powers are, and what this decision means for the board’s authority in the future. And we talked a lot about what it means for private companies to have things that look and feel like legal systems — if you step back, it is bonkers to think that any company needs to fund anything that looks like a Supreme Court. But Facebook is that big and that globally powerful. So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5ktcq"&gt;One note, I mention a Supreme Court case called &lt;em&gt;Marbury v. Madison&lt;/em&gt; — that’s the very famous case from early in the county’s history where the Supreme Court basically gave itself the power to invalidate laws passed by Congress. Oh, and you might pick up that I’m nervous here and there — that’s because I always, always get nervous talking to law professors. I feel like I’m back in my 1L days every time. Bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr0qcc"&gt;Okay, Kate Klonick, from St. John’s University Law School. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j5mdf3"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4935653179" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xcISSe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krUNTO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate Klonick, you’re a law professor at St. John’s University Law School. You are also one of the foremost chroniclers of Facebook’s moderation efforts. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IR3ZKC"&gt;Thank you so much for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YcrBO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re talking the day after the Facebook Oversight Board released a big decision about whether Facebook was correct to indefinitely ban Donald Trump from its platform. There’s a lot of concepts in that sentence alone. Let’s start with the Facebook Oversight Board itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBOWIC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In February, you published a long piece in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; called “Inside the Making of Facebook’s Supreme Court,” which detailed the process by which Facebook conceived of having an oversight board, literally the meetings and the software they use to create this board virtually during a pandemic. This decision feels like the first big moment for that board. What is the Facebook Oversight Board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vC3DlR"&gt;We still don’t know exactly. I know that’s the worst answer ever to start out, but I think it’s the right one. So we can talk about how it’s been talked about, and I think that that’s going to lead us to what we saw yesterday and what we can make of this opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQH5kF"&gt;So in November of 2018, Mark Zuckerberg announced that he was going to set up this, what had been colloquially joked about and called the “Supreme Court” of Facebook. This idea that they were going to start running certain types of content moderation decisions. Once they had finished being appealed internally at Facebook, they would make it possible to appeal to an outside, independent oversight board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="991dHS"&gt;And the question was, how the hell do you set that up? You have a pretty fundamental principal-agent problem right off the bat. And then how do you set that up? What does it make you do? And how do you make this work when you’re talking about public rights of freedom of expression and international human rights law? This is where the conversation was and still is, to some degree. And you’re talking about a private corporation. How do you make something have teeth? How do you make it legitimate? How do you make it independent? All of these questions were very open and on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BS24El"&gt;And so about six months after that announcement from Zuckerberg I started following, inside Facebook, the government and strategic initiatives team, which was the team that had basically been tasked, under Nick Clegg, to come up with this solution to what exactly this board was going to be and how they were going to solve all of these institution-building problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqFniH"&gt;And so I started following that and I ended up doing that for 18 months, watching as they wrote their documents and figured out what they were going to do. And there’s a lot of stuff to unpack just on how they did make decisions. And so I’m happy to go over the basic framework of how they solved the problem of independence. Because I think one of the biggest things that we don’t know about the board is what it is, and what it is indebted to for Facebook, and what makes it plausibly independent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRbtBe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s step back for one second. So Facebook is a huge company. They operate a massive platform, several massive platforms, around the world. Their content moderation decisions have an enormous impact on people, on culture, on democracy. They wander into speech issues at a global scale where a team of people in the United States cannot plausibly understand it — speech issues in other countries that Facebook runs into at scale. You brought up human rights law, some of those things directly lead to horrible outcomes like genocides, literally, with Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55Wic8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg is unaccountable to the shareholders of Facebook, the corporate structure. So it’s a very unique company. He owns a majority of the shares. He can’t be removed as CEO, fundamentally. And so his solution is, “I’m going to set up a different thing to hold Facebook accountable and to review our content moderation decisions.” And it sounds like what you’re saying, the first problem is how do you create that thing to be independent? And how do you pay for it in a way that maintains its independence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyIbvQ"&gt;Yes, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGQU0U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did they solve that problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oevvZk"&gt;Well, that problem was interesting. So they decided to set up a Delaware trust corporation. They set up a Delaware trust corporation in October of 2019, and then the next day they arranged for that trust corporation to serve the Oversight Board, LLC, which is a limited liability corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJYHvK"&gt;The entire purpose of the trustees, and the entire purpose of the trust, was to administer a $130 million irrevocable grant that Facebook gave and then snipped the purse strings from, to this trust. It’s not an endowment. This is an important distinction because they cannot, actually, the trustees can’t invest the money. There’s no investment committee. It’s specifically not allowed. It’s not enough money to be able to endow it. It is enough money to probably have it run for five to six years, and then it is contemplated that there will be an endowment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pP40f"&gt;So there is the question of well, if they really do go at Facebook and really do hold Facebook accountable in some way, they are running the risk of having their funding cut off. But in the short term, six years feels like a long time, and this is what they were charged to do. So we’re seeing what the board is doing. But this is basically how it works. All of the board members and the administration are basically employees of the LLC, which is itself controlled by the trustees. So that’s how this breaks down from a business standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYBLP2"&gt;It was a fairly elegant solution. The trust documents are pretty interesting to read if you’re into that kind of thing, which I wasn’t but I had to do anyway. So I think there actually is, for right now, for the next five to six years, I think there is a fair amount of financial independence. We’ll see what happens four years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdsgNQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s on the Oversight Board? We keep talking about it like it’s a court. I don’t know if that’s correct. I want to get there. But they have some people who are making decisions and writing opinions and disagreeing. Who are those people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCmYgk"&gt;Right now the board is four co-chairs with a total of 20 members, that all are basically hearing cases related to user appeals that come out of Facebook on content moderation, or things that Facebook itself kicks to the board to review, like the Trump suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gMIQh"&gt;So those 20 individuals, it’s a pretty illustrious group of people. There’s a Nobel peace prize laureate, a former prime minister of Denmark, former editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, a former circuit court judge, a former Supreme Court clerk and Columbia law professor. Not to mention a ton of other people that are just experts in human rights law and lawyers and freedom of expression in their own right. So it’s a pretty well-staffed group that has a lot of experience, both with institution-building and freedom of expression and international human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tx6cKI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So for the Trump decision, did all of them hear it and vote, or was it a small group? I mean, normal courts, you go to the appeals court, they have a lot of judges, but the first three of them hear it, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YssX3"&gt;Yeah. Usually. So that’s precisely what happens here. So the process around hearing cases is a five-person, randomly selected, anonymous panel hears the case. And then right now how they basically have this working, because some of these things were not laid out in the bylaws and it’s up to the board to decide them on its own, is basically that right now the panel is writing up a draft of whatever it is that they determine is the right solution to the problem. After, they arrange and collect facts and ask people for more opinions and read all the briefs and everything else. And then they start circulating that. And a majority of the full board has to approve the final decision. And that was basically exactly how it worked for the Trump case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRvaIX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing that struck me reading the Trump decision is that it is anonymous. There’s frequent reference to the minority, and how the minority would have judged things differently. We don’t know who’s in the minority. We don’t know how big the minority is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwl0Kp"&gt;We don’t know how big but it can’t be bigger than nine people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2lSR3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sure. Yeah. But that’s a pretty big range from one to nine. And that’s all fine. So it’s pretty anonymous. And then the members of the Oversight Board are out in the world. They’re doing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT2Ne4J9UKY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interviews with Axios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. They’re doing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/events/deplatforming-trump-the-facebook-oversight-board-decision/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interviews at the Aspen Institute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. They’re publishing their own blog posts about this decision. I can’t quite understand what part of it is supposed to be anonymous and why, and what part of this is really public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CFXfD"&gt;Yeah. No one knows. That’s a great question. All day yesterday I was a little shocked at all of the different types of thoughts and collective pronouns that were being used when people were talking. One of the main reasons to have anonymity on a panel like this is that anonymity gives you a certain amount of intellectual privacy. The idea that you’re not going to be publicly shamed for being in the minority is pretty key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRQaar"&gt;The other thing is that these people that are on the board are all over the world. And a lot of the cases that they are touching on possibly pose really very real security risks to them, should their names be attached to the outcomes. And so that was another consideration for when all of this was being discussed about whether they should be anonymous or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2oefeI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If this was a court you wouldn’t be doing a TV hit to talk about what the conversation was like in chambers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5aHqq"&gt;What we didn’t know is whether there were going to be dissents. And so what’s super interesting here is that there’s no dissents. There is one decision and then they’ve decided to fold the idea of a dissent or a concurrence into these notions of a minority of the panel, a paragraph that says, “The minority of the panel felt differently about the reasonings for this.” So that was fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URnV6h"&gt;So that would be one thing, if it was just getting read from the bench and that’s all you heard about it, and you let the reasoning of the opinion or the decision stand on its own. But you didn’t. You then had everyone off tweeting all of their thoughts about everything and talking. And I think that that’s one of the things. I even asked one of the people who came on my show that day, I was like, “What’s going on?” If this was a court you wouldn’t be doing a TV hit to talk about what the conversation was like in chambers. That would be totally verboten. So it is like, “Well, are you a court? Because this sounds a lot like a court but you’re not exactly comporting yourself as a court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUah4x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know, the Supreme Court, doesn’t say, “Our big decision in this massive policy issue is coming out tomorrow at 9AM. Everybody get ready.” And then queue up its press hits. I keep coming back to that question. Is it a court? We’ve all called it this Facebook Supreme Court. It seems right, conceptually.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwEqLt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook has difficult decisions to make. It doesn’t seem to want to make them or be accountable for them so it’s going to kick them over to this other place. They will take the hit and Facebook will presumably do what they say. But if you’re going to be that kind of institution, there’s just a part of it where that’s not how courts actually act. But just conceptually, I can’t tell if this is a court or not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvJFr9"&gt;Yeah. I think they’re there with you. I think they’re still deciding what they want to do. So for example, just to put it right on the nose, they talked to me, a number of the board members, on condition of anonymity. They talked to me for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; piece explaining some of their first decisions and how they had reasoned through them and what they had thought. And that was a level of access that a court would not usually grant to a reporter or anything else. And after that, they decided not to do that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QONxpS"&gt;So there are changes that they’re making to their policy. It’s not set in stone. I’ve heard a lot of people wondering, “Well, this is an incredibly well-reasoned and rigorous legal opinion, so this is most definitely seeming like a court.” But the way that it’s being talked about by the people who are making this decision is not quite the same as what we expect to see out of courts that, traditionally, we’ve seen in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phQ9JH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the board’s power over Facebook? What can the board make Facebook do, specifically, if it’s unhappy with how Facebook is acting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Zwv5"&gt;So the power that the board has over Facebook is incredibly narrow, but it is a small devolution of power that I’ve always argued is actually a lot bigger than it seems. For right now, for content that is removed or kept up on Facebook, after a user has appealed it internally with Facebook, they can take that appeal and give it to the board. The board hears their case and makes the determination overturning Facebook’s decision to keep down the content or put it back up. And it’s only content, single-object content. It’s not even pages. That was a special thing that the board considered for Trump. Users can’t appeal their page takedowns right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yYhBz"&gt;Facebook agreed to adhere to whatever the board’s decision is on that specific piece of content. So my specific piece of content, my picture of my dog that gets accidentally removed from Facebook and the Oversight Board says it has to go back up, that has to go back up. But if you had also posted a picture of my dog and got it taken down, they have no obligation to restore your content. They have said that they will make efforts to restore similar content, but there’s no promise. That’s it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLcpAz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s very narrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n70c16"&gt;It’s super narrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3gU8K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they’re not actually saying whether the policies are right or wrong. They’re saying whether the enforcement of policies is right or wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F98ab8"&gt;Yes. But there is one other thing that they obligated themselves to do, which is that when the Oversight Board makes public policy recommendations, Facebook has obligated itself to respond within 30 days to the Oversight Board’s policy recommendations and whether they have been implemented or not, how they have been implemented, or if they weren’t implemented, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAMnUm"&gt;And this is this form of weak-form review, is something that Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet puts it this way. That it’s the court calling on basically the executive, the legislative body, to come back in and fix their problem, and then report back as to how they ended up doing that. And so that is actually also a pretty important reputational pressure that the board can put on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCdotg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this leads right into this decision. The simplest way of understanding this decision is:  The Capitol riots happened. Trump posted a bunch of videos and posts that ostensibly encouraged people to stop acting badly at the Capitol, kind of supported it, pretty messy, actually, in terms of just the straight interpretation of what Trump meant to have happen because of these videos and posts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEwKbk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook tries to take them down. And he tries again. They take them down and say, “&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re indefinitely banned from Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” This is the 6th and the 7th of January, a very chaotic time in America. All the other platforms are doing the same thing. Facebook then says, “Well, we got this board. We’re going to kick the indefinite ban of Trump to the board to see if that was the right decision.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCO9OW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the board comes back and they say, “Fine. It’s fine for you to have indefinitely banned him. We’re not going to write a policy for you on indefinite bans. Also, you have no policy on indefinite bans.” And they seem very unhappy with Facebook. There’s actually a tone to me in this decision that’s like, “Don’t put this on us.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rtmil"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5Lrkj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I think you could read that [as], “Come back to us in six months with a real decision. And we’ll tell you what to do.” And that reads to me as asserting its authority in a way, but it’s also really, really narrow and kind of punts the issue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9O7ZDY"&gt;I think it punts almost not at all, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6Jnnu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6zhYE"&gt;I think that that’s been one of the worst takes that’s come out of this. It’s not punting the issue at all. Because the issue’s coming back. What they’re saying is, we’re not going to carry water for you, Facebook. How I think about it is this, that one of the conceptions of what, as we’re talking about, what is this board? Is it a court? What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lh574O"&gt;One of the questions is what type of, level of, court is it going to be? If it’s a trial court, then it’s a fact-finding body and it does all of this work. And maybe it makes statutory interpretations of rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGeJ2U"&gt;Or is it more like a Supreme Court or court of appeals court, which is going to actually review the law and whether the law matched the facts of the thing? And what we see out of this decision is they are doing all three. I want to just hit on this really quickly. You talk about the fact that they lay out the events of the 6th and the 7th of January and that those were really hectic, crazy times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lZuy0"&gt;Do you know what a gift it is to have a cogent, rigorous, well-researched record of everything that we know happened on the front end, but matching that with Facebook going on the record in the backend of what it was doing and how they were doing this? For the last 20, 15 years, we’ve only had people leak stuff out of the companies to tell us this type of thing. There has been no process for this. It was like a breath of fresh air to have that to resource going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSevhk"&gt;But that’s kind of a trial court type of hat. And so then they kind of get into this appellate court type of hat. And they’re like, “No, we’re not a legislature for you. And our mandate is to see what your rules are and whether or not they were consistent with your values and international human rights standards. And if you don’t have a rule, we can’t do that. And we’re not going to make one for you because that’s not our job. And we know what you’d like us to do. You’d like us to basically make this somebody else’s problem for you. But we’re not going to do that. And we resent that you would even ask us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83ZSqx"&gt;And I just thought it was a powerful, powerful response, really rooted in the rule of law and procedure, instead of getting sucked into the vortex of intractable online speech problems and the definition of newsworthiness and public figures and things like that, [which] is never going to get you anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSwEeB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push back on that. I find myself really wondering what the limit of authority for this Oversight Board is. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j57sTD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think they punted specifically because they said, “You need to come up with a proportionate response to Trump’s actions and come back to us in six months with that response based on any rule,” which sounds like, “Someone’s got to reinstate Trump to Facebook and it’s not going to be us. We’re telling you that an indefinite ban is not acceptable. There’s no rule that says indefinite bans exist. But we’re not going to tell you the term of an indefinite ban.”  The temptation to say that the board claimed for itself a greater authority by not making a decision is very high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TyIya"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see a lot of lawyers making that comparison to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marbury v. Madison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in the Supreme Court. There’s this big historical parallel that seems very tempting. But here, narrowly, it’s just like, they didn’t want to be the ones to put Trump back on Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgxlec"&gt;Yeah, I think that that’s probably also right. So here’s what I’ll say about what the term proportionality means in an international human rights context. Which is basically, the idea of proportionality is that you have some type of ability to atone for your punishment, or you have some type of proportionate response to whatever it is, the underlying problematic act that you’ve committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmmE1i"&gt;And it’s not clear to me that it is possible to have a permanent suspension of someone’s freedom of expression on a platform, or ability to be on a platform, and have it ever be consistent with international human rights standards. A permanent suspension is basically de facto disproportionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9pHMf"&gt;But I think that it’s a good argument. Because I do think that may be right. But they want that finality of that decision. They want Facebook to have said that that’s what’s at stake. And they don’t want to have to say it for them. And maybe it’s like punting the issue because they don’t want to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85VUOU"&gt;But they’re going to have to deal with it one way or the other when this comes back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3p8ei"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this is where I think that the wishy-washiness really gets me. Shouldn’t they have said, you’ve got to un-ban him until you come up with a rule that would properly ban him, as opposed to this reflexive reaction to, something bad’s happening and he’s making it worse. And we’re going to turn him off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zvf4eq"&gt;Yes. But I think that it’s so messy. But this is almost an interesting question of administrative law, which is that they defer to the decision of the underlying body. Right? And so, they agreed that they made the right decision at the time to take him down. And it’s not clear that enough time has passed, that that problem of imminence, or dangerous organization affiliation, or lauding dangerous organizations are passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGfpwW"&gt;And so that was the other part; “Well, we can’t make that decision. You have to do that.” That part was the puntiest of all of it, I think. You’re right. They could have basically reached some type of determination that was the opposite, around the ban. And that part, they absolutely did put it back on Facebook to do something one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaZguk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that really came up in this decision a lot was the board asked Facebook, “Have you ever applied this exception called the newsworthiness exception to Trump, where he’s doing something that breaks your rules, but because he’s the president and he’s newsworthy, you’re giving him a pass?” Everyone assumed that Facebook, this was their justification. Facebook said, “No, we’ve never applied the newsworthiness exception,” which, A, I know you have some strong feelings about newsworthiness as a concept, but, B, that is a big surprise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rsqy4B"&gt;It’s not a surprise, because I don’t think that they’re lying. I think that they didn’t technically apply their newsworthy exception to Trump. Trump is instead on a special list of newsworthy people, so it’s a different standard. They didn’t lie. They have different rules for different types of people, for people that are high-profile, people who have certain numbers of followers. We’ve known this for a long time. We’ve never had access to this list. We don’t know how it’s administered. We don’t know what goes into deciding content that those individuals say, necessarily. So this is one of the best parts of this, is kind of, “You have to tell us how this all works, because this doesn’t make sense to us, and it seems like you made it up as you went along.” So this isn’t a standard at all, and so we can’t even review it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="VuS84U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s always been nuclear to moderate Trump&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gk6ahO"&gt;I think that this is great, because, I mean, I wrote a paper in 2018 called &lt;a href="https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1292&amp;amp;context=faculty_publications"&gt;Facebook v. Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, which kind of was supposed to be a little play on New York Times v. Sullivan, which established the public figure and newsworthiness kind of considerations in First Amendment law. It toyed with this idea of, “Well, how are they possibly defining newsworthiness and public figures?” I talked to a number of former policy people that had left the company in 2013 specifically around this newsworthiness question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCRGGN"&gt;Because they thought that this was an intractable standard that could never be consistently applied and was always going to be a question of, “Newsworthy to who?” That was always going to be a group of people in Silicon Valley, and that was bullshit. Then a group of people that ended up being the winners, just wanted to use it as a way to ad hoc make determinations on a case-by-case basis. I love that it’s coming up and that this is something that the board raised, because I think it’s just absolutely fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh1ljE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That special list that Trump was on, we don’t know how big it is, right? But Trump, his relationship to Facebook and to Twitter, he’s always sort of gotten his own space, right? It’s always been nuclear to moderate Trump in any way, shape, or form until it crossed the threshold of January 6th. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp3YYu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this decision from the board saying, “You can’t have those kinds of soft exceptions anymore. You have to treat everybody the same,” or is it, “If you’re going to have exceptions, you have to be clear about them”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdQmzw"&gt;I would say the latter, but I don’t know. They might say that it does not comport with international human rights law and principles of law to have two different sets of speech rules for people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoAXCo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if you’re the President of the United States?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNxIHJ"&gt;Even if you’re the President of the United States. Or they might say that you are allowed to have different classes and types of things, but you have to be consistent about what classes people are in, and you have to tell us what it means to be put into this class. I mean, so one of the things that I wrote about with some of my research is at some point, they used to define public figures by the number of Google hits you had or the number of times you showed up in Google News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZBkkF"&gt;They would use Google to determine whether or not someone was a public figure or a combination of that and how many people followed you on the platform. But these are standards that...they changed all the time. I have no idea where that standard is now, because we’ve had no transparency into how it changed or where it’s gotten into. So I don’t know. I’m excited for this conversation to have gotten to such a sophisticated place finally, after the last 10 years of nonsense, and yeah, I’m really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUbW3o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s just a part of this where Facebook gets to pretend it’s the most important thing in the world all the time. And it’s created this board. And here we are talking about it as though it’s a supreme court.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmjUj6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And right next door is Twitter. And they’re like, “Yeah, we’re just banning the guy. He’s gone. We’re not telling you if he’s ever coming back. Maybe he’ll never come back. You’re just never going to know.” And there’s no process by which Trump or any of his team can appeal that decision because Twitter is a private company, it’s their platform. They can do what they want. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1Sbck"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook is trying to create this other thing that provides moral, legal, spiritual justification for a snap decision. I just can’t tell if that is correct, or whether it’s fundamentally distracting, or whether everyone should have a giant oversight board.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFjVOF"&gt;Yeah. I mean, I think that all of those things are the things to be thinking about. I think that that’s all I’ve been thinking about for the last two years. But I’ve been by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfNoW8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why I wanted to talk to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TH26G6"&gt;So this is so much nicer than just sitting in my apartment, staring at my dog being like, “Why won’t you tell me what to do about the Facebook Oversight Board?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKMOfb"&gt;So I think that that’s completely correct. So the way that I think about this is that Facebook has basically chosen a path of governance. They are in — and so is Twitter — an intractable kind of situation in which they are forced to make these terrible content moderation decisions that govern and have huge public ramifications and that compromise human rights, like freedom of expression and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdegtH"&gt;And at the same time, they’re privately held companies. And they’re privately held companies that operate transnationally and in the exchange of information. And so they are basically, they are a pretty big deal. They’re pretty much outside, in strength and power, outside the ability of any one country to shut them down everywhere. Not even the United States could shut down Facebook or Twitter everywhere. They could shut it down in the United States briefly if they really wanted to. But that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfzNHa"&gt;And so I think that, you have to galaxy-brain yourself a little bit and make yourself go to a new place of, what is the world going to look like if entities like this exist? And they’re governing public rights? And we need to figure out a way to democratize or hold accountable private companies governing public rights, especially when there’s public rights like freedom of expression, or rights that you have traditionally excepted from government control. Because governments are traditionally bad at telling us what to do with our speech, and dangerous when they tell us what to do with our speech. So it’s hard to make government the solution to this either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RjlcYh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Oversight boards could become mandated by the government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yUxAG5"&gt;And so I think that Facebook chose a governance path with the Oversight Board. And I think that they hoped that they would be shoving off these substantive decisions. What we saw yesterday was that that didn’t work out quite the way that they thought, or at least it isn’t so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYfIe1"&gt;I mean, there’s a couple of things that could happen out of this. The Oversight Board could be a total distraction. We never get anywhere with it. It gets disbanded in five years or whatever. But at least it was a pretty noble experiment and gave us a new valence or way of thinking about how to solve some of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udi8bc"&gt;The other thing is that it could take hold in the idea of people being entitled to boards like this, or [that] being able to avail themselves of boards like this becomes something that is either mandated and regulated by governments — right now Canada’s contemplating mandating the creation of oversight boards within their country for these speech platforms — or it’s something that the public simply demands of these speech platforms. And they have to put them in place themselves, and Twitter gets forced into it because it becomes the next wave of how we deal with platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osAhED"&gt;I have no idea. I think about this all the time. But I think that, at least for now, it looks like the Oversight Board is pretty serious. It really could have been people taking their checks and rubber-stamping Facebook’s decisions. And it could have been nothing. But a 40-page decision that cites international human rights law and outs Facebook for not answering questions that were posed to it after it created this board to begin with. I think that this is a pretty serious — Well, right now, it looks like a pretty serious group and decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyDaiY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the board submits a bunch of questions to Facebook as part of its Trump decision-making process. Facebook just says, “We’re not going to answer seven of your questions.” Is Facebook allowed to just not answer the board’s questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UD1wK7"&gt;See, I love this. This is like, people and my students are being like, “Is this legal? Can they do this?” And I’m like, “Anything is legal or not legal until someone tells you not to do it.” Can they do this? Well, they just did. And I don’t know what we do to stop them. I mean, what we do to stop them is the board tells them they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaLLJ9"&gt;And the board did that as much as they could, and they made it public, and it’s not been well-received that they didn’t answer those questions. And I think that there is probably definitely a number of people at Facebook right now that are panicked over how to move forward with more requests from the board in the future. But If you think about it from the perspective of, if a government was called before a court to answer questions and the government said, “I’m really sorry, court, we can’t tell you.” It just wouldn’t fly. You’d be in contempt of court. That’s the end of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75ict4"&gt;I think that the interesting thing here is that it ends up being a real question of legal realism and public pressure and reputation for the company, like how bad it’s going to look if they spent $130 million in two years and 20 brilliant people’s time to do this, and then they don’t pay any attention to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUatp9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things that strikes me as you describe that process is, the United States Supreme Court likes to say that it makes very narrow decisions, but it actually has sweeping authority over American public life. Should our schools be segregated or not? The Supreme Court said not. And they kind of make these decisions that have sweeping impact over our lives. And they actually kind of restructure society. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QJjog"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The board’s power here is limited to, “Well, you took something down, but you should put it back up.” And it seemed like in this decision, they want the additional power to say, “How does your algorithm work? What do you see your algorithm promoting or disincentivizing or otherwise modifying in the conversations had on Facebook? And how does your business model plug into that algorithm and how do you make decisions about it?” And they just don’t have that power, and it seems like they really want it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PGT1n"&gt;Completely. I also got that out of the opinion. I was in the House of Lords testifying about the Oversight Board with Alan Rusbridger, who’s on the board, former editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. He basically said in his House of Lords testimony was that they were coming after the algorithm. And I was like, “That’s interesting. That wasn’t in the charter.” And so it was kind of foreshadowed, but I saw that in the opinion as well and I think that it’s really interesting, and I think that it is absolutely the right question because as Jack Balkin says, it’s the crown jewels of how all of this works and what the real power source of Facebook is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXT9DC"&gt;I know for a fact, because I’ve read the founding documents so many times, that it is not contemplated at all that they’ll have any type of visibility into that, but I’ve always argued that that doesn’t mean anything. Just for the same reason you’re talking about it not being legal, there’s no reason that they can’t use their public pressure and authority and sway, which is really all that it is, to start asking these hard questions. And I think this is pretty soon to do it, but I think that it’s great that they’re going in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhKPq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That leads me into the connection between, maybe five years from now every company will want an oversight board, or governments will demand that you have such a contraption connected to your company. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1T0qtU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if your expertise and your precedent is all about Facebook’s algorithm, then how on Earth can you connect that to TikTok or connect that to YouTube, which have wildly different business models, wildly different algorithmic inputs and outputs? These are different products. They have different formats. They have different business pressures. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcbLxW"&gt;Oh, you don’t. And I would actually say that that would be the worst possible outcome is to have one oversight board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgwfJD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I think this one kind of wants to be the one oversight board. They don’t even call themselves the Facebook Oversight Board. They’re just the Oversight Board.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeQjoV"&gt;That’s true. I thought that that was weird. And honestly, you want to know why I think that they did that? I think that they all are so...the name Facebook is so toxic that I think that they don’t want to be associated with it by name. And so this is something I read about in the &lt;em&gt;Yale Law Journal &lt;/em&gt;article that I went into, which is the different ways that this could play out. And one of the ways is that basically, the trust corporation that I’ve mentioned before, that Twitter dumps $130 million into that and forms their own oversight board to apply Twitter’s terms of service and Twitter’s community standards to whatever it is that Twitter wants to set those at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9mmqv"&gt;Or, Twitter makes its own, which is just as easy, I think. Twitter makes its own trust and its own oversight board and endows that and does their own thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1H0Ai"&gt;And finally, the last thing is I think it would be terrible for freedom of expression globally if we started to have one set of merged standards that came together, that were all the same industry standard and that you couldn’t have nudity on one platform and no nudity on another platform, or something like that, if that’s what you decided. I think the differentiation is key to preserving freedom of expression. But I think that you’re exactly right. That’s one of the things that was specifically contemplated by Zuckerberg when he started to create these documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4cnhn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right. I think he said, “Well, maybe someday, other companies will use our board.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAWt9t"&gt;He literally made the documents so that you could control-F, replace all, Facebook for Twitter. They’re really meant to be usable breakouts for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4ZHQ9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I mostly agree with you that it would be bad to have one weird public, quasi-private entity controlling all speech in America. It just seems bad on its face. On the flip side, there’s just an enormous amount of instability in people’s expectations of what they can do on services. The First Amendment means that it’s a free-for-all, which is good. The government can’t make speech regulations. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbVvBH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the idea that Twitter will take something down and Facebook won’t, and YouTube will demonetize a creator for doing pranks that are too dangerous, and TikTok — people accuse TikTok, literally the algorithm of TikTok, of being racist all the time. I hear from the audience all the time that “I don’t know what’s going to happen. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gplVuk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are the rules these platforms have to abide by from a baseline?” And I think that’s how you get to this very popular political posturing that we should just impose the First Amendment, and they’ve got to do whatever the First Amendment says, which is somewhat nonsensical. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCXZD7"&gt;It’s not somewhat. It is literally nonsense, gobbledygook. It doesn’t make sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehJjd9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But I’m very sympathetic to where that comes from, that you’re going to go seek out some other authority that has this spiritual place in American life, and then everyone has to just do that. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqO40s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. I understand the impulse, but I don’t know how to square it with, these are different companies with different roles, different algorithms. And yeah, if Twitter wants to be a little looser with its nudity standards than Facebook, that is actually a good thing for speech in America.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU7qPy"&gt;I understand the impulse. I’m going to be really mean about people for a second. I understand the impulse to stop, to turn off your brain and take the easiest possible solution that gives you absolutely meaningless results and won’t have any type of procedural fairness over time. Sure. That seems great. We did that with newsworthiness. Newsworthiness is a circularly defined concept that people rely on all the time and it actually means nothing. And it’s time we finally started talking about that. And just because the Supreme Court uses the language and circularly defines it still doesn’t mean that it’s not a problem philosophically to rely on that for a standard to police people’s speech on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1HSsW"&gt;I really do understand the notion that people want there to be some answer out there that is going to solve this problem, but here’s the thing. You just were talking about this in the US and the First Amendment. Facebook’s global user base is 7 percent in the US; mostly it’s everywhere else. This isn’t even other people’s standards. Facebook talks about itself as a community. It’s not a community. It is a couple billion communities all overlapping on top of each other, that have almost that necessarily binds them together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhIM97"&gt;A community is defined by a group of individuals that have a shared sense of norms and values and responsibilities. And there’s no global community that can even agree on whether we should allow female breasts online, let alone whether or not to allow when a Mexican cartel has a beheading, whether or not to let someone put that on a platform or whether it’s too violent or it’s gore, or whether we should do something in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUi4DA"&gt;This is one of the other things that I’m excited about about this decision is because I think it starts to go to a place that is so much more useful and rigorous than how we’ve been having this conversation for the last 10, 15 years, which is that it is time to stop letting people make these, “Oh, he’s a public figure. Oh, he’s a political figure. Oh, he’s newsworthy,” types of arguments and stop there. It’s time to get to the next level and dig deeper and figure out what it is we value and mean by that. And to your point about all this stuff about TikTok being racist, Twitter making arbitrary decisions, all of this stuff. Those have grounded, intuitive roots in procedural justice and the rule of law that we can start to tie some of these things back to. And if we could start to have procedures around some of this stuff, then once we apply the substantive rules, they won’t seem so arbitrary and capricious and these companies won’t seem so unaccountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUtaRY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s interesting about that is we keep coming back to the laws and courts, which are fundamentally governmental functions and powers. At least in this country, there’s just not a way to have a speech court like that. So these all have to be corporate powers and enforcement mechanisms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuiatE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least here in America in 2021, I cannot see everyone coming together and agreeing that this corporation, this LLC, has the power over speech on one of the largest platforms, and that its decisions are going to carry the psychic weight of a Supreme Court decision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HDVAk"&gt;Well, to your point, pretty much the US courts have passed the buck on this all the time. They don’t make decisions on the substantive nature of viewpoint discrimination. They just say, “There can or can not be viewpoint discrimination, and this is how we’re going to determine this.” I think that what you’re going to see is that Facebook’s going to still get to substantively decide what its policies are, but they’re just going to have to be fair and consistent and proportionate in how they enforce them. And right now, that is the biggest hurdle, that people who have worked around content moderation are the most upset about; it’s not that Trump comes up or comes down when he incites violence or lauds a dangerous org. It’s that there is a different rule for you and for me, and for Trump and for Alex Jones, and that we don’t know what any of those decisions are, any of those rules are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7aCznF"&gt;People are constantly having unfair outcomes. I think it was an 80 percent error rate on content moderation decisions. I’m just like,”That’s nuts.” Can we just work on getting that lower for a while, never mind keeping Trump down? That’s a lot of people that are censored. At the end of the day, this is really about just establishing some procedures. The substantive decisions, you’re right, everyone’s going to fight about them. No one’s going to be happy about them. There’s lots of laws people don’t agree with now, too, but they feel protected by the fact that there’s transparency and accountability of how they’re enforced. Well, kind of, depending on plenty of other systemic things, but that’s kind of something that I think that we can get into once we have this baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOZ203"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned the error rate of moderation decisions. Connect this spectrum for me. We’ve done a lot of coverage of individual moderators at Facebook and their working conditions and how they feel, and the fact that they have fundamentally bad jobs and often get PTSD afterwards. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBYmpx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should a contractor working in a Facebook moderation shop feel about the Oversight Board? What is the relationship that they should have? And what is the relationship they have now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07kC0v"&gt;Oh, I think they should be very excited about this. And in fact, one of the most interesting series of calls I got yesterday, or a text that I got yesterday from people that were inside the company, inside Facebook, were from people, as I would call it, in the factory floor or in the policy shop, that were very happy because they had agitated for these types of changes for a long time and felt like this gave them the clout and authority that they needed to put forward this rigorous, new agenda and not have a series of trying to rework the same terrible, ad hoc rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWKtA7"&gt;And so I think that that’s going to filter down to content moderators and their job being easier. I will say that I think that it continues to be something that we need to talk about and the fact that we are outsourcing this labor in this way and that we’re using individuals to cleanse things. We still talk about it like there is this...you talk about the algorithm — either from data that people are generating from even being on the site and where their eyeballs are going, to people making the content moderation decisions — I think that probably the algorithm is less sophisticated than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8LDcA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside of Facebook, one thing that we’ve heard a lot about is the content moderation shop is connected to their political operation shop; that the lobbyists of Facebook are the people who write the rules for speech on Facebook, and that is deeply problematic. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWARwZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s gestured at in this opinion, but they’ve now kicked it back to that same shop, which has faced any number of controversies over the years. Is that something that Facebook needs to change to make all of this more credible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrayNB"&gt;I have heard that they’re starting to. I heard this through other people who have heard this, so this is getting deep into kind of hearsay and just kind of rumor mill inside Silicon Valley. But I think that they are definitely wanting to devolve product and policy more distinctly. I think that that’s been happening for a while, and I think the Oversight Board is a huge part of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWb8Zr"&gt;But I think that also, they are trying to get away from the idea that Joel Kaplan is in charge of so much and doing so much and trying to put more onto Nick Clegg. I think that the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/technology/facebook-trump-nick-clegg.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article that came out today&lt;/a&gt; is kind of part of that. I think that there is a desire to kind of set Nick up more for being a policy head. I mean, I think that’s maybe it’s too little, too late, but I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MD63k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we’re looking at this whole sweep of the Oversight Board being created, this big decision being referred to it, it asserting itself in saying, “No, you actually have to make a policy,” kicking it back to Facebook. In six months, they’ll send it back to the Oversight Board. What should regular Facebook users be looking for next from this process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIsO13"&gt;One of the things that’s been lost in all of the nonsense around Trump, and honestly, I know that people are like, “The Oversight Board is a distraction.” I feel like Trump is a distraction. I mean, for always and for all time, he has been a distraction from so much, but also from [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and from [Brazilian President Jair] Bolsonaro and all of the other leaders that are still in power that are threatening, and still on Facebook. I think that this is just one moment. So I think the next thing that users can expect is that whatever happens coming out of this next six months is going to have a huge impact on other types of world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elqqOb"&gt;The other thing I was going to say is that one of the things that’s been lost in all of the emphasis on the Trump suspension is that in the last couple of weeks, Facebook actually had implemented something that they had promised to do eventually, but we never knew how soon or when, which was to start putting their decisions to keep up content that had been flagged by other users into the jurisdiction of the board on appeal. So this means that if I find something that you said offensive and I flag it to Facebook as being lauding dangerous organizations or inciting violence, and they say, “No, it’s fine. We decided to leave it up,” I can now appeal that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj2uSN"&gt;I think that that’s a huge deal, because it puts the board into both the role of being watchers of the censors and now being the censors themselves, basically being like, “No, that speech is too harmful. It has to come down.” I think that that’s actually going to be a really weird thing for a lot of these people to do, because I think a lot of these people are used to being like, “No, that has to go back up for the sake of freedom of expression.” I think it’s going to be a lot harder to take down certain people’s speech when it’s harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dlhTf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I think you actually see that in the Trump decision where, as they keep referencing the minority, they keep saying, “The minority would have gone farther.” That balance to me seems incredibly fascinating. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLjRRO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate, I suspect we’re going to have you back on the show a lot as the Facebook Oversight Board continues its metamorphosis into something credible. Thank you so much for being on the show.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhf57w"&gt;Thank you so much for having me. Well, it was really fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Getting hospitals ready for the next pandemic</title>

  &lt;p&gt;The more hospitals cooperate, the better they’ll fare in an emergency&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PyOnrn"&gt;As surges of COVID-19 cases spread throughout the United States over the past year, hospitals overwhelmed with patients quickly ran out of everything: masks, gloves, beds, space, doctors, nurses. Hospital workers in New York City, one of the first epicenters of the US pandemic, wore &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/nurse-dies-coronavirus-mount-sinai.html"&gt;garbage bags&lt;/a&gt; as protective equipment. Patients in overcrowded California emergency rooms spent hours lying in &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-31/l-a-county-hospital-hit-breaking-point-no-one-would-believe-this-is-in-the-united-states"&gt;hallways&lt;/a&gt;. Nurses in Missouri worked &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/health/covid-hospitals-overload.html"&gt;twice the normal number&lt;/a&gt; of shifts to make up for sick colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfBH5o"&gt;The catastrophe was clear early on in the pandemic, and experts gave clear warning that &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-hospitals"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200317.457910/full/"&gt;weren’t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-covid-19-forecasts-us-hospitals-could-be-overwhelmed-second-week-april-demand-icu"&gt;going&lt;/a&gt; to be enough hospital beds available for everyone who needed one. But even with that warning, there wasn’t enough time to build up capacity before the wave of COVID cases broke and the demand far outstripped supply, particularly in intensive care units. In the end, hospitals were only able to withstand the surge with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/health/doctors-nurses-covid-stress.html"&gt;considerable cost&lt;/a&gt; to overworked doctors and nurses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpwwnw"&gt;Now that the immediate emergency is subsiding, those same hospital and ICU beds are getting a closer look. COVID-19 won’t be the last threat to stress-test the country’s fragmented, private health care infrastructure. But getting hospitals ready for the next disaster isn’t just a matter of spending money. Real preparation will require changing the way hospitals work together, changing them from isolated enterprises into a collaborative network — in other words, thinking of hospitals as infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i2GlRv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Real preparation will require changing the way hospitals work together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D4J0LE"&gt;With Biden’s infrastructure push gearing up, that rethinking may have to come soon. &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/"&gt;As it makes the case for the American Jobs Plan&lt;/a&gt;, the White House has talked about making hospital networks more resilient, alongside similar efforts in food systems, transportation, and the electric grid. But the only tangible measure detailed in the bill is new funding for VA hospitals, the only public medical facilities directly operated by the federal government. If no new measures are added, the White House may end up missing its chance for the more profound change many experts say is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51SrbF"&gt;“I think that there probably needs to be a re-analysis of the day-to-day healthcare resources of communities, and rethinking those with the idea of a surge in mind,” says Michael Redlener, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. “The healthcare system is designed to meet everyday needs. It’s not really conceived of as something for a surge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJUpeM"&gt;The simplest physical signal of how ready our hospitals were for COVID-19 was the number of beds they had ready for sick people. Before the pandemic, the US had around 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people, according to &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/101864/hospital-readiness-for-covid-19_1.pdf"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt;, which is far fewer than countries like Germany, France, and Japan. Each day, most of those beds were full, which didn’t leave much slack in the system for a sudden influx. Some states had less room than others: Connecticut, for example, only had 0.45 unoccupied beds per 1,000 people, according to the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUigW6"&gt;Those numbers used to be higher: over the past few decades, the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people in the US has &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/system/files/research/reports/tw/chartbook/2016/2016chartbook.pdf"&gt;steadily declined&lt;/a&gt;. Hospitals have eliminated beds, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/01/24/hospital-chains-services-consolidation/"&gt;health care systems&lt;/a&gt; have closed down inpatient care centers, and small, independent hospitals have &lt;a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/the-case-of-the-disappearing-hospital-beds/427211/"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt;. The trend is particularly acute in rural areas, where &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2021-01-21-gao-rural-hospital-closures-reduce-access-care"&gt;over 100 hospitals&lt;/a&gt; have closed since 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvvRE8"&gt;In large part, that decline is a feature of the US for-profit health system, which pushes hospitals to keep overhead low. Keeping a bed open and ready to go costs money; if there’s not a patient to fill it, it’s seen as a cost waiting to be cut. Building excess capacity can be bad for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UmgCBG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Keeping a bed open and ready to go costs money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14YjXu"&gt;“In a fee-for-service system, hospitals know what their patient flow looks like, and they’re prepared for that. They’re not always prepared for the worst case scenario,” says Fredric Blavin, a researcher in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute who studied hospital capacity at the start of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gesm1"&gt;On the flip side, keeping too many beds open could incentivize hospitals to fill them — giving potentially unnecessary care and costs to patients. Given that model, it isn’t realistic to maintain the space for hundreds of additional patients all the time, says Michelle Mello, who studies health law and health care delivery at Stanford Law School. For Mello, preparedness is more about improving communications between hospitals as they manage the resources they have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwcsJ1"&gt;Mello is based in Northern California and says that there wasn’t a good way to route patients to nearby hospitals if the one they showed up at was full. “There wasn’t a great system for sending the things you might need to take care of COVID-19 patients,” she says. The same was true in New York City, Redlener says. “If you talked to someone in Queens during the height of the pandemic, there weren’t enough ventilators for every patient who needed one. But if you looked at the region, there was probably enough capacity to take care of everyone,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmELTB"&gt;When COVID-19 cases surged in 2020, small hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. They &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/health/covid-hospitals-overload.html"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; to find larger medical institutions to transfer patients to. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-covid-surge-data-11601478409"&gt;no data system&lt;/a&gt; that offers easy visibility into the beds and resources available at various hospitals in the US, so hospital staff in many places relied on working the phones to find space for patients. In theory, the hospitals were coordinating with state and local health departments — but in practice, they were mostly operating on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ImHmBR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Those kinds of opportunities to sit together and to really appropriately allocate resources in an effective manner are extraordinarily helpful.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyCHl2"&gt;That lack of collaboration also makes economic disparities worse, since wealthy hospitals are more likely to have stockpiles of supplies on which they can rely. “A wealthy hospital might say, ‘I don’t know what’s coming, we could have a surge tomorrow, I don’t want to share.’ On aggregate, that creates huge inefficiencies because everyone’s looking out for their own good,” Mello says. “It cries out for a more cooperative approach.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A54VQI"&gt;A more cooperative plan might be modeled off of something like New York’s regional burn plans, which are designed to respond to a fire or disaster that leaves a large number of people with serious burns, Redlener says. Those plans involve groups like the fire department, burn centers, hospitals, and the Department of Health; they make sure that there’s a way to create beds for burn patients and have specialists available to see them. “A plan exists, and it thinks about everything in a multidimensional way,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpjJsJ"&gt;There have been some bright spots of collaboration over the past year, says Nancy Foster, the vice president for quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association: federal and state authorities worked with hospitals to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575207/antibody-treatment-distribution-limited-dose-coronavirus-treatment"&gt;distribute monoclonal antibody COVID-19 treatments&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Early evidence showed that the drug, which has to be given to people just after they’re diagnosed with COVID-19, can blunt the severity of illness. Rather than let individual states and hospitals order it, the US Department of Health and Human Services allocated it out to states based on the number of COVID-19 cases they had over the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="cmEdob"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ske1Cv"&gt;“Those kinds of opportunities to sit together and to really appropriately allocate resources in an effective manner are extraordinarily helpful,” Foster tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They’re part of what we have to think about going forward.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgRx85"&gt;Making sure that spirit of collaboration continues after the acute emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic, though, could be difficult — again, because the US health care system is private and institutions typically act independently. It’d be a challenge to mandate coordination from the federal level, but there could be incentives for organizations to participate, Mello says. “There are already efforts to do these things on a voluntary basis,” she says. That principle holds true for other types of emergency preparedness, like flexible staffing or better supply management, Redlener says. “There’s a balance, and a push-pull between mandates versus incentives to participate,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uLZHUO"&gt;But reinvesting in programs that would make the health care system more collaborative — and, therefore, more resilient — benefits everyone. “We truly don’t know what the features of the next disease will be and what the needs will be,” Mello says. “That should create incentives for people to cooperate and hedge their risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSpl0f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SteelSeries’ budget-friendly Rival 5 is packed with buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Rival 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1SDHvCFzo0P0po-SFLhq-N6f77U=/0x0:2764x1843/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267921/steelseriesrival3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Rival 5 costs $59.99 and is available now.&lt;/em&gt; | SteelSeries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yiA2Qo"&gt;SteelSeries has debuted its Rival 5 wired, right-handed gaming mouse that is available right &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frival-5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22428555%2Fsteelseries-rival-5-wired-gaming-mouse-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now for $59.99&lt;/a&gt;. From a distance, the Rival 5 looks similar to the modular Rival 600, but this is a simpler and slightly more ergonomically friendly mouse. The overall shape of the device seems to have a softer curve, making it fit a little more comfortably for palm or fingertip grip users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmoLP6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its 10-zone RGB lighting is something you’ll either love or want to deactivate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0kchmL"&gt;This mouse offers plenty of controls, starting with the primary mouse buttons, an RGB-backlit scroll wheel, and a DPI switcher. Two thumb buttons are near the concave thumb rest; they’re flanked by an interesting toggle bar that can be customized using SteelSeries’ software to execute an in-game command when you tilt it right or left. In addition, there’s a silver-colored side button that, in my brief testing, felt easy to reach and feel for in games. SteelSeries says this selection of buttons makes it adept for multiple gaming genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxCzya"&gt;The Rival 5 weighs 85 grams and features the company’s TrueMove Air optical sensor — the same one found in 2020’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21538891/steelseries-aerox-3-gaming-mouse-wireless-lightweight-honeycomb-water-resistant-usb-c"&gt;SteelSeries Aerox 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; and the Rival 3 Wireless. It’s also getting the main mouse switches that have an IP54 rating to protect against some water and dust; the company claims these can last for 80 million clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVNUZs"&gt;At $59.99, this seems like a good, budget-friendly option for people looking for a versatile mouse. We’ll be testing it more in the near future to see how it compares to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;best gaming mice of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The team behind Alto’s Adventure is launching a new app — and studio — aimed at kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qb5aqUehv3XXny9HvSFbI6hbhgI=/0x2:2000x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267932/Busy_Board.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Pok Pok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ow6zQR"&gt;Snowman is best-known for games like &lt;em&gt;Alto’s Adventure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Skate City&lt;/em&gt;, but soon the company will be exploring a very different realm: children’s apps. Today, Snowman announced an upcoming game called &lt;em&gt;Pok Pok Playroom&lt;/em&gt;, which will be launching on May 20th on the App Store. It’s a charming, minimalist experience aimed at kids between two and six, designed to encourage open-ended play through a handful of different digital toys. But &lt;em&gt;Pok Pok&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just an app, it’s also the name of a brand-new creative studio spun off from Snowman that will be explicitly focused on making these kinds of experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DnbtY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We couldn’t really find anything that was up to our standards.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aLCMZs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pok Pok&lt;/em&gt; has been in the works for several years. It started life as a side project for Esther Huybreghts and Mathijs Demaeght, who were working as artists at Snowman while also raising two young boys. (The two now serve as creative director and design director of Pok Pok, respectively.) They wanted to find something where they could work together and explore their creativity outside of their day jobs. At the same time, they were coming to grips with raising two children and figuring out how to introduce screentime in a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDQp4e"&gt;“We wanted him to have some screentime,” Huybreghts says of her youngest child. “When we started looking for an app, we had a high standard of what we wanted. We didn’t want anything addictive, or loud and overstimulating. We couldn’t really find anything that was up to our standards so we decided to build something ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yzccexuqyu-HjMQKod-tLjww7ug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505269/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Pok Pok&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kd5oRN"&gt;They showed it to their co-workers, and it wasn’t long before it became a full-time production and, eventually, the focus of a brand-new studio. “It was immediately interesting,” Snowman creative director Ryan Cash says. &lt;em&gt;Pok Pok Playroom&lt;/em&gt; features several different virtual toys, including things like a simple drawing tool and a board full of fun switches and buttons to play with. For the most part, the digital toys are inspired by real-world ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5LmgR"&gt;“We wanted to bring open-ended play to a device, and most of the toys we liked, in our real playroom, had that same open-endedness to them,” says Huybreghts. Melissa Cash, co-founder and CEO of Pok Pok, adds that “the choice to be inspired by some of these toys was very intentional, because these are timeless toys that have been in our lives for generations. We wanted &lt;em&gt;Pok Pok&lt;/em&gt; to have that same feeling of being a timeless toy that grows with your children. They’re designed to reveal more things as your kids become more curious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dOlWfw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted an app that was as hands-off as possible.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T2RF72"&gt;That idea of open-ended play is core to &lt;em&gt;Pok Pok&lt;/em&gt;. The games don’t feature high scores or fail states, or many other elements associated with a typical video game. Instead, much like a real-world pile of wood blocks or bucket full of die-cast cars, everything is left up to the player. “The goal starts with the child,” Huybreghts explains. “We don’t tell them what to do. Every game they play is led by them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SPjVA"&gt;In some ways, &lt;em&gt;Playroom&lt;/em&gt; is most interesting for the things it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; have. There are no in-app purchases to worry about — instead, the game will be available through a subscription of $3.99 a month or $29.99 per year, with a 14-day free trial. And the experience has been streamlined so that kids can play with it independently. That means no tutorials or text to trip them up, and a simple and clear UI where it only takes one or two taps to get to different places in the app. “It was a very conscious decision not to have any text, because we wanted an app that was as hands-off as possible,” Huybreghts notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wuczV0lOvfY5AeBS0V_AfG6AKZE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505274/iPad_RedBG_Town.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Pok Pok&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qG9Fc0"&gt;The team also worked closely with a range of advisors, including teachers, early childhood educators, and sensory experts from the US, Canada, and Australia who consulted on &lt;em&gt;Playroom&lt;/em&gt;. In one instance, for example, signs featuring gibberish text were removed based on feedback from advisors, so that young players wouldn’t get confused while they’re learning to recognize letters. “While we have worked very closely with them, they’ve never come to us with a really big critique, which would’ve been a bad reflection on us,” Huybreghts says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOGzdi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pok Pok Playroom&lt;/em&gt; launches next week, and the plan is to continue to update it after launch, hence the subscription. That means adding more elements to existing toys, as well as introducing new ones. The goal is to still remain relatively small and accessible even after these expansions. “We don’t want to give kids the Netflix problem, where you’re just scrolling and scrolling and you go to bed because you can’t figure out what to watch,” says Melissa Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdHMqE"&gt;Cash notes that “a big part of our work starts when we launch,” as the team hopes to make changes and additions based largely on the feedback from players. But for Huybreghts and Demaeght, the launch of &lt;em&gt;Playroom&lt;/em&gt; also marks the end of one unexpected journey. What started as a quest to build an app to keep their own family occupied has turned into a brand-new company and commercial product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8RYlB"&gt;“It was never meant to be a big-budget project like this,” says Huybreghts. “If I had known, I would’ve added eyebrows and noses to the people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new Zephyrus M16 has a 16:10 screen and Intel Tiger Lake H processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 open, angled slightly to the left on a black background. The screen displays the ROG logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEYP-K070BvEpKCkWMrefCjSdlM=/0x500:3000x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267812/M16_04_bk.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3A73MN"&gt;If you’re wondering why every company under the sun has released new gaming laptops today, it’s because Intel has announced its newest flagship mobile processors. They’re the newest members of its 11th Gen “Tiger Lake H” series. Asus and Intel have announced the new Zephyrus M16, which will pair the chips with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3000 GPUs (up to a 3070). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Btef5m"&gt;What’s exciting about the M16 is that it has a QHD, 165Hz display with a 16:10 aspect ratio. 16:10 is highly unusual to see in gaming laptops; it’s more commonly found in business and productivity machines due to the extra vertical space it provides. Asus hopes the new look will help the Zephyrus line reach content creators and other customers seeking a device that can work as well as game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bScRrw"&gt;“It takes gaming laptops to an audience that wouldn’t have gone to a gaming laptop,” says Sascha Krohn, Asus ROG’s director of PC and laptop technical marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RubiMh"&gt;The slim-bezeled M16 has been around two years in the making. “It’s really tricky to do a laptop with super slim bezels, because you have to design the laptop around that screen,” Krohn said. The M16 has a 94 percent screen-to-body ratio, meaning it has smaller bezels in relation to its size than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; and almost any other consumer laptop on the market. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;, for comparison, has just above an 80 percent screen-to-body ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxw6rH"&gt;Asus’ G-series (including the renowned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;) will remain the more “mainstream” Zephyrus options going forward. The M16 is more expensive, and the Intel chip enables features that enthusiasts and content creators may value more, including Thunderbolt and Intel’s Quick Sync as well as the 16:10 display. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 open, seen from above. The screen displays the ROG logo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YM7_CZ3JJiEcFVDcVNzUKQAwdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22503922/M16_web_07psd_bk.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpNDIq"&gt;Intel worked closely with Asus to equip the M16 with a number of modern features, including Dolby Atmos audio with Intel’s Smart Sound Technology Driver and MS Hybrid Mode. Mainly, the company believes its CPUs will provide enough power to take advantage of the 165Hz QHD display, a feat that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;only really became possible this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3GcLW"&gt;“We’re really ensuring that we continue to deliver the gaming performance that we had in 10th-Gen, where we outgamed the competition earlier this year, and focused on making sure that your IPC gains and our single-threaded performance is at the level that we expect it,” says Kim Algstam, Intel’s interim GM of premium and gaming notebooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ko90zy"&gt;Algstam also claims the new Tiger Lake chips will be better at multithreaded workloads and will outpace the competition (read: AMD) on battery life, which is an important consideration for the M16’s target audience. “We’ve spent incredible time making sure that the performance tuning and battery life tuning is up to expectations,” Algstam says. “Customers want to do more than just game. They want to work, they want to do more personal tasks when they’re out and about, and that happens on battery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1wUvV"&gt;AMD has set a high bar in that regard. The Ryzen-powered Zephyrus G15 and Zephyrus G14 were two of the longest-lasting gaming laptops I’ve ever reviewed. Many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;comparable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;10th Gen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21459895/alienware-m15-r3-gaming-laptop-review-intel-rtx-nvidia-15-inch"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;systems&lt;/a&gt; have lasted significantly less time in our testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDLNx7"&gt;The elephant in the room is Alder Lake, Intel’s next generation of hybrid chips, which are slated for release in the second half of this year. The company called the new line “a significant breakthrough in x86 architecture” at a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225514/intel-12th-gen-hybrid-alder-lake-chips-2h-ces-2021"&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; in January. Should enthusiasts wait for that? Algstam didn’t address Alder Lake directly but did give a clear verdict. “I would definitely not wait,” he says. “I would buy today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuD4S2"&gt;Asus has not yet announced pricing or a release date for the Zephyrus M16. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti can deliver 60fps gameplay in more budget-friendly laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX 3050" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wOld_MheZWPN5E1ajT3BkxkQ9g=/0x1:2048x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267535/rtx3050lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fA2Hn"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 30-series lineup of mobile graphics chips has two new members joining today: the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti and 3050. They sit beneath the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;GeForce RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; in terms of specs and performance, with less video memory (4GB) and fewer dedicated Tensor AI and RT cores available to perform ray tracing and handle AI-enhanced effects like DLSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqPRdG"&gt;Despite this, Nvidia says that the RTX 3050 Ti is capable of going beyond 60fps in games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;— all with ray tracing settings on. That’s pretty good, considering it’ll show up in gaming laptop starting at $849. The RTX 3050 will appear in laptops starting at $799. We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407647/samsungs-galaxy-book-odyssey-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Book Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; will feature these graphics chips, starting at $1,399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxKSEq"&gt;There are caveats. To begin with, Nvidia’s benchmark measured this level of performance with graphics set to medium, with medium ray tracing settings enabled, and with DLSS on and set to quality mode. It’s entirely possible that many games set to high graphics settings (and minimal or no ray tracing) might also perform well with the RTX 3050 Ti, but this graphics chip seems best suited for people who don’t mind knocking down some quality settings to get smooth gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFsQGwT4l-HpqqKAMsolTV_gi1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19814059/04C_IN_GAME_MODES_BR_TOUT.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;According to Nvidia, the 3050 Ti can run &lt;/em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;em&gt; at well above 60 frames per second if DLSS is on.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAxuvV"&gt;The RTX 3050 Ti serves as yet another flex of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17854230/nvidia-rtx-2080-turing-architecture-specs-platform"&gt;Nvidia’s DLSS feature&lt;/a&gt; that, with the help of its AI cores, is able to run games faster than the hardware normally could. It does this in supported games by turning down the resolution, then using a trained AI model to enhance the picture quality on the fly without a perceptible (in most cases) difference in how the game looks. It promises big gains in performance with little in the way of disadvantages, unless you’re really dissecting pixels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sonst5"&gt;Again, this is a great argument in favor of these two GPUs, but it only works if your games have been patched to support DLSS. &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, for example, supports DLSS, but its performance without the feature turned on takes almost a 50 percent hit, running at about 35 frames per second at medium settings, according to Nvidia’s testing. That’s playable, but not particularly fluid, and it may be indicative of the kind of experience you might have when playing graphically intensive games that don’t support DLSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBdi9c"&gt;The performance charts that Nvidia shared with us only showed data on the RTX 3050 Ti’s performance, not the RTX 3050’s. Given that the RTX 3050 is a notch below the RTX 3050 Ti in terms of specs, you can probably expect performance to reflect that. Still, it should deliver good performance for the expected $799 starting price of laptops into which it will be built.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-BRc6ttkVX8MRwJsoLr2fzm9SY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505314/rtx3050tiperf.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the performance breakdown of the 3050 Ti in some games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qLFBom"&gt;It’s also important to remember that, like with all other RTX 30-series mobile graphics chips, OEMs are free to tweak the total graphics power (TGP) of each RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti in terms of wattage and clock speed to align with their design goals. The TGP range for these chips can be anywhere between 35W and 80W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIfXUq"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;it’s fair to expect less powerful variants in thinner laptops&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, thicker models often allow graphics cards to reach their highest possible power levels. As a result, you may want to keep that in mind when you’re shopping for a gaming laptop equipped with one of these new chips.&lt;/p&gt;
