    <title>Consumer protection agency investigating Venmo’s collection practices</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFJx8p"&gt;The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is investigating money transfer app Venmo over the way it handles collections, a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391721000018/pypl-20201231.htm"&gt;new regulatory filing shows&lt;/a&gt;. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmos-debt-collection-practices-probed-by-cfpb-11612537319"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the filing shows Venmo owner PayPal received a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB on January 21st, “related to Venmo’s unauthorized funds transfers and collections processes, and related matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4trN3"&gt;PayPal said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was working “productively with the CFPB to provide information, as requested, on our practices and processes.” The statement added that Venmo  “remains deeply committed to its compliance obligations and the company works closely with regulators around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Knn7lk"&gt;A Venmo user’s account may be referred to collections if it becomes overdrawn; while money transfers within the app usually occur immediately, sometimes the funds don’t leave the user’s bank account for more than 24 hours. So Venmo covers the amount of the payment in the interim. But if the user’s account doesn’t have the funds available when their bank processes the payment, Venmo tries to recoup the amount it covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbE5ZM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has covered &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-to-users-if-you-owe-us-money-were-coming-for-it-11553518800"&gt;Venmo’s collection practices&lt;/a&gt; in the past, reporting in 2019 that the company even pursued collections against users who may have been the victims of scammers. Last year, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/even-in-a-pandemic-venmo-tells-conned-customers-to-pay-up-11600939826"&gt;Venmo pursued collections&lt;/a&gt; at the same rate during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZp8SA"&gt;Venmo says its user agreement details its potential use of collections, and that it complies with all applicable laws when it pursues collection activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVMwQV"&gt;Venmo has seen an increase in users during the coronavirus pandemic, as more people used digital payment systems. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-profit-triples-as-pandemic-drives-continued-surge-in-online-payments-11612387131"&gt;PayPal reported&lt;/a&gt; net income of $1.57 billion for its fourth quarter, up from $507 million a year earlier. Venmo’s active accounts rose 32 percent in 2020 to nearly 70 million, and CEO Dan Schulman said in a &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403221-paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-ceo-dan-schulman-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;call with investors&lt;/a&gt; that the company expects Venmo’s revenue to approach $900 million in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7s1d7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="111E1V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxvY6h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3luwS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maeP8p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wR38Z6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="bOgRg2"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="UBHHFl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhwVTJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Myanmar orders internet providers to block Twitter and Instagram in the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Myanmar People Stage Protests As Internet Is Cut" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8up0EiPnlkwX-Hy_37vOhfQ7zgg=/0x1:2998x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68779776/1300658954.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rMAj48"&gt;Not long after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;blocked Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Myanmar has now ordered mobile networks and internet service providers to block Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram in the country as well. The southeast Asian country’s military &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/05/tech/myanmar-blocks-twitter-instagram/index.html"&gt;seized power in a coup&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, detaining its civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi along with other government officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCfuFb"&gt;Facebook users had &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-blocks-facebook-access-after-coup-11612436184?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;reportedly been using&lt;/a&gt; the social media platform to protest the coup, sharing photos of themselves giving the three-finger salute that’s become associated with resistance in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAaEKX"&gt;“All mobile operators, international gateways and internet service providers in Myanmar received a directive on 5 February 2021 from the Myanmar Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC) to, until further notice, block the social media platforms Twitter and Instagram,” Norwegian telecom company &lt;a href="https://www.telenor.com/directive-to-block-social-media-services-twitter-and-instagram-in-myanmar/"&gt;Telenor said in a statement late Friday.&lt;/a&gt; The company provides mobile services in Myanmar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAXbia"&gt;Myanmar’s Ministry of Information issued an ominous statement on Tuesday, a day after the military seized power, instructing people not to spread rumors on social media, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/asia/myanmar-military-coup-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html"&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt;. “Some media and public are spreading rumors on social media conducting gatherings to incite rowdiness and issuing statements which can cause unrest. We would like to urge the public not to carry out these acts and would like to notify the public to cooperate with the government in accordance with the existing laws,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RC1xa5"&gt;Rafael Frankel, Facebook’s director of public policy, APAC emerging countries, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “extremely concerned” by the shutdown orders, and urged authorities to unblock access immediately. “At this critical time, the people of Myanmar need access to important information and to be able to communicate with their loved ones,” Frankel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBQqPr"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson echoed that concern, saying in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the order “undermines the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard. The Open Internet is increasingly under threat around the world. We will continue to advocate to end destructive government-led shutdowns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ybBNW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 6th, 11:13AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statements from Facebook and Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the FDA is taking 22 days to look over J&amp;J’s data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, a vial and a medical syringe..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsWXUsbI2i5mr2yBPQ5OX1YfPCM=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68779704/1230084558.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZQpiQS"&gt;A billion years ago last summer, people were getting antsy about vaccines. They wanted things to move faster, maybe skip a few steps in clinical trials to speed things up. This was, at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21352706/covid-19-vaccine-steps-process-clinical-trials-speed-moderna"&gt;generally considered a bad idea&lt;/a&gt; that would result in less accurate data and cause people to lose trust in the vaccines. Now, exactly 1.589 trillion years later, recklessly speeding things up for speed’s sake remains a poor choice, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1357493589031452679"&gt;some people on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; like journalist Nate Silver, seem to think we should do it anyways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCwXOS"&gt;They take particular issue with the fact that while Johnson and Johnson submitted their data from their giant clinical trial this week, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267984/covid-vaccine-johnson-fda-one-dose-review"&gt;will take until February 26th to review the data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rGZjm"&gt;Three weeks can feel like an eternity during the pandemic, with hospitals crowded and deaths still climbing. It’s easy to be flip about the process and want things to Just. Go. Faster. But the 22 days is not that much longer than the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-announces-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;20 days the agency&lt;/a&gt; took to review data for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine or the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-announces-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;17 days for Moderna&lt;/a&gt;’s candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oaUzAb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMfiqT"&gt;Here’s what’s going to happen during those days. Researchers at the FDA will have to review the data from the 43,783 people who participated in the trial. This will entail looking at the cases across all study sites — here in the US, in Latin America and in South Africa, where a new coronavirus variant is dominant. The typical review process for a vaccine can take months. Instead, it will happen in a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ADXeE"&gt;If the process is anything like what the FDA planned for the earlier vaccine candidates, those weeks will be filled with a lot of late nights and workers doing everything that they can to reasonably speed things up. “Groups have been working in shifts, nights and weekends, looking in parallel at issues of clinical effectiveness and safety, and of levels of antibodies to confirm the way the vaccine is working.” the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3kDTC"&gt;Why do all that work? Right now, the information that we have about the vaccine comes from the company. That information is promising, and shows that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22257557/antivirus-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-results"&gt;probably be a good vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But there are reasons that the FDA doesn’t just take a company at its word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trKBd6"&gt;Let’s turn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraWrites/status/1357521813190893572"&gt;to noted scientific historian Billy Joel&lt;/a&gt;, and the “children of thalidomide.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NuYYmu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFTLKWw542g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NYtmhB"&gt;Thalidomide was a sedative that was given&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/health/thalidomide-survivors-usa.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article"&gt; to pregnant people&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960’s as a cure for morning sickness. It caused birth defects in thousands of children across the world. In the US, pregnant women were given the drug in clinical trials, but unlike other countries, it wasn’t approved for sale at the time, thanks to Frances Kelsey. Kelsey was a drug reviewer at the FDA who looked over data from the company trying to sell the drug and found it unconvincing. The incident &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101807/"&gt;led to new laws&lt;/a&gt; that let the FDA determine a drug’s safety &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbV9vH"&gt;Taking the time to review a vaccine during a pandemic might seem like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic — but it’s actually inspecting the lifeboats before you leave port. We have procedures and protocols for a reason. When we launch something big, like a rocket, engineers don’t just push a button and send it soaring. They go through detailed pre-flight checklists, making sure that every bit of a spaceship is sound. We’ve learned the hard way that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5175151"&gt;disregarding safety procedures can cost lives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yszDNe"&gt;Pushing out a third vaccine quickly might help save lives, yes. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21266591/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorize-emergency-experimental"&gt;only if people are willing to take it&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/why-arent-more-health-care-workers-getting-vaccinated.html"&gt;healthcare workers&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/why-arent-more-health-care-workers-getting-vaccinated.html"&gt;already hesitant&lt;/a&gt; to take the vaccine. They worry that the process is rushed. Rushing the process &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; isn’t likely to convince them — people who generally are not opposed to vaccines — that the process is safe and secure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJchl8"&gt;I get it. Waiting sucks. But when you’re injecting people with a new treatment and the trust of billions of people is on the line, sometimes it’s worth taking the time to double-check your work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97HnSe"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week. &lt;/p&gt;

But it’s still unclear whether they can prevent chronic COVID-19 symptoms. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

That statistic got misinterpreted as proof that the vaccine decreased &lt;em&gt;transmission&lt;/em&gt; of the virus. It might, but that hasn’t been proven yet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8qlS27"&gt;I had my espresso with foamed milk, even though coffee is disgusting to me now. I do not enjoy the taste. But I have a cup of coffee almost every morning. It’s like ritual, right? I enjoy the process of making it, and the warmth, and the caffeine. So I keep doing it, and I keep hoping that it will taste good to me at some point. I feel like I’m using my imagination when I eat, trying to use my memory of how things smell and taste to recreate the experience, because otherwise I would not want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV is coming to PlayStation 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CO7ZaqpAqYvQ1q_wR6ccg8QCKSc=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68779636/FFXIV_PUB_Announcement_Showcase_05.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Square-Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="neB2dq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PlayStation 5, developer &lt;a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/SQUARE-ENIX-ANNOUNCES-ENDWALKER-THE-LATEST-EXPANSION-FOR-FINAL-FANTASY"&gt;Square-Enix announced Friday&lt;/a&gt;. An open beta will start April 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2HEJj"&gt;A teaser trailer shows the game running in 4K resolution, and the company says it will have significantly improved frame rates and faster load times. If you’re registered in the PS4 version of the game, the new optimized version will be playable at no extra cost during the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DYtVt6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7ZEkdtTp8o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ayJi8"&gt;Final Fantasy XIV also will get a new expansion pack called &lt;em&gt;Endwalker:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6tF9PQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; features the climax of the Hydaelyn and Zodiark story, in which Warriors of Light will encounter an even greater calamity than ever before as they travel to the far reaches of Hydaelyn and even to the moon. In addition to bringing the long-running story arc that began with &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn &lt;/em&gt;to its conclusion, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; will mark a new beginning for the beloved MMO, setting the stage for new adventures that longtime fans and new players can enjoy together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="LDGIHC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-bkJ2ZoW6k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeK1Zq"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; was originally released in 2010, the game got so much backlash from players and critics that the its original director and producer left the project, and the developer &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/9/11/3318772/final-fantasy-xiv-to-suspend-billing-from-september-29th-until-the"&gt;shut down its servers in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. It relaunched in 2013 as &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IRfta"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are a few of this week’s best deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwgI1Y0Z0qltJ5jUQBV2inNa9mk=/0x0:1013x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68779474/destruction_all_stars_screenshots_14_disclaimer_ps5_en_15oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screengrab from Destruction All-Stars, a PS5 game you can get for free with a PS Plus subscription&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bSOn1T"&gt;How has the first week of February been for you? Good, I hope. We’re keeping it simple with the weekend deals post by providing a variety of the best discounts we’ve seen this week. Whether you just got a PS5 and want an affordable way to get a PS Plus membership, your home is in desperate need of better Wi-Fi coverage and speed, or you need an affordable Sonos speaker, you might find something you want below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8oQmf8"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qrPDZX"&gt;Save big on a PS Plus membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dYCcjE"&gt;This deal has been very popular with readers, and it’s easy to see why. A one-year subscription to PS Plus, Sony’s online service that allows multiplayer and complimentary titles each month, usually costs $60. But digital key seller Eneba is offering it to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers for $28 when they put in offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE28&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYxjqb"&gt;Sweetening the value, you can get two years of service (it’ll arrive in the form of two unique codes that you input in the PS Store) for just $56 when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEFEB &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CamqP"&gt;With PS Plus this month, you can get &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Control Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 as complimentary perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xvvq2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7LQoQ3"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Eero 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ULhFUiPZOoJ20AyiMlZrf4rkjW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284101/eero6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mUEkrt"&gt;Eero’s latest mesh Wi-Fi routers are discounted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zGymFF"&gt;Whether you’re looking to get a single Wi-Fi router or get set up with a variety bundle that’ll cast a wider blanket of Wi-Fi coverage over your house, there are some good deals happening on Amazon’s Eero products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NW6nv"&gt;If you want a whole-home solution, Eero’s 6 router (supporting Wi-Fi 6) comes bundled with two Eero 6 extenders for $223 (usually $279). But if you want to get started with a single Eero 6 router, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VM9ZDD?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ad859221eb81bb566d28812855d03192&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $103&lt;/a&gt; (down from $129). (Note that the Eero 6 router has two Ethernet ports, while the extenders are wireless only.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gqeJSP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ciX0mX"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sonos Play:1 images" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyy2rsEdOs2u1o8XSLN83tXsfvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2786320/sonosplay1-2040-8.1381709930.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OYPRfV"&gt;Snag a refurbished Sonos Play:1 for $99&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="teeTyz"&gt;Sonos is selling refurbished Play:1 Wi-Fi speakers for $99 at its site. This is a solid investment if you want something affordable to build out your collection of Sonos speakers. It’s a little long in the tooth, having originally released in 2013, but it’s still supported by Sonos’ S2 platform and mobile app. These speakers should look and operate as new, and they come with a one-year warranty through Sonos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ShTtJe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10322142"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0VgxHU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Miami mayor says Elon Musk will tunnel under the city for just $30 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHo0o3ZmJAlndP_hbMxFV0rY34E=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68778193/Boring_tunnel__2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Boring Company&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FpUyES"&gt;Elon Musk told Miami’s mayor Friday that The Boring Company could dig a two-mile tunnel under the city for as little as $30 million — a fraction of the $1 billion price tag once &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article249037895.html"&gt;quoted by local transit officials&lt;/a&gt;. Musk also told the Mayor that The Boring Company could complete the job in six months, versus the original four year estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AujKa6"&gt;Mayor Francis Suarez shared these details about his “wonderful call” with Musk in a video posted to Twitter. “He’s focused on trying to deliver a project that will have the maximum utility for our residents for the least amount of money,” Suarez said. “The order of magnitude in terms of savings is significant.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q4TKdH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just had my call w/ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; regarding &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boringcompany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@boringcompany&lt;/a&gt; tunnels coming to MIA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DETAILS BELOW   &lt;a href="https://t.co/NsJFYcvGeQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NsJFYcvGeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mayor Francis Suarez (@FrancisSuarez) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1357796329263669258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4YVrEd"&gt;Musk first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1351091106805645312"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about wanting to tunnel under Miami on January 18th. “Cars &amp;amp; trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases &amp;amp; particulate, but @boringcompany road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic &amp;amp; be an example to the world,” he wrote. Musk said in the tweet that he had already spoken to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis about the idea. “If Governor &amp;amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UebnY2"&gt;Suarez said Friday that he will speak to DeSantis and the mayor of Miami-Dade county. “I think we have a unique opportunity to create a signature project not just for Miami, but for the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9iw3C"&gt;Tunneling under Miami is not easy because the city is built on limestone, which is spongey. That hurdle is one reason for the sky-high price tag quoted in 2018. It also helped drive up the price of a tunnel under the Port of Miami, which was less than a mile but &lt;a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/02/05/miami-mayor-francis-suarez-elon-musk-tunnel-transit/"&gt;still cost around $700 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yqm6S0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Miami is built on limestone, which would be hard to tunnel through&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLzMh4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article249037895.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday that the limestone bedrock and the impact of rising sea levels were among the talking points for the call, though it’s unclear to what extent these items were discussed. Musk has previously talked about digging tunnels &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1305901516239273986"&gt;as deep underground as skyscrapers are tall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHwxRO"&gt;Musk started The Boring Company in 2016, and has started a handful of projects around the country in the years since. The purpose and scope of the tunnels has changed a bit over that time. These days, the company is trying to make a transportation service that uses Teslas traveling through the tunnels. The first commercial service is nearing completion underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, though The Boring Company recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;a massive city-wide expansion that would service the Strip and the airport&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/infrastructure/press-release/21208883/san-bernardino-county-transportation-authority-sbcta-sbcta-board-to-begin-negotiating-with-the-boring-company-on-the-ontario-loop-project"&gt;in negotiations for a tunnel in San Bernardino County, California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHeXRG"&gt;Other attempts have not gone so well, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics"&gt;a failed project in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/28/elon-musk-underground-tunnel-los-angeles-lawsuit"&gt;a canceled tunnel in West Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit stopped rogue r/WallStreetBets mods from taking over the community</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbqxwpYbBdGWcLC3CFMgG9v6jRw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68778141/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m1RETn"&gt;Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets has grown significantly due to the community’s role in driving up the stock prices of companies like GameStop, AMC, and Nokia, and the whole saga has garnered so much attention that there are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;many movies and a TV show in the works&lt;/a&gt;. But that increased attention has also put strain on the r/WallStreetBets community itself, forcing Reddit to step in to help sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCLIB0"&gt;The trouble started Wednesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/technology/wallstreetbets-gamestop-hollywood.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as some r/WallStreetBets moderators talked with each other about trying to get a movie deal. On Thursday morning, “the WallStreetBets moderators who were considering the film deal began booting out other moderators who had questioned them for secretly trying to profit from the forum’s success,” reports &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcvluc/an_update_on_the_wsb_coup_d%C3%A9tat/"&gt;highly upvoted r/WallStreetBets post&lt;/a&gt; called the situation “a coup,” saying the moderators the community “know and love” were being tossed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNKvHp"&gt;At some point, Reddit stepped in to stop the takeover, and the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it had removed some r/WallStreetBets mods. The company says &lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines-for-healthy-communities"&gt;they violated rule five of its moderator guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mYZyWv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable and Active Teams of Moderators:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBIYIX"&gt;Healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xDPirS"&gt;The company wouldn’t share how many mods were removed.  As of this writing, there are 28 mods listed on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/moderators"&gt;r/WallStreetBets mods page&lt;/a&gt;, and “in recent weeks there have been a few dozen,” according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhftlg"&gt;Reddit said it had to take action due to the instability the situation created for the community, according to a message sent to the r/WallStreetBets mods by Reddit that was &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-steps-in-wallstreetbets-subreddit-moderator-bans/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We understand many will be upset with our decisions today, however it was clear to us an intervention was necessary for the continued health of the r/wallstreetbets community,” part of the message read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X54uWP"&gt;The mods removed by Reddit can’t be immediately reinstated as moderators of r/WallStreetBets, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The mods removed by the bad actors &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be reinstated as mods on r/WallStreetBets, but at the discretion of the current mod team. It’s unclear which of the removed mods may return, or which have been invited to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7wNGh"&gt;Last week, Discord also had to step in to help moderate a WallStreetBets community. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;banned the original r/WallStreetBets server&lt;/a&gt; due to “hateful and discriminatory content” and has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254339/discord-r-wallstreetbets-server-help-moderation-ban"&gt;helping the mods of the new one&lt;/a&gt; with moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos FCC filing hints it’s coming for the UE Boom and other small Bluetooth speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gC6MHEWI_TRACI-0nQrmDDS6Tnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777896/dseifert_190826_3622_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6CMqrq"&gt;Sonos is preparing for the release of a new product that, according to FCC documentation, is likely to be the company’s second portable speaker with a rechargeable battery. The unannounced device, &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM027"&gt;listed at the FCC as model number S27&lt;/a&gt;, is shown in testing diagrams to have a wireless charging dock and offer both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) wireless technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PESOW0-rZqPH33lx7waZNR32TnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22285206/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_4.57.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM027/Label/10-1-S27-FCC-ISED-Label-format-Location-12-14-2020-5097436" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FCC diagrams reveal a wireless charging dock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="41y6tA"&gt;The mandatory FCC label reveals that this new product uses less power than existing Sonos speakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality"&gt;the Sonos Move&lt;/a&gt;, lending more credence to a smaller overall size. The circular label design, and the fact that Sonos says the label is visible on the bottom surface of the product hints that this Sonos speaker could feature a cylindrical design similar to Bluetooth speaker mainstays like the UE Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YDF9ooDzVL5Og2YZqCD9TcUb2GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22285059/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_1.03.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM027/Label/10-1-S27-FCC-ISED-Label-format-Location-12-14-2020-5097436" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PSj6Wh"&gt;The current Sonos Move’s size and weight help it to put out strong sound, but they also make it a less practical speaker for taking on the go. At a hefty 6.6 pounds, it’s something you’d bring from inside out to your porch, maybe, but Sonos still lacks a speaker portable enough for tossing into a bag and traveling with. S27 might just be the answer for that. The original Move, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20799366/sonos-bluetooth-portable-speaker-model-s17"&gt;leaked soon after its own FCC filing&lt;/a&gt;, is model number S17. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current Sonos Move is far larger than many portable Bluetooth speakers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9A8C5W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10322870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSoeGq"&gt;This would also be the first speaker from Sonos to include Wi-Fi 5; the Move supports Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n). Bluetooth would come into play more often when using the speaker outside somewhere, but improved Wi-Fi could help performance when playing it around the home as part of Sonos’ multi-room systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZAid2"&gt;Other products that Sonos is rumored to be actively developing include a pair of premium headphones. But a line in one of the FCC documents seems to rule out that we’re looking at those. “For satisfying FCC RF exposure compliance requirements, the device must be used with a separation distance of at least 20 cm from all persons,” it says. So all signs — especially that wireless charger — point to a small, rechargeable device. As much as I’d love to see a Sonos shower head speaker or something a little unconventional, I’m banking on a Move Mini. And hopefully for a price significantly lower than the $400 Move. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden’s executive order on refugees matters a lot for climate migration </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaEjkE"&gt;Joe Biden’s administration is crafting a report that will include proposals for how the US might respond to global migration due to climate change. Biden commissioned the report as part of a broader &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/04/executive-order-on-rebuilding-and-enhancing-programs-to-resettle-refugees-and-planning-for-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-migration/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; he signed yesterday aimed at overhauling the US refugee resettlement program, which was gutted under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHgk3U"&gt;“I’ve worked on this very intersection of issues for over a decade, and I never thought that this would be a part of any American president’s priorities, especially within the first 30 days of their administration,” says Kayly Ober, climate displacement manager at the humanitarian organization Refugees International. “So I am delighted and surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2sjxz2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A game-changer for people who’ve fled their homes because of climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0I6Y1Z"&gt;If Biden’s report, due in 179 days, leads to an actual pathway to resettlement in the US, it could be a game-changer for people who’ve fled their homes because of climate change. There are currently no policies that allow someone who’s been displaced by climate-related disasters to apply for a visa, green card, or refugee protections in the US. It’s a gap that’s, for the most part, missing globally, too. International institutions literally don’t even have the words to tackle the issue: there’s still a debate over whether to consider displaced people “migrants” or “refugees” since the terminology could affect what legal protections a person is entitled to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbHhXP"&gt;Meanwhile, an average of &lt;a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/publications/seizing-the-momentum-displacement-on-the-global-climate-change-agenda"&gt;21.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; are pushed from their homes each year because of climate-related hazards. That includes people who’ve survived disasters like storms and floods that have grown more intense as the planet heats up. For comparison, that’s almost &lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/new-framework-us-leadership-climate-migration"&gt;nine times&lt;/a&gt; as many people as those who apply for political asylum because of the fear of persecution in their home country. What’s more, 21.5 million people is likely an underestimate of how many people climate change is actually pushing to the brink. That figure &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; include people on the move because of the slower-moving consequences of climate change like drought and rising sea levels. The number of people seeking new homes as global temperatures rise is only expected to grow. So governments and international organizations need to start acting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vl5kBX"&gt;The US has a big role to play on the global stage when it comes to figuring out how to grapple with climate-driven migration. For one, the US has contributed the most to the climate crisis since it’s emitted &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions"&gt;more greenhouse gases historically&lt;/a&gt; than any other country. That aside, the US has played a leading role in refugee resettlement in the past. For decades until the Trump administration, it accepted &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/19/canada-now-leads-the-world-in-refugee-resettlement-surpassing-the-u-s/"&gt;more refugees every year than any other country&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMNzPv"&gt;“If the US plants a flag that says that they’re willing to figure out a way to offer refugee-like status to people who are displaced by climate change, it will allow other countries to take up their fair share of that burden as well,” says Ober.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aljzTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This executive order is still just a starting point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qSTdmb"&gt;The executive order signed yesterday is still just a starting point. While Biden has signaled that climate change and immigration will be key priorities for his administration, there need to be real policies in place to impart the kinds of changes he talks about. Sweeping changes to America’s immigration and refugee resettlement will require legislation, as will a plan to wean the US off fossil fuels. The US also needs to stop polluting so much in the first place if it wants to keep climate change from driving displacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv1x5v"&gt;“With this climate and migration report, let’s make sure it’s not some sort of risk scenario and planning exercise,” says Ober. “Let’s make sure this is about actually offering a solution, especially for those who are at risk, who are already displaced.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A German man is keeping $60 million in bitcoin from police by never revealing his password</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDhPhON_vphR3OBILvcf5GpHaPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68777659/mdoying_180308_2373_0092still.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9Cou2"&gt;The wonderful thing about bitcoin is many of its apparent benefits, like the ability to be anonymously owned and securely transferred, are also the things that often create situations like this: police in Germany have seized more than €50 million ($60 million) in bitcoin, but they can’t access any of it because, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-germany-password/police-seize-60-million-of-bitcoin-now-wheres-the-password-idUSKBN2A511T"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the person they took it from won’t tell them his password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXgUlQ"&gt;The man in question was sentenced and has served his time in jail for covertly installing bitcoin mining software on people’s computers, but throughout the entire process, he never shared a peep about how German authorities should get in. “We asked him but he didn’t say” is the explanation &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; was offered by a prosecutor. It presents a big, and probably obvious, question: can you really seize something, particularly money, that you can’t access or use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yb0EtT"&gt;The even more glaring issue is how often passwords, PINs, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/"&gt;and their collective absence&lt;/a&gt; pop up in stories about bitcoin, illegal or otherwise. There was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;a recent story&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; about a programmer with his own bitcoin fortune locked away in a secure hard drive that revealed an amazing statistic: around 20 percent of bitcoin in existence today (totaling around $140 billion) are completely lost or locked up in wallets with lost passwords, meaning they’re completely inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FF9y4t"&gt;So maybe this German bitcoin enthusiast is sticking it to the people who had him locked up, or maybe he’s simply forgotten his password. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that prosecutors have “ensured the man cannot access [his] largesse” but if they can’t access it either, I think it’s safe to say that pile of lost bitcoin just got a bit larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydvpiY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3S1qe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0CHiL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
