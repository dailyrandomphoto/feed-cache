    <title>Google Pixel 6 appears to fall short of expected 30W charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNfsde9ODBND2xI1T3rhqcMqQww=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105137/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQ0Ucz"&gt;When Google released the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it boasted about the devices’ fast-charging capabilities. Plugging a Pixel 6 series device into its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger"&gt;$25 30W Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt; — which isn’t even included in the box — is supposed to take full advantage of the phone’s fast charging speed, juicing it up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. We all can agree that this is an impressive spec, but unfortunately, it may not be totally realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz4HxR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put the Pixel 6’s fast charging speed to the test, and its findings suggest that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570"&gt;Google’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; is misleading. After trying out the 30W charger with the Pixel 6, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found that the Pixel 6 doesn’t fully harness the power of the charger — instead, it only hits a maximum charging speed of just 22W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R5zDeA"&gt;
&lt;div class="infogram-embed" data-id="_/XhxOon5FbW8f2n44upZj" data-type="interactive" data-title="Google Pixel 6 Pro Fast Charging Test"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&amp;&amp;window[t].initialized)window[t].process&amp;&amp;window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zeJxCm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes that the charger took about 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery with its Adaptive Charging and Adaptive Battery settings switched off. Google is right; the device takes about 31 minutes for a 50 percent charge, however, filling up that final 50 percent takes much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Q6Vy"&gt;The phone’s charging speed appears to dip all the way to 12W at 75 percent, and then 2.5W when the battery gets close to full, taking a whole hour to fill up the final 15 percent. While it’s normal for charging speeds to taper off over time to prevent damage to the battery and stave off high temperatures, dropping down to a mere 2.5W is still unusual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gqelqf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The charger took a total of 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNYf1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; even compared the charging speeds of the 30W Fast Charger with the 18W Power Delivery unit that Google included with older Pixels. It found that the 30W charger barely offers any improvement in terms of speed, as it takes 121 minutes to charge the Pixel 6 Pro with the 18W charger — only 10 minutes slower than the 30W Fast Charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyEKEy"&gt;This corroborates what we noticed during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;hands-on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review&lt;/a&gt;. We pointed out that while both support fast charging, neither seemed to fuel up that fast. Also in line with &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;’s findings, we noted that Google throttles the charging speed after reaching 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcSQMf"&gt;Google doesn’t explicitly say that the Pixel 6 has a charging rate of 30W; it just says that both phones support “up to 50 percent charge in 30 minutes with Google 30W USB-C Charger with USB-PD 3.0 (PPS)” on its spec sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYAfGD"&gt;But it still doesn’t make sense that Google would promote the Fast Charger if the Pixel 6 can’t take full advantage of it. Not to mention that Google is encouraging users to buy the charger under the guise that it really does provide lightning-fast charging rates — is 10 minutes really worth an extra $25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84waxz"&gt;Google is also set to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;a second-gen $79 Google Pixel Stand fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the near future. The &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;“superfast wireless charger” is listed as&lt;/a&gt; providing charging speeds of up to 23W “for compatible Pixel phones,” which is closer to the 22W charging rate that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro tops out at. It remains unclear why Google would give more realistic expectations for the upcoming wireless charger, and not for the 30W Fast Charger. We reached out to Google with a request for comment on the situation and didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack in the Box suing crypto exchange FTX, says it ‘brazenly’ copied its Jack mascot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azq-zc8UuSV_K7m9z7qUGLR79w0=/184x0:903x479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105071/jack_mascots.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jack in the Box is suing a crypto exchange it says copied its longtime mascot. Left is Moon Man, right is Jack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUuzEN"&gt;Restaurant chain Jack in the Box says it is suing cryptocurrency exchange FTX because it “brazenly and illegally copied or derived its ‘Moon Man’ mascot” from its established Jack mascot, and is doing damage to the Jack in the Box brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viRPw6"&gt;In a lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of California this week, Jack in the Box claims that FTX’s Moon Man character, aka Lou Nar, “has a spherical white head also affixed to a talking human actor, with blue-dotted eyes, a nose, and a smile,” which is “strikingly similar to Jack. Both change their facial expressions and clothing throughout ads and appearances,” the suit maintains. Moon Man, however, is a “far inferior version” of Jack, the restaurant chain argues, and is  “tarnishing Jack’s reputation to consumers, and/or blurring consumers’ association of FTX’s Moon Man with Jack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOeH5h"&gt;The company pointed to tweets about ads featuring Moon Man that were aired during a Major League Baseball game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CQVxmw"&gt;...viewers of that baseball game shared their reactions on Twitter as to who the “big head” might be, with one user posting a picture of Jack, stating that the Moon Man is the “Jack in the Box mascot.” Other members of the public have made statements such as “Oh look, it’s Walmart Jack in the Box!”, “Is it a dirty jack in the box thing?”, and “Jack in the Box’s drugged up cousin”, among others, which all demonstrate that viewers were associating the Moon Man with Jack. One Twitter user even tweeted a public post directly to FTX stating, “Hey, @FTX_Official, your mascot doesn’t look like the moon. He looks like Jack-In-The-Box with skin cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j2wTln"&gt;Jack in the Box served FTX with a cease-and-desist letter on October 15th, according to the lawsuit, notifying the crypto exchange that it was “infringing on JITB’s intellectual property and diluting its trademarks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Zjv90"&gt;In response, FTX said it would continue to use Moon Man in advertising, the lawsuit claims, saying that “Jack in the Box has only narrow protection limited to the behatted ping pong-headed clown who exploded out of a box to sell burgers.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6t2uUHzEjwV9e0A_eLl5Lf4NK7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22991323/jack_moon_man_2.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Moon Man (left) and Jack (right). &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JvFTda"&gt;Jack in the Box says the Jack mascot was first released in 1951, and it’s gone through a few iterations since. At first Jack was a “clown-like spherical head that sat atop drive-thru boxes to ease customers into the then-novel concept of drive-thru restaurants,” according to the suit, then in 1970 it became more clown-like, with green hair and a large rainbow collar added. The company “reimagined” the mascot in 1995, into the current version: a “humorous no-nonsense businessman”  who “appears like a typical adult human male, with the exception of his large, spherical white head, blue dot eyes, nose, and curvy smile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8blFM"&gt;The suit was first reported by legal news site &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/1438006/jack-in-the-box-says-crypto-exchange-ripped-off-its-mascot?copied=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Jack in the Box nor FTX replied to requests for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hzpOQ"&gt;Jack in the Box says FTX has infringed on its copyright and diluted its trademark, and is seeking unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot swapped a live show for a massive music video at Worlds 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KMRUcaWN5Nif_mRpQI_ohGKsOs=/0x2:8033x5357/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104983/CYW_WorldsOC_Set_015.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9008O"&gt;Every year, one of the highlights of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;World Championship is the opening ceremonies. It’s been a regular chance for developer Riot to create a real-world spectacle ahead of the big game. In the past that’s meant everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;holographic musical performances&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;an appearance from an augmented reality K-pop group&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, though, things went in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV6afJ"&gt;Without an audience in attendance due to COVID-19 restrictions, Riot instead went with a pre-produced series of music videos that featured gigantic real-world sets spliced with moments from the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Arcane &lt;/em&gt;animated series. It may not have been a live performance, but it was still impressive. “This is really what feature films do, what Marvel does,” says Matt Kauth, head of production at London Alley Entertainment, which worked with Riot on the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyxJhq"&gt;What premiered before Worlds’ championship match was essentially a 13-minute-long short film that combined animation, music videos, and physical sets. It featured a handful of performances from the likes of Imagine Dragons and Bea Miller, interspersed with animated vignettes from &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts on Netflix this evening. The idea of mixing live-action and CG isn’t exactly new, but part of what makes the Worlds event work so well is the sprawling real-world sets designed to look like Zaun and Piltover, two iconic cities from &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; (which are featured prominently in the Netflix show).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54IkKp1SE5jQb4vgTiCY1mQ1kEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989614/CYW_WorldsOC_BTS_031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Riot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZFlsQ"&gt;“These are the biggest sets that we’ve ever done, and it’s probably not even close,” says Kauth, whose studio has worked on music videos for the likes of Lil Nas X and The Weeknd. “We shot this whole piece over three days in Los Angeles and three days in Birmingham, UK. It is also the busiest it has ever been in the production landscape right now. Both because we’re coming out of the other side of covid, but also because all of the streaming that’s happening. It’s never been busier, and crews are very hard to come by. The LA shoot, we were literally taking construction members rolling off of TV shows. And adding new crew members every single day in order to meet this time frame.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9zgMP"&gt;Music videos were always part of the plan. But initially Riot had hoped to incorporate a live element as well. That changed when the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22649691/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-europe"&gt;forced to move the event from Shenzhen, China to Reykjavík, Iceland&lt;/a&gt; due to covid concerns. “We actually always intended for there to be this integration of music videos and more cinematic performances,” says Nick Troop, executive producer of the event for Riot. “Even when Worlds was still situated in Shenzhen, we were going to shoot these videos this way. This was the general plan. And part of the magic of the stadium show was going to be to build this interplay between the live show and the stuff that was pre-recorded, and use that to elevate what was happening in-stadium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0K8pHF"&gt;The focus on physical sets is a contrast to past Worlds, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;new technologies like mixed reality were on full display&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the reason for the choice was practical. With a short timeline to finish the production, the physical sets would put less strain on the various VFX teams that worked on it. If the videos had been shot with a green screen, for instance, it would’ve taken much longer to finish because artists would’ve had to design the backdrops virtually from scratch. “Our goal was to make sure that we were capturing as much in-camera as possible, so that when we handed the baton off to the VFX departments, they had enough to work with,” explains Kauth. (Even still, five different studios and 230 people worked on wrapping the post-production effects.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03XLnCzxuB-LRHthD2kgr4B-J3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989619/CYW_WorldsOC_BTS_094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Riot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WJCOLz"&gt;But the IRL sets were also chosen because Riot thought it would help differentiate the opening ceremonies from the many other virtual performances that have been happening of late, particularly during the pandemic. Plus, it just looked cool. “You can feel when it’s real,” says Troop. “You live in a rendered world for the most part when you interact with &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Here is one of a handful of opportunities to bring it to life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tigilh"&gt;It’s typical for large-scale movie productions, like those from Marvel, to utilize both large sets and multiple effects studio partners. But Kauth says it’s rare for shorter form projects like this. Not only did it help make the opening ceremonies look impressive, he says, but having so many people working on it also helped make it a more sustainable production where teams were able to largely avoid crunch. “It’s a film and TV approach to hit the deadline and not burn a single company into the ground,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr6KvA"&gt;As impressive as the 2021 ceremony was, there is definitely something missing without an in-person audience. It’s hard for the team to know if viewers are into it without the roar of a crowd inside of a stadium. In lieu of that this year, they’ll be looking elsewhere for that initial rush of feedback. “I’ll be curious for sure,” says Troop. “I’ll be keeping an eye on Twitter and Twitch chat.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware X17 review: pretty pixels for a pretty penny</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It delivers the 4K future I’ve been waiting for, but it came at a weird time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="43sxgT"&gt;Alienware did it. Its latest 17.3-inch X17 gaming laptop can actually deliver an enjoyable 4K gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjZa3F"&gt;The last time I checked in on how laptops were faring with 4K gaming in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976363/razer-blade-pro-17-4k-120hz-display-gaming-laptop-review-specs-features-price"&gt;things weren’t looking so hot&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia’s last-gen RTX 20-series mobile chips couldn’t work hard enough to smoothly run demanding games at 4K without several compromises to visual fidelity. Fortunately, things have changed for the better this year with the RTX 3080 — specifically, for the X17’s high-powered 16GB VRAM variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFnDQt"&gt;The X17’s 3080 has a maximum graphics power level of 165W and a boost clock speed of 1,545MHz. That’s really powerful for a mobile GPU and close to the highest amount of power that Nvidia allows for its mobile graphics chips. It’s certainly the most graphically capable laptop that I’ve tested yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nI5Bzi"&gt;I’ll get to the performance numbers in a sec, but it’s important to note near the top that this is one of Alienware’s best gaming laptops yet, and not only because it &lt;em&gt;whips &lt;/em&gt;at gaming. Its X-series design is new for 2021, resulting in a slimmer and sleeker look that balances form and function better than most other models that have similar power levels without foregoing ports (more on that later). For gaming and other intensive tasks, its cooling system is efficient, keeping this 17.3-inch 4K beast both cool and surprisingly quiet. And even when you’re doing other stuff, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22333684/alienware-m15-m17-gaming-laptops-cherry-mx-ultra-low-mechanical-keyboard-switches-price"&gt;clicky Cherry ultra-low-profile mechanical switches&lt;/a&gt; are fun to type on. It’s a heavy laptop that you probably won’t want to lug around to many places, but functionally, the X17 is almost as good for work as it is for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6axkpc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10847819"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Cd0q4E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847747"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qxMGMl"&gt;Despite these glowing remarks, if you were to ask me if you should buy this specific gaming laptop, I would advise against it unless you’re dead-set on getting a powerful 17.3-inch gaming laptop. It’s a tough sell &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeX17Review110521&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Falienware-x17-r1-laptop%3F%7Eck%3Dmn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at its $3,680 asking price&lt;/a&gt;, as configured. (I will note that this similar &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fmsigs7611078.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeX17Review110521"&gt;MSI GS76 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; configuration costs hundreds more than the X17, but has twice the amount of RAM. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-17%2FRZ09-0406CE63-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeX17Review110521"&gt;Razer’s latest Blade 17&lt;/a&gt; costs $3,699 and has a 4K/120Hz touchscreen and a more capable processor, but has less storage, as configured, and its GPU isn’t as powerful.) Also, since I received this unit for review, Alienware has paused on accepting new orders because it needs to catch up with its supply chain backlog. A spokesperson said Alienware intends to offer it for sale again at some point in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJ32t"&gt;To test X17’s gaming performance, I ran some titles that have proven to be demanding at their highest graphical settings, starting with &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;. At native 4K without Nvidia’s deep-learning supersampling (DLSS) tech that tends to give games a noticeable boost in frame rate (by lowering the render resolution and using AI to clean up the image), it ran at 46 frames per second. With DLSS set to auto and no other settings adjusted, the frame rate in 4K went up to 60 frames per second. Personally, I always lean on DLSS as much as any game will allow me to for those few extra free frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="260muE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s benchmark registered an average of 55 frames per second without ray tracing. When I turned on ray tracing, DLSS dropped it slightly to 49 frames per second. On the other hand, DLSS running without the taxing ray tracing bumped it up to 64 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design ID is similar to the M-series, but the X17 looks more elegant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playing games like Deathloop on its max graphical settings in 4K is a joy on the X17.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hKDTmD"&gt;The X17 delivered similarly promising results with &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;. Both averaged around 55 to 70 frames per second with every possible setting switched to their highest option. With each game’s respective ray tracing settings on, performance was closer to around 50 frames per second, which is still phenomenal at this resolution. The best performing of the bunch at 4K was &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; without ray tracing, which sometimes sailed over 100 frames per second in smaller corridors, dropping to a steady 75 frames per second during frantic fights in larger environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3Ou3O"&gt;These are all very playable frame rates, whether you decide to go the ray tracing route or take advantage of DLSS in games that support it. Also, since the X17 can run these demanding AAA games at 4K/60 without much of a struggle, many other games that aren’t as demanding should be able to take full advantage of its 120Hz refresh rate display in native 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNUOG4"&gt;I won’t lie: I wasn’t expecting this kind of reliable performance with this system, let alone with any other kind of thin-ish gaming laptop. I’ve seen similar specs in action before in other models, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;I was less than impressed&lt;/a&gt;. While Alienware isn’t the first to use a 4K 120Hz display in a gaming laptop, or the aforementioned RTX 3080, it earns credit for cramming it all in a slim chassis that’s much more powerful, yet somehow quieter and cooler than some of the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-N1nZGJQYbKfLTSL2IQuUofvSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859889/akrales_210916_4757_0183.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The optional Cherry MX ultra-low profile mechanical switches are a worthy addition, since you’re already spending a ton of this laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6UZSj"&gt;Digging more into what the X17 can do with its powerful components, its performance in Adobe Premiere Pro is as impressive as you might expect. During our test where we see how long it takes to churn out a 5-minute, 33-second 4K video, the X17 took three minutes, 22 seconds to get through the export process. For a more intensive benchmark, the PugetBench for Premiere Pro &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=60260"&gt;scored competitively&lt;/a&gt; with similarly specced gaming desktops, which is both to be expected (and that price) and impressive. Funnily enough, Apple’s M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros each handily beat Alienware’s score, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;as we noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;. Those outliers aside, you’ll be hard-pressed to find this kind of performance in many other gaming laptops out right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkFwAZ"&gt;It goes without saying, then, that the X17 didn’t see my usual workload as much of an obstacle. I typically run about 20 tabs in Microsoft Edge, along with Spotify, Slack, and Affinity Photo, and the X17 didn’t miss a beat. I realized once that I accidentally had around 40 tabs open in minimized Edge windows, but not even that caused a noticeable hitch or slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbVdW6"&gt;The Windows Hello IR webcam here is good for logging in hands-free, but if you anticipate doing lots of video calls, the image quality is mediocre. The video feed looks passable if you’re in good light, but it proved unable to compensate for being rear-lit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eam59n_1mC3WS6B0sXQgkqQWf5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859888/akrales_210916_4757_0159.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows Hello IR webcam is good at logging you in, but its 720p 1MP sensor doesn’t yield great results for video chats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAN8Yl"&gt;Battery life doesn’t seem to have been a high priority for Alienware since the X17 is primarily aimed at fast desktop-class 4K gaming performance while plugged in. But it’s not the worst we’ve seen, averaging almost four hours of mixed use with the workload that I mentioned above. It’d be tough for me to find a justification for lugging this heavy laptop away from its charger, though. It weighs about seven pounds, and its 330W charger is almost the size and weight of a literal brick. The good news about the power supply is that it recharges the X17 quickly, taking just over an hour to go from about 10 percent to full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYSEO"&gt;This X-series chassis is new for 2021, as I mentioned before, and it’s generally a positive evolution of the bulkier M-series design. It has the company’s signature Alienware alien logo as its power button, and its rear, where you’ll now find nearly all of the ports instead of just some of them, looks like the exhaust of a futuristic spaceship. That’s where most of the hot air from the X17’s quad-fan cooling system and the plentiful copper heatsinks is dispelled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4ewzx1cKtAnNKnO-MJoQb-7XW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859883/akrales_210916_4757_0107.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylish, honeycomb-patterned rear exhaust design derived from the M-series still looks pretty cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHVxZb"&gt;In slimming down, Alienware didn’t make any major omissions in terms of ports. There are two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports with PD charging (5V/3A), one of which is Thunderbolt 4. You also have two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a 2.5-gigabit Ethernet port, an HDMI 2.1 port, a micro SD slot, and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. On the right side, there’s a lone headphone jack, and on the left, there’s a plug for the power cable. Just in case you were curious, the X-series gaming laptops, along with the M15 R5 and R6 models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/1/22464110/dell-alienware-graphics-amp-egpu-discontinued"&gt;don’t have Alienware’s graphics amplifier port&lt;/a&gt;, though it should support Thunderbolt GPU enclosures — not that this X17 needs any help in the graphics department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtchZs"&gt;The two-toned body design is a small but appreciated tweak, as are a few areas around the laptop where Alienware softened its look. It rounded off the laptop’s corners that were previously angular and, frankly, leaning a little too hard into the “alien” aesthetic. Though if you didn’t like the look before, your feelings may not be changed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dIC-4K_ITX2CrAE-uzIuinM9jc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859882/akrales_210916_4757_0086.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some may dislike that you’ll have to reach to the back of the X17 to reach its ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2X11-GCd2-Tn58dOZK55dsb2Gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859884/akrales_210916_4757_0118.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware gets credit for cramming a lot of power into the thin section of its chassis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkn6lR"&gt;You can usually count on gaming laptops to bring the power, a nice display, and maybe ports, too, but you can’t always depend on getting a good keyboard to go with it. This version of the X17 includes the ultra-low-profile Cherry mechanical key switches that were first introduced on the M-series, and they feel fantastic to type on. They’re quiet for mechanical keys, but they have a much more satisfying “thock” feel than membrane laptop keyboards. I’m impressed by how many powerful components Alienware was able to cram into the thinnest section of its chassis, which is just under 16mm thick (its rear section shoots up to 22mm), with room to spare for a mechanical keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQHqdc"&gt;The key layout is intuitive, though some may be upset that the numpad is missing. I did encounter the occasional issue with the keyboard’s responsiveness. Sometimes, my first key press wouldn’t register, so I’d need to try again. It didn’t feel like an n-key rollover issue — just some strange latency with accepting the first input here and there. There were other times when the keyboard would suddenly stop accepting any input whatsoever, requiring a restart. It felt like the kind of thing that can be addressed with a patch, but it’s not an encouraging sign that I’m experiencing it several months after this laptop became available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bq_X68SxV4zmLJkACs2XsgVr_dQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859880/akrales_210915_4757_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would rather have a bigger trackpad than one that lights up, but it’d be better to have both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cc9u7TsaoJ1oooTTla8h_mxhNpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859890/akrales_210916_4757_0184.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X17 lacks the angular edges found on the M-series, giving it a more toned-down look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VUWOaJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9JBTai"&gt;One weird inclusion with the RTX 3080 is the light-up trackpad that illuminates when you touch it, though the light goes out after a few seconds of inactivity. It’s just for show, but nevertheless, it’s a basic trackpad with support for Windows Precision drivers and gesture customization in Windows. I’d like to see Alienware follow in Razer and MSI’s footsteps and implement bigger trackpads instead of superfluous features like trackpad backlighting. This current one is a little too small, almost seeming to signal that you should use a dedicated mouse instead, which is usually my advice with most gaming laptops anyway. Speaking of accessories, grab a gaming headset, as the built-in speakers aren’t anything special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpIFAI"&gt;Earlier this year, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;heralded the arrival of QHD screens&lt;/a&gt; as “the best thing to happen to gaming laptops” because I felt a future where 4K gaming on a laptop was commonplace still seemed far off. I was excited because lowering the resolution from 4K to 1440p would mean that games would still look very good, yet more reasonably priced components would be able to run them, thus driving down the total cost of laptops. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;We now have a growing amount of powerful, fully featured QHD options&lt;/a&gt; that are cheaper than 4K laptops and well worth the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPKbrm"&gt;That leaves the Alienware X17 in a tough spot. On one hand, there’s nothing like gaming on a big 17.3-inch screen. The slightly smaller 16-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;16:10 aspect ratio QHD screens&lt;/a&gt; that we’re thankfully seeing more of come close but don’t quite feel as immersive. In that way, there’s certainly a lot of fun to be had with the excessive screen real estate and power offered by the X17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSH56E"&gt;Furthermore, it easily proves its ability to play 4K games with finesse and that Alienware’s a little more serious about improving its chassis design. All of that progress is important, and if you’ve been waiting for a big, well-designed gaming laptop that delivers on the promise of 4K gaming on the go, this is it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z7sNUw"&gt;But for most people, it’s ultimately just too expensive. Plus, for the massive amount of power and cooling required to power 4K games, I just don’t think it offers &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much better of an experience to warrant the cost versus more affordable, yet no less competently designed, laptops with sharp QHD displays. Pocket the rest of your money for games, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;headset&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;mouse&lt;/a&gt;, or a gaming monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s handy AirTag Loop is selling for a low price at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RdZRLPH6sD6sTOhez3BP5gSK_o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104691/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now buy an AirTag Loop for $24 from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o0ereY"&gt;iPhone owners planning on traveling or making lots of plans this holiday season may find today’s AirTag Loop deal useful. Right now at Amazon, you can buy the handy loop made specifically to carry Apple’s ultrawideband-capable Bluetooth tracker at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PL9BF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an all-time low price of around $24&lt;/a&gt; instead of $29. This deal is valid on the orange or deep navy colorways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;Other colors are also on sale, but are selling for a little more. You can pick up the white or yellow variants for $26, for example. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;a very Apple move&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll need a loop to securely attach them to backpacks, keys, and other items. So, while you might be buying one a little begrudgingly, but you’ll probably be happy you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k18Xy5"&gt;Note, however, we have seen the deep navy AirTag loop plunge to as low as $19 on Adorama about a month ago, so there’s a possibility that other retailers may offer deeper discounts as we approach Black Friday. We’ll keep you updated on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Guide to Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NXz5v8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="MasfmJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzgh35"&gt;You can take great photos and video clips on your next trip while saving money thanks to today’s great deal on the newest GoPro action camera. Normally $500, Amazon and B&amp;amp;H are selling the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F6%2F22765943%2Fapple-airtag-hitman-3-gopro-hero-10-black-xbox-elite-series-2-controller-amazon-omni-fire-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero 10 Black&lt;/a&gt; for $450 instead. This GoPro Hero camera boasts all the amazing features its predecessor, which we called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;“biggest, baddest action camera out there,”&lt;/a&gt; and then some. What’s new here includes a new processor, which allows higher frame rates and increased resolution capture. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22675730/gopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWZLEC"&gt;If that’s a little out of your budget, the 2020 GoPro Hero 9 is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=45&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe78d2-1dd2-46cf-f21&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22527411%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — the biggest price drop we’ve seen for this model as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uYWoph"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YBmkuO"&gt;Xbox owners can now buy the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller for its best price yet. We once dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;“the best Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt;” when it was released in 2019, and you can now get it for $139 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; instead of $180, and $140 at &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/Jr4gqN"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Felite-wireless-controller-series-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yPT3S"&gt;The Series 2 makes it easy to customize buttons and analog sticks, while the built-in, rechargeable battery should last for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Wrap-around grips also make the controller easier to hold, while other highlights include adjustable-tension thumbsticks and support for both USB-C and Bluetooth. It’s compatible with the Xbox Series X / S consoles, as well as the Xbox One and Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4’s new teaser promises ‘the best spring break ever’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73mFnHhtIn3-x-PlGSBTCQkqvRI=/339x0:1530x794/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104641/eleven.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;has gotten yet another mysterious teaser trailer, the latest in a series of clips promoting the upcoming fourth series of Netflix’s flagship supernatural drama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fhkuw"&gt;We open with a voiceover of Eleven writing a letter to Mike, looking forward to spring break when she gets to see him again. She describes how much she likes school and has made lots of friends (even though we actually see other kids being mean to her). We then get a few quick cuts of a roller rink, Eleven watching skaters and looking upset with some creepy music playing, someone shooting through windows, Joyce looking at a creepy doll, government thugs restraining Eleven, helicopters, explosions, and a dial being turned up (but we cut away before we can see if it goes to eleven). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQK1uN"&gt;The new trailer, titled “Welcome to California,” is the fourth of Netflix’s teasers, which the company has been steadily counting off in its YouTube descriptions since February 2020. So far, we’ve had teaser 001 (“&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;From Russia With Love...&lt;/a&gt;” promising the return of a fan-favorite character), teaser 002 (“&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;Eleven, Are You Listening?&lt;/a&gt;” diving into Eleven’s dark past), and teaser 003 (“&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688804/stranger-things-season-4-teaser-trailer-watch-netflix"&gt;The Creel House,” revealing a creepy new location&lt;/a&gt;). Combined with the other three teasers, it seems clear that the new season is looking to expand its setting far beyond the town of Hawkins, Indiana in the coming season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWHb9m"&gt;Today’s new trailer is listed as 004/004, which would hopefully indicate that it’ll be the final of the smaller teasers for the series that Netflix is doing ahead of a proper, full-length trailer sometime in the future. Also absent from the news today is a firm release date: so far, Netflix has just said that it’ll be releasing the series sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMPrqy"&gt;The new announcements come as part of Netflix’s celebration of “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360"&gt;Stranger Things Day&lt;/a&gt;,” which is meant to “commemorate” the in-universe date of November 6th, 1983 — the day that Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) first disappeared into the dark Upside-Down dimension in the first season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things. &lt;/em&gt;(If one was feeling less charitable, one could also attribute it to a cynical and slightly desperate attempt to try and create a cash-in fan holiday for one of its most popular genre shows like May 4th’s “Star Wars Day.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wqyZHw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;November 6, 1983. The day Will Byers disappeared and the world turned upside down. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrangerThingsDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StrangerThingsDay&lt;/a&gt; returns tomorrow   &lt;a href="https://t.co/sRVrGwtvi0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sRVrGwtvi0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA3Ip"&gt;It’s been a longer than usual wait for the fourth season after &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3 — &lt;/em&gt;which was released in July 2019 — due to a months-long delay in production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which shut down filming on Stranger Things 4 after just two weeks in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfEblT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612753/netflix-stranger-things-season-four-release-date"&gt;set to return in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple hires Tesla’s former Autopilot software director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMqCseHCSAz0pNx9aaB2OkGI4uA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104568/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7dFWx"&gt;Apple hasn’t been all that vocal about its electric car project, but according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-05/apple-hires-tesla-s-autopilot-software-director-for-car-effort?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone maker is hiring Tesla’s Autopilot software engineer to work on its EVs. Sources close to the matter told&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Apple scooped up Christopher “CJ” Moore to work on its self-driving software. He’ll report to &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3649749-apple-said-to-picked-up-ex-tesla-exec-for-electric-car-push"&gt;Stuart Bowers, another Tesla ex-pat&lt;/a&gt; who previously served as the vice president of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrhHAb"&gt;During his time at Tesla, Moore stirred up controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims exaggerated&lt;/a&gt;. In January, Musk stated that he was “highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.” The full self-driving software, currently in beta, does not make a Tesla vehicle fully autonomous, as a driver must keep control of the vehicle at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kx5jcF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Moore stirred up controversy for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims an exaggeration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mtJrr"&gt;Moore pointed out that Tesla is currently at Level 2, referring to the vehicle’s level of autonomy — Level 2 means that the car still requires supervision from the driver, while Level 5 signifies full autonomy. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/tesla-engineer-who-quit-wanted-as-witness-in-key-autopilot-trial?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Moore has since been called as a witness&lt;/a&gt; to the fiery Tesla crash in April that left two people dead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;Initial reports suggested&lt;/a&gt; there was no one in the driver’s seat, but the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/ntsb-driver-seat-occupied-in-fatal-tesla-crash-in-spring-texas.html"&gt;said last month that its investigation showed&lt;/a&gt; the driver’s seat was occupied in that incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKQEAs"&gt;Apple’s electric car project, codenamed Project Titan, remains shrouded in secrecy. We do know, however, that Apple has been hiring EV experts from other companies — especially Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qElJsF"&gt;After Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;hired away the head of Apple’s car project, Doug Field&lt;/a&gt;, Apple replaced him with former Adobe CTO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch executive Kevin Lynch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;hired Ulrich Kranz, the co-founder of Canoo&lt;/a&gt; who helped BMW on its i3 and i8 programs. Apple previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18144421/apple-designer-andrew-kim-tesla-microsoft-xbox-one-s-hololens"&gt;poached designer Andrew Kim from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, along with Tesla’s drive systems &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/22/apple-tesla-engineering-vp-hire/"&gt;expert Michael Schwekutsch and car interiors/exteriors engineering vice president Steve MacManus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I spent hours waiting to find out what an NFT looks like IRL</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="People stand in front of tubes of TVs showing NFT artwork. The TVs are mounted against tubes of blue light." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRqhh1wuiDpUEfGabQgb_zfvbWw=/0x0:5908x3939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104399/dreamverse_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Dreamverse gallery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cRhQxE"&gt;New York City has been filled with NFTs this week. Since Monday, hundreds, if not thousands, of people have darted between talks, galleries, hangouts, parties, and other events assembled for and by the usually all-online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"&gt;NFT community&lt;/a&gt; to talk about the future of art, hype the space, and discover new and potentially soon-to-be-explosive projects. The result has been an exceptional number of hours spent in Times Square, one surprise Strokes concert, and a lot of dudes wearing crypto merch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlB6l7"&gt;Capping it all off was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/11/22666642/dreamverse-beeple-nft-inaugural-display-at-metapurse-party"&gt;a two-part event&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday called Dreamverse, hosted at the expansive music venue Terminal 5. The venue is tucked in between the car dealerships and wedding dress shops that inexplicably line the western edge of Manhattan beneath Central Park. For most of the afternoon, the event transformed Terminal 5 into a digital art gallery, showcasing rising NFT artists. Like Cinderella, it turned back into a nightclub in the evening, drawing in crowds with a headline performance by Alesso, a popular Swedish DJ, and what the event planners’ promised would be the “inaugural showcase” of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;Beeple’s $69 million NFT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FmBxPJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Very much like a normal art gallery, except filled with TVs and dudes wearing WAGMI hoodies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3RCCJI"&gt;I skipped out on most of the week’s programming but felt compelled to find out what it meant to see the so-called “authorized” debut of a work that I have already seen many, many times online and can download in 21,069 x 21,069 resolution whenever I’d like (the file is a browser-breaking 319MB large). I was also, conveniently, assigned to cover the event after I mentioned it in a meeting this week. Our editor-in-chief asked me to report back on the party, so I trekked up to Terminal 5 not once but twice to check it out. (The gallery and subsequent party / unveiling were separated by a 4-hour gap, during which I ate a burrito and watched YouTube videos in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s office.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaQ895"&gt;The gallery itself was very much like a normal art gallery, except filled with TVs and dudes wearing WAGMI hoodies. For all the discussions around what NFTs mean for art, it turns out they mean very little so far for displaying art to the public. Dozens of pieces were on display around the venue, rotating in and out on the many TVs that had been mounted throughout the space to present the entirely digital works. Some were animated; some were still. But mostly, it was a space to showcase a style of art that’s popular online — glossy, with a sci-fi edge and occasional grotesque element — but wouldn’t show up in a traditional gallery. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNrg1idpVXVZVTYY3eEO7uoL5WI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22990155/dreamverse_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;At the center of the Dreamverse gallery was a series of TVs mounted on color-changing tubes of light.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xIFoQI"&gt;The event was put together by Metapurse, the group behind the $69 million acquisition of a Beeple NFT back in March, and the art they curated largely felt like works that could live within the same world as Beeple. One piece, from Pussy Riot, showed a man / pig hybrid crawling toward a grave with a large vaginal opening. Another work showed a figure in a Guy Fawkes mask holding a glowing bitcoin. The artworks were labeled with QR codes, which all seemed to direct to Twitter accounts rather than a blockchain address or NFT marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B868Nj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Everyone thought everyone else was more into NFTs than they were&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gabTi"&gt;The venue contained three floors of this — occasional series of TVs, glowing tubes of light for decor, and a VR installation in one spot, in which you could walk through a &lt;em&gt;virtual &lt;/em&gt;NFT gallery inside this &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;NFT gallery — plus a roof space on top where, most notably, there was sunlight, and smoking was allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzDzXX"&gt;When I wandered up to the roof, I found a bunch of people crowded around a man holding what appeared to be a deck of tarot cards. People gaped, and cameras pushed in as he showed off a single card as part of what I assumed was some sort of magic trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEwx7V"&gt;“Do you know who this guy is?” asked a man next to me. Neither of us knew who he was. He turned out to be Twobadour, one of the managers of Metapurse and a central figure of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk2mqT"&gt;There were lots of small confusions like this. So many of the people I talked to told me they were &lt;em&gt;interested &lt;/em&gt;in NFTs, but they weren’t &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; into it as the other people there — or, at least, the NFT fiends we all imagined were around us. These gallery-goers weren’t holding the Blue Chip NFTs. They couldn’t recognize Twobadour or Metakovan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327594/metakovan-beeple-highest-auction-price-69-million-nft"&gt;the two Metapurse leaders&lt;/a&gt;. (Although a line of several dozen people formed at one point to take selfies with Beeple, who was neatly dressed in a blue sweater over a white oxford.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ72f"&gt;One person I spoke to, who told me he’s more into Bitcoin than NFTs, said he was skeptical of NFTs’ value but came because he wanted to see what a digital art gallery looked like. As I left, he followed after me to make a suggestion for my article, imploring me to “put in something about the emperor’s new clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="O67EDZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s crazy, bro, we live in a fucking video game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9K4aB"&gt;When I came back around 8PM for the party and Beeple unveiling, many of the art displays had vanished, and the venue was getting packed. There were a bunch of guys in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664469/bored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount"&gt;Bored Ape Yacht Club hoodies&lt;/a&gt;, someone walking around in a space suit, and an inordinate number of women wearing berets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SotBbZ"&gt;One guy wearing a Bored Ape hoodie told me the Dreamverse event was too expensive, and another NFT party was more popping. He didn’t own an ape, but he got invited as a plus-one to &lt;a href="https://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-strokes-lil-baby-beck-more-played-brooklyn-steel-last-night/"&gt;the Bored Ape party&lt;/a&gt; the night before, where Aziz Ansari came on stage to introduce a performance by Beck. After that, Chris Rock came on stage to introduce a performance by The Strokes. Ah, I think, so these people own hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of NFTs that they refuse to sell &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;get to see my favorite band play for free? How lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vf6LyhLHobdXdZXgKo4GYWazb2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22990163/dreamverse_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The opening DJ, PLS&amp;amp;TY, plays for the not-yet-packed venue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LR2raQ"&gt;Another guy in a Bored Ape hoodie (who owns a mutant ape but not an ape proper) told me he was given a ticket to Dreamverse for free by a guy he’d just met who couldn’t make it. It’s all about the NFT community element, he said. He and the ticket gifter had spent the previous night on a scavenger hunt across the city that was somehow related to a pseudonymous NFT figure named Wagmi-san.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNmcag"&gt;“It’s crazy, bro, we live in a fucking video game,” he shouted at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXrILs"&gt;Unfortunately for me, a journalist who had come primarily to report on what Beeple’s artwork looked like in person, the NFT was not yet on display at this point. Beeple himself was hanging out in a corner holding beer and chatting with some people, though, so I figured I’d say hi. I’d spoken to him earlier this year, and I figured I should get a quote for this article — but a bouncer pushed me away when I got too close. Beeple left moments later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okZgwd"&gt;Eventually, an opening DJ went out and played for a while. Then he went off, and a bunch of Kanye remixes played for a while. The Beeple was still not on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GU0a75"&gt;Some time afterward, I ended up in a conversation with an artist and an&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;employee of a major NFT exchange. They asked for my honest feelings about NFTs. I hesitated before answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmimGo"&gt;“We won’t be offended,” the artist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D36R62"&gt;I said that it’s fascinating how many vibrant communities have formed around them and that I love how they’re directing money to artists. I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; said that I think NFTs are a pyramid scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrFfsk"&gt;The artist was offended. The other person said the blockchain is forever and that this imbues value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vZrnD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waiting to experience “a bespoke three-story-tall hybrid physical and digital structure”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="deywUl"&gt;Finally, the music stopped, and the lights came up, and an emcee came on stage. He was wearing a floral jacket and holding a large gavel that he at no point used. He told the audience that they have to download an app so we could all take part in a communal AR experience. “Don’t activate the app. Just download it. Please,” he pleaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GscrLD"&gt;People started chanting for Alesso. He said they have to wait and please download the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6j7Utc"&gt;At this point, the Beeple still had not appeared. It was 11:30PM, and Terminal 5 is very far from my home. I wanted to get to bed, but I was also curious how they were going to bring out the Beeple since the presentation Dreamverse promised — “a bespoke three-story-tall hybrid physical and digital structure” — sounded elaborate and impressive, and there was no elaborate and impressive three-story-tall hybrid physical and digital structure in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4sAUk"&gt;It turned out, that exquisite work of public relations was just code for &lt;em&gt;a screen&lt;/em&gt;. The screen, which has been behind the opening act DJs all night, started flashing — the emcee issued a halfhearted seizure warning — and eventually, the Beeple appeared stretched across the display. A short animation played, zooming into the Beeple, panning around, zooming out, panning, zooming in, showing the details and then the aggregate, repeating. It’s a few minutes long. Then the screen turned black, and people cheered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A cropped section of the Beeple is displayed on stage. Stage equipment sits in front of the display." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIlPCTdzxQphHjSPNdIyIDuC_AQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22990164/dreamverse_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The $69 million Beeple, seen from the back of the venue, at an angle, because who knew this thing would only be on display for a matter of minutes? A partially zoomed in look at the artwork is shown above.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mwQPgf"&gt;Metakovan came on stage and said a few words. “Thanks a lot, guys. See ya in the metaverse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWms1g"&gt;Alesso came on. People cheered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ztJzH"&gt;I was ready to leave, but to fulfill my professional duties, I had to figure out what the AR app thing was all about. Everyone around me had their phones out, but they were all recording video of the Beeple debut — no one was actually using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bRuzOI"&gt;My own internet connection had been too slow to download the app in time, so I asked the guy beside me what it was like. He couldn’t get the app to work either. I left.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult, especially with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; just on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744497/macos-12-monterey-apple-mac-download-available-now"&gt;recently-released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5M7S6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $900. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all three colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,150, its second-best price to date. These deals can come and go quickly, though, but we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; last month, the company introduced a new M1 line of CPUs as well as updates to both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros. There are multiple variants of both models, though, we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration yet outside of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s $50 discount on the 14-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. But with the largest shopping event of the year just around the corner, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KS0G3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="h4rH4i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the latest MacBook Pro line were absolutely beaming with praise. Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there's a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for nearly $200 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,100. The larger, 512GB variant is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,349, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older, Intel-powered device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in several configurations at Amazon, including one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999 and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,500, which is almost $500 off the list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the last-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 is still on sale, but has been outpaced in nearly every category with the release of the new MacBook Pros that use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. However, you can still grab the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWiTGrpT1N" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,299 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of that, deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $649&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $750&lt;/a&gt;. Costco members can also &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-512gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694240.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase the 512GB model for the same price&lt;/a&gt;, though, no other retailers are offering the discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="APBdOd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, some retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ref_US_EBF21_P1_GW_Desk_DealsSingle_DOTD_ENES=&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=3488afaa-3745-41ec-bed9-8c643eff58e9&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=JWNIH&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=2DJTCZEMSEHW2K3CCY8Y&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=gdIC3&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=652b3660-a90a-45ff-b04c-3e93a23460c4&amp;amp;ref_=pd_gw_unk"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1, and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=44&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=43&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLLL2o"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzQ1NzMzL2Jlc3Qtbm9pc2UtY2FuY2VsaW5nLWhlYWRwaG9uZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb052c11d"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, are currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for their lowest price to date&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $350, this deal brings these cans down to $248. Along with industry-leading noise cancellation, our reviewer Chris Welch particularly liked the improved voice quality and the addition of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. These over-ear headphones can last up to 30 hours on a single charge, too, and provide a comfortable listening experience with plush ear pads. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzU2MzEzL3NvbnktMTAwMHhtNC1ub2lzZS1jYW5jZWxpbmctaGVhZHBob25lcy1yZXZpZXctcHJpY2Utc3BlY3MtZmVhdHVyZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6a37a9ea"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in white for $235. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WyI5ia"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is a smart 4K monitor that acts like a TV for your PC, one you can mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $520, its best price to date, with a solar-powered remote control. The monitor can stream HDR10 content from popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2. It also supports Google Assistant and Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j22lU8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;). The retailer is also taking more than 50 percent off the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-Indoor-Security-Camera-Detection/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last year’s Fire HD 8 tablets&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WplKkW"&gt;Both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDYPWK7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are selling for $40 right now instead of $60, which is a good deal on what we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;recently praised&lt;/a&gt; as an amazing action game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $190 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning Best Buy will refund the difference in price of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;

These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iY7ZPM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzQ1NzMzL2Jlc3Qtbm9pc2UtY2FuY2VsaW5nLWhlYWRwaG9uZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb052c11d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $350. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzU2MzEzL3NvbnktMTAwMHhtNC1ub2lzZS1jYW5jZWxpbmctaGVhZHBob25lcy1yZXZpZXctcHJpY2Utc3BlY3MtZmVhdHVyZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6a37a9ea" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $190.

If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $119 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Typically $100, the retailer currently has it for $60 instead. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTAxMzAwL2dvb2dsZS1uZXN0LWF1ZGlvLWFzc2lzdGFudC1zbWFydC1zcGVha2VyLXJldmlldy1wcmljZS1zcGVjcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B30e88024" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert praised the Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for being a notable improvement over the original Google Home in every way. It touts improved audio quality, it’s faster at registering Google Assistant queries, and you can easily pair two of them together for stereo sound. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTAxMzAwL2dvb2dsZS1uZXN0LWF1ZGlvLWFzc2lzdGFudC1zbWFydC1zcGVha2VyLXJldmlldy1wcmljZS1zcGVjcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C30e88024" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0cXUQh"&gt;Best Buy is also selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWe6PKFYjN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; for its best price to date in select colors and sizes. The 40mm black version with GPS, for example, is currently going for $199 instead of $250. The Galaxy Watch 4 is Samsung’s first device to run the new Wear OS 3 platform that Google and Samsung &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvNy8yMi8yMjU4ODQ0MC9nb29nbGUtd2Vhci1vcy0zLXVwZGF0ZS1zbWFydHdhdGNoLXNhbXN1bmctMjAyMg/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B790b9543" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have been working on together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNjI5NDU5L2dhbGF4eS13YXRjaC00LWNsYXNzaWMtcmV2aWV3LWJpeGJ5LWdvb2dsZS13ZWFyb3M/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb90406be" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how much we enjoyed using the watch when paired with a Samsung phone, praising its performance, improved third-party app support, and expansive health tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KJVtaJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max have been available for less, but the cheapest place to get them right now is at Best Buy, where you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkuem3dVe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a pair in any color for $479&lt;/a&gt;, $70 off the regular MSRP. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ysr84c"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which allows you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jv2SvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptops 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNqjUh"&gt;First off, the Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,200&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt;, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great, and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TALLIn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KJNFBG"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th, and has been running similar deals every week since. The retail store also officially launched its weekly &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Holiday Best” deals&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, which run every Sunday online and in-store. Target RedCard holders can save an additional 5 percent while enjoying free shipping, and the store will be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="69Dp0C"&gt;Target is currently offering Black Friday deals &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/ZdB3AQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on TVs from LG, Samsung, TCL, and more&lt;/a&gt;. The store is also offering the same discount on various sizes of the LG C1 and Samsung’s The Frame as Amazon, and including a six-month subscription to HBO Max as well. However, as we mentioned before, Target RedCard members are also eligible for a five percent discount, which means they could buy the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1176910/2092?subId1=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-48-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled48c1%2F-%2FA-82219816%3Fclkid%3D64ecedacN58e711ea9b2c42010a246e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch LG C1 for $1,045&lt;/a&gt; instead of the discounted $1,100 Amazon currently offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmYUbz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lV9ukd"&gt;Alternatively, Target RedCard members can pick up the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/9WOv9y" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch version of The Frame&lt;/a&gt;, which has an MSRP of $1,300, for $853 instead of the discounted $898. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VYKZW4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847926"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ITUAT"&gt;Like Amazon and Best Buy, Target is also &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/15REQB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting Sony’s $350 WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzQ1NzMzL2Jlc3Qtbm9pc2UtY2FuY2VsaW5nLWhlYWRwaG9uZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb052c11d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. However, RedCard members can also get a five percent discount, which means you’d be paying $238 instead of the $250 sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="44w5fy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is currently selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7moVRr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $180 through November 6th, which beats Amazon’s all-time low of $199. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKPeGe"&gt;Also on the TV front, Target is taking $350 off the 65-inch version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/donjWq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Element’s affordable, frameless Roku TV&lt;/a&gt; through November 6th. Normally $650, the TV is currently on sale for $300, more than half off the original price. The 4K Ultra HD TV is compatible with HDR10, offers a 60Hz native refresh rate, and has four HDMI ports. It also supports Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, while additionally working with Chromecast and Apple’s AirPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W2j4hz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10834759"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/YgB3Am" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now through November 6th, a cool $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2XWmQV"&gt;Target is offering up to 60 percent off &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9QDKd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;select video games&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles through November 6th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mo7Agr"&gt;Like Best Buy, Target is also selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/RymJDN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for $60 instead of $100 until November 7th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;The retailer is also selling a silver version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/a12Qob" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S. Mode&lt;/a&gt; for $340 instead of $540 through November 6th. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue supercenter recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire as soon as November 7th. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;While many of these deals aren’t live yet, we’ve collected a handful that piqued our interest below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $59&lt;/a&gt; until November 7th. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The GoPro Hero 8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart will be offering the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q7R0XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwKlAu"&gt;One of our favorite budget tablets from last year just got a little cheaper. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Tab-A7-32GB-10-4-Wi-Fi-Gray-SM-T500NZABXAR%2F882296471" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;going to be on sale at Walmart for $140&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. This brings it well below the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, which features 32GB of internal storage and a 10.4-inch display. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were with the vibrant display and sturdy build quality of this unassuming tablet. It’s not going to rival, say, the latest iPad Air or Mini, but it remains a solid entertainment device, especially if you plan to consume Amazon content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UxwtI2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wijGQu"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip, and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTGFc4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzgh35"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is selling the popular action cam for $450 instead. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more.
