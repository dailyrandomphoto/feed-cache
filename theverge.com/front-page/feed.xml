    <title>Hulu’s animated MODOK series looks like Robot Chicken meets Marvel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbD2g30xE1GShm8_fcPicggRgNc=/203x0:2279x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876431/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_4.25.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XcDRm1"&gt;Hulu has released the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;MODOK&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming animated show that will see Patton Oswalt voice the titular Marvel villain in a more light-hearted,&lt;em&gt; Robot Chicken&lt;/em&gt;-style take on the franchise’s usual portentous superhero dramas. The show also got a release date: it’ll debut on May 21st on the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62nyve"&gt;MODOK (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing) has been a long-running bad guy in Marvel Comics as the leader of the evil scientific group AIM. (A more serious take on the character serves as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21422708/marvel-avengers-review-single-player-campaign-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;primary antagonist for Square Enix’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; video game, released last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00FS3z"&gt;In the new Hulu animated series, MODOK has managed to bankrupt AIM, resulting in the supervillain being fired as the organization’s leader and leaving the massive floating head to sort out his professional and family problems on his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yoefih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;MODOK gets his day in the sun&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNPeoh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MODOK &lt;/em&gt;was originally part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220473/hulu-marvel-animated-series-howard-the-duck-modok-hit-monkey-tigra-dazzler-offenders-kevin-smith"&gt;larger slate of animated Marvel shows&lt;/a&gt; planned for Hulu in 2019 by the now-defunct Marvel TV, alongside &lt;em&gt;Hit-Monkey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tigra &amp;amp; Dazzler&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Howard the Duck &lt;/em&gt;series. The four shows were then slated to cross over in a special called &lt;em&gt;The Offenders &lt;/em&gt;(a take on existing crossover shows like the &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; films or Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Defenders&lt;/em&gt; for its Marvel heroes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcelPc"&gt;Those plans would be upended later in 2019 &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/12/marvel-tv-shut-down-layoffs-jeph-loeb-kevin-feige-1202805979/"&gt;when Marvel TV was shut down&lt;/a&gt;, studio head Jeph Loeb (who was overseeing the new animated shows) left the company, and future Marvel TV efforts were placed under Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios division (which has a staggering number of Marvel shows planned for Disney Plus over the next several years). Shows that were already in development under Marvel TV — like the final seasons of &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525187/ghost-rider-helstrom-hulu-live-action-marvel-shows-2020"&gt;Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;Helstrom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;MODOK &lt;/em&gt;— were allowed to finish up their work, but the other shows were summarily canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbutco"&gt;In that light, &lt;em&gt;MODOK &lt;/em&gt;isn’t just a wacky spin on the Marvel universe; it’s a final glimpse at a different path that the company’s comics adaptations could have taken before the MCU fully took over the future of Marvel TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmyMUb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Dragon Age will reportedly be single-player only amid other shifts at EA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pPVsCTE1IwehNU99toDe7Cddwc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876369/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_12.54.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qy4law"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; game will no longer have multiplayer aspects, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/electronic-arts-pivots-on-dragon-age-game-removes-multiplayer"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. The game, made by EA-owned studio BioWare, had reportedly “been designed with a heavy multiplayer component,” but it has been turned into a single-player game “in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USxXBZ"&gt;However, we still haven’t seen much of the game since it was first announced with a brief teaser trailer in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018"&gt;December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and we don’t know what the multiplayer component could have looked like. Even though the game has been in the works for some time — development started in 2015, reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; — there’s still no release date for it just yet, meaning it could be a ways off, and things could change. BioWare recently showed fleeting glimpses of the game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21404442/dragon-age-4-behind-the-scenes-bts-bioware"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sUIK4I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The change comes amid other developments at EA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uF2dTh"&gt;The change comes amid other developments that have apparently led EA to be more willing to embrace a single-player-only &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;. On Wednesday, EA announced that &lt;em&gt;Anthem Next&lt;/em&gt;, the planned reboot of BioWare’s live service open-world shooter &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22274771/ea-wont-continue-anthems-post-launch-development"&gt;has been canceled&lt;/a&gt; (though EA says the game “as it exists today” will continue). And EA’s single-player title &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt;, which launched in November 2019,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;exceeded sales expectations, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoJ3k2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; became one of BioWare’s marquee franchises based on its engrossing single-player campaigns, so the news that the next title won’t have multiplayer is likely welcome news for many fans. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-is-putting-the-future-of-its-franchises-including-titanfall-into-its-studios-hands"&gt;In a recent interview with &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, EA’s studios chief Laura Miele said the company has been listening to what players want and is making decisions based on that feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akReWd"&gt;“I asked [EA’s community leaders] to give me their best advice on how we can have a better connection to our players,” Miele said. “The biggest theme was — please listen to us about the content players are asking for, which resulted in us green lighting [the new] &lt;em&gt;Skate&lt;/em&gt;, College Football, &lt;em&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/em&gt; and additional content for &lt;em&gt;Battlefront II&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qI2Ws"&gt;EA has also canceled a years-in-development game codenamed “Gaia,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/electronic-arts-cancels-gaia-game-after-years-in-development"&gt;according to another &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Gaia’s&lt;/em&gt; development was turbulent and the game went through at least one major reboot,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported. If you’re curious, you can get a brief look at some early footage of Gaia&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jMQ4n2922qI"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oxford lab studying the coronavirus was victim of a cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36-0Rjq94xDCa45VopqDE6ZDZPM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876361/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JyH849"&gt;Oxford University disclosed on Thursday that one of its research labs dedicated in part to studying COVID-19 suffered a cyberattack, following an &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/25/exclusive-hackers-break-into-biochemical-systems-at-oxford-uni-lab-studying-covid-19/?sh=3f7d621e2a39"&gt;investigation from &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;indicating external access to a number of the lab’s systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spnFK2"&gt;The lab is part of Oxford’s Division of Structural Biology, known as “Strubi.” There’s no indication the lab or its research had any direct connection to ongoing COVID-19 vaccine development conducted by the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute. But it’s unclear exactly what data may have been compromised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIrDd0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;says it was shown proof of the intrusion by Alex Holden, the chief technology officer of a cybersecurity firm called Hold Security, who provided screenshots showing access to lab equipment with active intruders as recent as February 14th. It’s not clear if the intent was to steal valuable lab data or to potentially sabotage ongoing research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tKVEVo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lab was not involved in COVID-19 vaccine development&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pob30n"&gt;“We have identified and contained the problem and are now investigating further,” an Oxford University spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;. “There has been no impact on any clinical research, as this is not conducted in the affected area.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpA0r3"&gt;Oxford confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;that some of the machines that were accessed included purification devices for handling biochemical samples, some of which included proteins used in ongoing coronavirus research. &lt;em&gt;Forbes &lt;/em&gt;reports that the attackers may not have been connected to any nation-state and instead may have been seeking out valuable research to sell on underground markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOj19W"&gt;Oxford contacted the UK’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), which now says it’s conducting an investigation. “We are aware of an incident affecting Oxford University and are working to fully understand its impact,” an NCSC spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Forbes. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it won’t loosen COVID-19 policies after Oversight Board request</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtZ4gYrqoUKCRjZ-fjNScpRZy2s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876286/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="21GGFk"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/facebook-response-to-the-oversight-boards-first-set-of-recommendations/"&gt;has decided whether to adopt recommendations&lt;/a&gt; the Facebook Oversight Board made last month when the board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755133/facebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-first-cases-hate-speech-pandemic-misinformation"&gt;decided its first round of appeals from users&lt;/a&gt;. Among its responses, Facebook said it would not loosen standards on taking down COVID-19 misinformation, but it would test informing users whether a human or an automated filtering system deleted their post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r62gRv"&gt;The Oversight Board made 17 recommendations based on the six cases it examined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;Unlike the board’s decisions&lt;/a&gt; regarding the appeals cases, Facebook is not required to adopt the recommendations, but it agrees that it will at least consider them. However, several of the responses were noncommittal, with one promising to “continue to explore how best to provide transparency [...] within the limits of what is technologically feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5R7bLv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many of Facebook’s plans point toward increasing transparency and clarity around its rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="01rzrT"&gt;The one recommendation Facebook says it will not do anything about stems from a case where Facebook removed a user’s post for saying that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were effective COVID treatments. The company says it will not follow the recommendation to reduce its enforcement against posts that contain misinformation that could lead to “imminent harm,” as it disagrees with the board’s interpretation of the phrase based on its consultation with global health organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnRS7w"&gt;One of the more interesting responses is how Facebook plans to clarify its policies around its ban on “dangerous individuals and organizations,” including hate figures. The board suggested the clarification after Facebook removed a post attributing a quote to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, but the user said they had intended to compare Goebbels unfavorably to former President Donald Trump. Facebook plans to add language to indicate that it could remove posts containing hateful content if it’s not unambiguously condemned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0hmtw"&gt;Facebook also plans to test a feature where it lets users know if one of their posts was automatically removed. If the feature sticks around, it should provide some insight into whether it was a human who removed the post after reviewing it or an automated system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie addresses major Destiny 2 player complaints with massive changes on the horizon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eH-NEu8RMLlYFIGUSvABBVKrCsU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876272/media_wallaper_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5G0i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, Bungie’s long-running online sci-fi shooter, has a year of substantial changes ahead of it, according to a new roadmap the studio &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50124"&gt;detailed in an extensive blog post published on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. While the game’s next major expansion, &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, has been delayed to early 2022, Bungie says it has major overhauls planned for nearly every aspect of the game — from the competitive multiplayer Crucible mode to how players progress and become more powerful across the game’s seasonal expansion model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miQTtB"&gt;One of the biggest changes slated for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is a major crossplay implementation that will, for the first time, allow players on PC and players on consoles to join one another for activities. In its blog post, Bungie said crossplay is coming later this year in season 15, and most importantly, the studio confirms it will not mandate crossplay for competitive activities as many fans feared. “Don’t worry, we won’t be matching console and PC players together in the Crucible unless PC players specifically invite their console friends to play with them in the PC Crucible pools,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXUmbX"&gt;There are a ton of other major changes planned, many of which address long-standing player complaints. Here’s a rundown of some of the more significant ones: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCDa4q"&gt;Bungie will no longer “sunset” weapons and armor by making older items obsolete. The studio says “any weapon or armor that can currently be infused to max power will continue to be able to reach max power permanently.” That’s a huge relief for players who’ve been frustrated at the sunsetting experiment over the last year leaving behind fan-favorite gear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCExZc"&gt;The Vault of Glass, &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;’s very first raid, is coming back as part of the &lt;em&gt;Destiny Content Vault&lt;/em&gt; in season 14 this summer. Bungie now says it will eventually launch a “master” difficult version to align the raid with the game’s hardest player versus environment (PvE) activities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Js0dns"&gt;Bungie is planning an “overhaul” of the ultra-competitive Trials of Osiris game mode to improve matchmaking, rebuild the incentivize structure to encourage less skilled players to compete, and to figure out ways to allow solo players to participate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XHBcTO"&gt;Bungie has outlined major changes to how its Darkness-based Stasis subclass functions in both PvE and PvP activities to tone down its dominance against human opponents and bring the older subclasses up to par. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HP34vT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;will no longer force players to grind out 50 power level points every season and will instead introduce minor season expansions with just a 10 power level jump. That should make it easier for players to sink back into the game at the start of new seasons and not feel pressured to level up. (This is my personal favorite announcement of the day.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s5RUgj"&gt;Many of these changes represent Bungie’s renewed effort to listen to its diehard fans, many of whom have been playing &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;and its predecessor since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrkxmc"&gt;Common complaints include exhausting grinds to reach max power level and enjoy the game’s most rewarding activities, a lack of attention and focus on the competitive Crucible game mode, and inconsistencies in the depth and richness of certain expansions versus others that can result in long content draughts and little incentive to keep playing. Bungie appears to be tackling all of this with its 2021 plans, all leading up to the eventual release of &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GUTG7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Destiny universe looks more promising than ever &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRpOCi"&gt;The studio has weathered countless storms before, including a near-constant ebb and flow between extreme player satisfaction and frenzied outrage. With last year’s &lt;em&gt;Beyond Light,&lt;/em&gt; Bungie signaled it was ready to push the &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;universe toward a longer-term scope with a more service-oriented model and a more cohesive vision for the game’s story and structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq80Lj"&gt;Effectively, this meant no &lt;em&gt;Destiny 3&lt;/em&gt;; the series would move forward in its current state and evolve over time, like a proper MMO or live service game. And last week, the company also &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50109"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a major shuffle of its executive leadership and a studio expansion that includes an expansion of the &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;universe into “additional media,” opening the door to film and TV and other formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuwlaA"&gt;Bungie has proven that it’s more than capable of listening to feedback and focusing its attention and resources where they matter most, and this most recent roadmap is making &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; look more promising than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook now wants to make ‘Hey Facebook’ a thing</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SJQry"&gt;Facebook has introduced a new “Hey Facebook” wake word for its family of Portal smart displays and the Oculus Quest platform. The company only &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fsay-hey-facebook-to-stay-hands-free-with-oculus-quest-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301697%2Foculus-portal-smart-display-hey-facebook-wake-word-quest-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;formally announced it&lt;/a&gt; was gradually rolling out to Quest headsets, but its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F743419682779926%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301697%2Foculus-portal-smart-display-hey-facebook-wake-word-quest-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portal support page now lists&lt;/a&gt; “Hey Facebook” as an alternative to “Hey Portal.” A look through the Wayback Machine shows it used to only list “Hey Portal” as &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210205040527/https://portal.facebook.com/help/2149102838698668/"&gt;recently as February 5th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARaIyB"&gt;Oculus owners can fret a little less knowing that it’s launching as an opt-in feature, buried in the Experimental Features panel within the headset’s settings. Oculus says it will remain that way, too, which was smart to mention, knowing that some users might fear it’ll become mandatory. You can also still use the Voice Commands app to issue commands by double-tapping the Oculus button without opting in to use the “Hey Facebook” wake word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uhXXLV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an opt-in feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RB6tFN"&gt;This seems like a natural progression for the Portal devices, but it’s more confusing for Oculus headsets, where saying “Hey Oculus” would make more sense. The intent of having it on the headset is to let you do things with your voice so that you don’t need to interrupt the VR action as much. The reasoning is sound, but it might still infuriate some users who oppose Facebook’s ever-growing presence in virtual reality. This just marks the next step.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ealwFI"&gt;We haven’t been able to verify if “Hey Facebook” works with Portal devices yet. But this feature is gradually rolling out to Quest 2 users first starting today and later to all Quest headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Live is down with users unable to sign in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujv09mufEcPrCzsu9-Jnu7YfLQQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876185/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5usoKn"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is down, preventing users from signing in to the service. The Xbox Live problems started at around 3:15PM ET today, and Microsoft has confirmed it’s investigating the outage. “We are aware that users may not be able to sign-in to Xbox Live at this time,” says Xbox support. “Our teams are currently investigating to fix this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iuq74B"&gt;If you’re not already signed in to your Xbox, the sign-in process will fail with an error, preventing access to certain services like Xbox Party chat. Some apps may also fail to launch without the core Xbox Live services being online, and a number of games will also not launch correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIuAGN"&gt;Microsoft has marked the Xbox Live issues as a “major outage” over at the company’s &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status"&gt;Xbox status page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L9qd0r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are aware that users may not be able to sign-in to Xbox Live at this time. Our teams are currently investigating to fix this issue. We will update here and on &lt;a href="https://t.co/PzAdjUFMJj"&gt;https://t.co/PzAdjUFMJj&lt;/a&gt; when we have more information to share!&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Support (@XboxSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1365043994552455168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SUcrK"&gt;This is the first big Xbox Live outage since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559320/xbox-live-login-problems-xbox-series-s-series-x"&gt;issues occurred&lt;/a&gt; during the Xbox Series X and Series S launch in November last year. Xbox Live also went down a few times throughout 2020, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic when the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188972/microsoft-xbox-live-outage-down-second-time-multiplayer-service-disruption"&gt;faced issues twice in a week&lt;/a&gt; as millions started social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fisker quietly settled trade secret spat with VW-backed battery company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VlTpGBVQUHyh6emXwFXVyMzI9qM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875933/jbareham_180108_2235_0095.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYGNKQ"&gt;Fisker Inc. quietly settled a previously unreported trade secret lawsuit with Volkswagen-backed solid-state battery company QuantumScape last July, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. The suit, filed in April 2019 in Santa Clara Superior Court, was centered on a former QuantumScape employee who brought thousands of confidential documents with her to a new job at Fisker Inc. in late 2018 and early 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61jx8k"&gt;While the lawsuit played out, Fisker Inc. locked away those documents and the work done by the employee, and even “quarantined” battery cells made while she worked there, though it ultimately argued the information was public domain. As part of the settlement, Fisker Inc. ultimately agreed to delete or destroy the documents the employee brought with her. Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000119312520313931/d92481d424b3.htm"&gt;recently disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; that it agreed to pay $750,000 in cash to settle claims of trade secret misappropriation in July 2020, though it did not name QuantumScape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vqhdJe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fisker paid $750,000 as part of the settlement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hH7cB"&gt;The suit was settled at the same time that Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322573/fisker-vw-meb-modular-platform-architecture-ocean-suv-apollo"&gt;was trying to strike a deal with Volkswagen to power its first SUV&lt;/a&gt;, the Ocean, with the German automaker’s new modular electric vehicle platform. Those talks have fallen apart, though, as the two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;blew past their deadline to strike a deal&lt;/a&gt;. Fisker Inc. has since contracted automotive supplier Magna to build the Ocean SUV and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;an agreement with iPhone-maker Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; to build a second vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3C7ru"&gt;Volkswagen made a $100 million investment in QuantumScape in 2018 and &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-increases-stake-in-quantumscape-6136"&gt;added another $200 million to the joint venture last June&lt;/a&gt;. But the German automaker has been collaborating with the battery company since 2012. A Stanford spinout, QuantumScape is one of many companies working on solid-state batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte found in lithium-ion batteries with a solid material that could help increase energy density, allow faster charging, and reduce the risk of fire. Like Fisker Inc, QuantumScape merged with a special purpose acquisition company last year and is now publicly traded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDGSLg"&gt;In 2019, Fisker Inc. delayed a luxury sports car that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18270350/henrik-fisker-electric-suv-karma-emotion-delayed"&gt;was supposed to use the solid-state battery it was developing&lt;/a&gt; because the tech wasn’t ready. QuantumScape argued in the lawsuit that the employee, battery researcher Anna Choi, and Fisker Inc. tried to use the information to “redirect Fisker’s development of the thin film ceramic electrolyte for its lithium-based battery to emulate QuantumScape’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PmsdAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric cars could use another big battery breakthrough — this CEO says he’s got it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17695866/henrik-fisker-solid-state-batteries-electric-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTDzmY"&gt;QuantumScape described in the suit how Choi brought confidential material to Fisker Inc. before and after taking a job with the EV startup, and she admitted to doing so as part of the settlement. QuantumScape also tried to argue Choi was directed by Fisker Inc. executives to bring over the confidential material, including co-founder Geeta Gupta Fisker and then-head of battery development Fabio Albano. Gupta Fisker and Albano separately denied this, and Fisker Inc. claimed Choi acted of her own volition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjPtfU"&gt;Choi and QuantumScape did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Albano and a spokesperson for Volkswagen declined to comment. Fisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker declined to comment on the lawsuit in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TQe43I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Choi gave Fisker a 52-slide PowerPoint “playbook” of QuantumScape’s innovations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5C7L8"&gt;According to the lawsuit, the trouble started when Choi gave Fisker Inc. a 52-slide PowerPoint — described in the heavily redacted lawsuit as a “virtual playbook” to key QuantumScape innovations and trade secrets, with “detailed recipes, processes, [and] ingredients” — in an interview with the EV startup on November 20th, 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEsQ4t"&gt;“Immediately after her interview, [Fisker Inc.] began peppering Choi with requests for her ‘recommendations’ regarding equipment to be used, vendors, and pricing,” lawyers for QuantumScape wrote in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QV4xxM"&gt;QuantumScape further claimed Choi “emailed highly confidential QuantumScape materials to her personal Yahoo email account” on December 11th and 12th in 2018. On December 14th, again met with Fisker Inc. at the EV startup’s Torrance, California headquarters to attend its holiday party, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bbQyF"&gt;That same day, QuantumScape said Choi logged in to the company’s secure intranet system from an IP address “publicly associated with Fisker” and “reviewed and downloaded several dozen highly confidential technical documents to which she had been granted restricted access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WhiuNY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fisker said it had no use for the information, and argued it was public anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="An619d"&gt;Fisker Inc.’s legal team pushed back on this, arguing that QuantumScape was broadly using the term “trade secrets” to refer to public information about its battery tech, and “because QuantumScape utterly failed to reasonably protect the secrecy of its ‘trade secrets’ by allowing Choi ‘unfettered and unmonitored access to its networks,’ according to a filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8d8bp"&gt;“It was only by chance (because Choi referenced a QuantumScape item number on a call with a third-party supplier) did QuantumScape learn of Choi’s activity,” lawyers for Fisker Inc. wrote. “[D]espite Choi’s unilateral actions, Fisker never wanted any QuantumScape confidential information, and it has not used any QuantumScape non-public information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tavrv"&gt;Fisker Inc. fired Choi in April 2019 just a few weeks after the lawsuit was filed. Albano, a highly touted battery expert, left Fisker Inc. in May 2019, though Fisker Inc. contends he was fired in court filings. Albano has since filed a previously unreported breach of contract suit against Fisker Inc. in Los Angeles County Superior Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KxYnS"&gt;Since settling the trade secret lawsuit, both Fisker Inc. and QuantumScape have gone public and raised eye-popping amounts of money. Fisker Inc. went public in October 2020 &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/02/electric-vehicle-stocks-come-unplugged/"&gt;and raised $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s now planning to use more conventional lithium-ion batteries in its vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TvJDGW"&gt;QuantumScape went public in November 2020 and raised around $700 million in the process. In December, it published test results that showed its battery clearing key hurdles. QuantumScape’s CEO claimed to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that he thinks it is “the first to solve solid-state.” Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/volkswagen-sinks-another-200-million-into-solid-state-battery-company-quantumscape/"&gt;has said it hopes to put QuantumScape’s battery into production by 2025&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A court is forcing Valve to tell Apple how much money 436 different PC games made</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpkXCPEO1w3CLMq6sjASc7udQeE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875727/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqMUYh"&gt;Valve has been compelled by a California court to provide sales data on more than 400 Steam games to Apple and possibly reveal its yearly sales, revenue, and profits to Apple as well. The iPhone maker subpoenaed Valve for the data as part of its ongoing dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COCXIQ"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.356.0.pdf"&gt;to a Wednesday order by Judge Thomas Hixson&lt;/a&gt;, Valve will have to provide yearly sales and pricing data on 436 games that are available on both its PC game distribution platform, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. Apple has requested the data so it can define the video game market in its case against Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBOEl4"&gt;In a filing published on February 18th, Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291297/apple-valve-data-steam-sales-epic-games-dispute"&gt;had argued&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s demands were overly broad. Apple had asked for even more data in its subpoena, including annual revenues from Steam, the name of every app on Steam, and the date range for when those apps had been available. Valve argued that the demands would “impose an extraordinary burden” on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMvvZH"&gt;Valve has also been compelled to share “aggregated data” about how much it makes from Steam, though it’s not clear exactly what that will entail. Apple had asked for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ksuk20"&gt;RFP 2 asks for documents sufficient to show since 2008 Valve’s (a) total yearly sales from apps and in-app purchases from Steam, (b) annual advertising revenue attributable to Steam, (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam, (d) annual revenues from Steam, and (e) annual earnings, income or profits from Steam. Apple asks for this information by app if that is available. During meet and confer Apple limited the relevant time period to 2015 to the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eMV74O"&gt;In his ruling, Judge Hixson largely sided with Apple. “In the letter brief, Valve said this would be an overwhelming amount of work, but other than using adjectives, it did not substantiate or quantify the burden in any way,” Hixson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8vCx"&gt;“Apple has shown that it has a substantial need for this information to obtain evidence in support of its arguments concerning market definition and the effects of competition, and it cannot obtain this information elsewhere without undue burden,” he added. “Valve offers several reasons why Apple has not satisfied this standard, but none is persuasive.” Valve is the biggest PC game store in existence and generally doesn’t provide any sales data whatsoever, though you can find &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110?"&gt;simple unordered lists of the bestselling games&lt;/a&gt; each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9dLK4"&gt;Hixson did narrow the amount of information Valve has to provide. While Apple requested data dating back to 2015, Hixson ruled that Valve only needs to produce data from 2017 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTzUWa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;Epic sued Apple in August&lt;/a&gt; after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for introducing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that it says violated App Store rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Sb_6aZYKAVgUN-Mu726FoGJrQ=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643020/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh hey, it’s all of my PC games available to play on the Quest 2, wire-free, from within a virtual room. This is getting weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDDDh3"&gt;One of the best features of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn’t otherwise run natively on the headset. That’s great if you want a way to play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the obvious downside is that you’re now physically tethered to a PC — so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTupji"&gt;Thankfully, the developers at Virtual Desktop have already figured out the seemingly impossible: how to run system-intensive titles on your PC and stream the visual feed to your VR device while syncing all of your movements over Wi-Fi. It gives you the best of both worlds: letting you play the games you want without being attached by a cable to your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3KFeB"&gt;Doing this is now as simple as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying and installing a $20 app through the Oculus store&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t always so easy. There used to be several steps involved, but Virtual Desktop’s developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301151/oculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2"&gt;recently pushed an update&lt;/a&gt; that makes it considerably easier to stream your PC VR games via Wi-Fi. In short, the app can handle it natively instead of requiring a patch as a workaround. And with the latest update to this article, its length has been cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E0oS4h"&gt;Buy the Virtual Desktop app for Quest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qYkSF8"&gt;The Virtual Desktop app lets you access your PC through the lens of a VR headset. You can use it for games, like we’ll be doing, but you can also watch movies you have stored on your PC in a variety of different virtual environments. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;There’s a Quest-specific version of the app that you can purchase here for $20&lt;/a&gt;. (Make sure it says that it’s compatible with Quest underneath the purchase button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsBT4k"&gt;After you purchase it, install it on the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVvcJViGCifzUvXoqbandzJ1-6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220864/vd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop running on the Quest 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7F3xXK"&gt;Download Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zwiEFT"&gt;There’s yet one more application to download: &lt;a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/"&gt;Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free, and made by the same folks who made the Virtual Desktop app you purchased on the Quest 2. This app simply streams PC content to your headset via Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LRXQqT"&gt;Once this app is downloaded and installed, you’ll need to input your Oculus username in the Streamer window &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ovpydi"&gt;If you don’t know it off the top of your head, you can find it by opening the Oculus app on mobile, navigating to “Settings,” and then tapping on the area that shows your name and email address. The name that will display next to your avatar is your username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-J0UPjJSbyMOlAcOy2iyZNZhBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220804/oculusname.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having a hard time finding your Oculus username? Tap on your full name in the Settings menu to see this view pictured above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCc3Bu"&gt;After that’s entered, hit “Save”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RXWg5x"&gt;That’s the last step! But remember that it’s crucial to have the Virtual Desktop Streamer app open in order for your headset to communicate with your PC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop Streamer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFCk8sazQ5CJ39c4U4ARWJVRwXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220811/streamer.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Virtual Desktop Streamer app looks like. It’s very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FylPqj"&gt;Open Virtual Desktop on your Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFxMTY"&gt;You should see your PC pop up in the list of available devices to connect to from within the Virtual Desktop app on your Quest 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWDSZP"&gt;Once you’ve connected, the Options button (the left Touch controller’s equivalent of the Oculus button) is mapped to open up the top-level menu for Virtual Desktop, as shown in the image below. From there, clicking “Games” will reveal every game that’s installed on your PC. You can simply boot each one from there, and your PC will handle all of the hard work. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RetcNAlbbLJZGLVlASVqciHC1_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220812/virtudaldesktopgames.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the VR-ready games installed on your PC will show up within Virtual Desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4ucp4"&gt;If you aren’t happy with the visual fidelity within each game, you’re free to customize some settings that affect latency, refresh rate, and more. Note that you’ll likely get a clearer, more fluid image if your PC is powerful. Your wireless router plays a huge role in delivering a smooth experience, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNzjSC"&gt;Streaming VR over Wi-Fi certainly isn’t a perfect solution. I play just a few feet away from a Wi-Fi 6-ready router that’s wired directly to my PC via an ethernet switch, yet I still experience the occasional spot of lag and slightly fuzzy image. Though with enough tweaking on the Virtual Desktop app (turning Wi-Fi off on seldom-used tech items never hurts), I think you’ll have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zU1OZb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook is turning VR into a platform — but some indie devs fear its power","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ot7NCR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original article erroneously suggested that internet speed played a role in your ability to use this wireless solution to play your VR games. It’s all handled locally. Also, due to a malfunctioning USB-C port on the author’s PC, they erroneously stated that the USB-C cable included with each Quest 2 couldn’t be used to complete this how-to. A reader pointed out that it will work, and the author confirmed it by using the cable with an OTG adapter. We regret these errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
