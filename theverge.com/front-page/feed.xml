    <title>Epic v. Apple turns into Windows v. Xbox</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOxBbv"&gt;Is an iPhone more like a PC or an Xbox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSGTMc"&gt;That question was asked — implicitly and explicitly — over and over on the third day of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; testimony. The antitrust trial started on Monday with some heady pronunciations about &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;game and/or metaverse&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the case. Yesterday, both sides argued about whether iPhones and iPads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"&gt;were truly locked down&lt;/a&gt;. And today, Apple and Epic delved into one of the biggest questions of the trial: whether saying iOS violates antitrust law would make every major game console an unlawful monopoly too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOUsMk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says if Epic wins, ‘other ecosystems will fall’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nm7vev"&gt;Apple’s attorneys issued a dire warning to Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft during its opening statement, saying that their business models were all fundamentally similar. “If Epic prevails, other ecosystems will fall too,” they warned. But today, Epic called up Microsoft’s Xbox business development head Lori Wright as a sympathetic witness. In response to a line of questioning, Wright divided computing devices into “special-purpose” and “general-purpose” devices — in a way that clearly defined iPhones as the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrnw00"&gt;The Xbox, as Wright describes it, is a special-purpose device. “You are basically building a piece of hardware to do a specific thing,” she told a judge. “The Xbox is designed to give you a gaming experience. People buy an Xbox because they want to play games.” As a result, Microsoft keeps tight control of what content users can access — it’s a “curated, custom-built hardware/software experience.” The market is also much smaller: tens or hundreds of millions sold, compared to “billions” of Windows devices. Later in the day, Epic engineering fellow Andrew Grant gave his own, similar definition of gaming consoles in general, calling a console “a single-purpose device for entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R8kA1N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It can do a bunch of things already, and it has the aperture to do a bunch more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YaV4Py"&gt;Windows computers, according to Wright, are “general-purpose” devices. “You’re buying it to do a wide variety of things, and that changes every day as new ideas are getting created,” she said. “It can do a bunch of things already, and it has the aperture to do a bunch more things.” These platforms can support unexpected, emergent applications across more aspects of people’s lives, particularly when it’s easy to &lt;em&gt;get &lt;/em&gt;an app onto them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g0qLq"&gt;Wright made a point of discussing all the different ways that users could get apps on Windows. That includes Microsoft’s own app store, but also Steam, the Epic Games Store, and direct downloads from a website. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;recently dropped its commission on Windows apps&lt;/a&gt; to 12 percent to compete with Epic, while the Xbox still takes a 30 percent commission. Wright says there’s no plan to change that discrepancy. That’s despite the fact that under the hood, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/13/21020149/xbox-series-x-pc-specs-analysis"&gt;not a massive hardware difference&lt;/a&gt; between an Xbox and a desktop PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9c6yi"&gt;It’s hard to call the iPhone anything but a general-purpose device under Wright’s definition.  (She described a “special-purpose” Apple product as something like an iPod.) Intentionally or not, Wright also linked the distinction to one of Epic’s major talking points: profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Ps2EP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox head says the console is more like an iPod than an iPhone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hCoY1l"&gt;Epic describes profit as one of the biggest differences between iPhones and consoles. It argues console makers have to treat app makers better because they lose money on hardware, unlike Apple, so they need to plan around attracting developers to the platform. And from Microsoft’s point of view, Wright emphasized in testimony that no Xbox console has been sold at a profit, even late in a generation’s lifespan after manufacturing costs fall. So part of that curated hardware/software experience includes planning around a specific genre of app and attracting the developers who will build it, rather than simply turning it loose and seeing what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNDeo7"&gt;Microsoft later hedged in a statement saying that “profits are generated in game sales and online service subscriptions,” but it didn’t really contradict the claim — it just made clear, as Wright did, that the overall operation is profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnnCvu"&gt;Will these distinctions convince the court? It’s hard to say, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has asked questions that appear lightly skeptical of Epic’s hard lines between consoles and iPhones &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;Wright’s strict delineation of “general” and “specific” devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DtAVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You knew you were being dishonest, didn’t you?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68PLhS"&gt;Apple’s attorney didn’t spend as much time arguing over precise definitions. Apple’s strategy relied more on questioning Wright’s credibility by noting that she’d failed to produce documents that Apple requested. Later, an attorney similarly lambasted Grant for working on the hotfix that secretly introduced a new payment system into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, insisting that “you knew you were being dishonest, didn’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAzXo0"&gt;But Apple &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; push Wright to lay out in detail just &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;much more locked-down Xbox is than Windows, asking whether it did things like support rival game stores or streaming services. (This questioning was muddled by the fact that Microsoft refers to both its consoles &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;general gaming division as “Xbox,” so you can have an “Xbox store” on PC — a fact that led to some confusion during cross-examination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUAFA4"&gt;Why is this useful to Apple? Well, Epic began the trial by saying that iOS should work more like macOS. Both operating systems have a reputation for relative security and seamlessness, but only the latter allows installing software from outside the App Store. Epic’s opening statement questioned why Apple needed to lock down the iPhone when it had already created a perfectly workable but more open system. But with Wright and Microsoft, Apple has a perfect comparison point: a major computing company that offers two very different versions of a big black box.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google ‘arguably violated’ labor law by illegally firing three workers claims NLRB</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQfPB4e7p5CseoV4r9Y2imIKyss=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243937/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="load1x"&gt;The acting head of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said Google “arguably violated” US labor law by illegally firing three workers in 2019 amid their organizing activities, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-05/biden-labor-board-counsel-revives-google-illegal-firing-claims?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday, the NLRB reversed an earlier decision which had dismissed claims from Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers, and Paul Duke that Google had retaliated against them for labor activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9fYlBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The employees claim Google fired them to send a message&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyKYo3"&gt;The NLRB’s general counsel’s office has already accused Google of unlawfully terminating former Google workers Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers. Now, acting general counsel Peter Sung Ohr has asked that the complaint be amended to include Waldman, Rivers, and Duke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg2Ckv"&gt;Google claims that four employees, Berland, Waldman, Rivers, and Duke, were fired for violating data security policies; the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/11/25/20982649/google-fired-rebecca-rivers-employee-questioned-work-customs-and-border-protection"&gt;employees say that’s not true&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/3/20992786/google-workers-fired-nlrb-laurence-berland-rebecca-rivers-sophie-waldman-paul-duke"&gt;They argue&lt;/a&gt; the firings were retaliation for trying to organize in the workplace, and that Google terminated them to send a message to other employees. Rivers and Berland say that the documents they accessed weren’t sensitive, and that they were monitoring public calendar events. Spiers was fired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;for allegedly bypassing proper code submission procedures&lt;/a&gt; — she says she did a routine update to an internal system to remind employees of their labor rights. The trial is set to begin in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXo3eO"&gt;In a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “Our thorough investigation found the individuals were involved in systematic searches for other employees’ materials and work, including distributing confidential business and client information. As the hearing on these matters moves forward, we’re very confident in our decision and legal position.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX successfully landed a Starship prototype for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A rocket sitting on a concrete pad" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TTx2rZ1hnlIlcihVcKvFQKpRns=/0x48:1922x1329/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243586/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_6.32.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SN15 on the landing pad after landing  | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me94nM"&gt;SpaceX launched a high-altitude Starship prototype rocket and successfully landed it for the first time on Wednesday, overcoming a key challenge in Elon Musk’s whirlwind quest to build a fully reusable Mars rocket. Musk has said the SN15 rocket contained “hundreds of design improvements” over past high-altitude prototypes, which were all destroyed during explosive landing attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPQnNg"&gt;Starship SN15 lifted off at 6:24PM ET from SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities, soaring more than 6 miles in the sky to test in-flight maneuvers. As it reached peak altitude, SN15’s three Raptor engines gradually shut down to begin a horizontal free-fall back to Earth. Nearing land, two engines reignited to execute a complex “landing flip maneuver,” where the rocket reorients/repositions itself vertically ahead of a soft touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhAzgJ"&gt;The rocket deployed a set of tiny legs and landed firmly on a concrete pad not far from its launchpad, becoming the first surviving Starship prototype. A small fire appeared near the base of the rocket after landing — “not unusual with the methane fuel that we’re carrying,” SpaceX engineer John Insprucker said on the livestream — and was extinguished a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L35Ig2"&gt;“Starship landing nominal!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390073153347592192"&gt;Musk tweeted &lt;/a&gt;about seven minutes after SN15’s touchdown, declaring success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nmbbm0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starship landing nominal!&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390073153347592192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4GC1R"&gt;All four previous high-altitude prototypes exploded upon attempting to land — either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;shortly before&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311916/spacex-starship-prototype-landing-successful"&gt;moments after&lt;/a&gt; the touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCXlem"&gt;SpaceX’s Starship system is made for sending humans and up to 100 tons of cargo to the Moon and Mars. The 16-story-tall high-altitude prototypes like SN15 represent just the top half of Starship. The bottom half will be a towering “super-heavy” booster that will help launch Starship’s top half before returning back to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FCDko"&gt;The success at SpaceX’s so-called “Starbase” facilities in Texas on Wednesday follows a strong signal of approval from NASA, which last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;awarded Musk’s space company $2.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; to use Starship for the agency’s first two missions to the Moon by around 2024. Two other companies were in the running for the award: Blue Origin, which led a group of established space contractors including Lockheed Martin, and Dynetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOIp4d"&gt;SpaceX’s award shocked many in the space industry who expected NASA to pick two companies. Blue Origin and Dynetics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt; NASA’s decision, saying two companies should have been picked as expected and alleging the agency’s evaluation unfairly favored Starship. Those protests have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;put a hold&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX’s ability to use the $2.9 billion in funds, but development of Starship, supported largely by private funding and Musk’s wealth, has continued regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DvrfJ4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A busy two weeks for SpaceX&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oE01vo"&gt;“The past two weeks have been full of accomplishments by the SpaceX team,” Insprucker said after SN15’s clean touchdown, mentioning SpaceX’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398981/spacex-launches-third-nasa-astronaut-crew-used-crew-dragon-capsule"&gt;launch of astronauts&lt;/a&gt; on its used Crew Dragon capsule last month and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22413121/spacex-crew-dragon-resilience-splashdown-nasa-record-iss"&gt;first nighttime splashdown&lt;/a&gt; of a US astronaut capsule in 52 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjG3ku"&gt;For SpaceX and NASA’s two Moon missions, Starship will need to demonstrate it can refuel itself in orbit before flying to the lunar surface — two feats never before accomplished by a private company. The lunar version of Starship will also need to prove it can use an entirely different set of thrusters to ease itself down on the dusty surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A photographer says she was asked to work for Netflix’s Love is Blind — without any pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZAxNWLEHUbWrQ_Nhf6Gmq5zJtw=/471x0:2880x1606/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243762/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_3.18.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qP1nRB"&gt;Getting asked to shoot five weddings for a massively popular Netflix show might seem like a dream opportunity, but according to photographer Megan Saul, the show’s producers weren’t planing on paying for it. In &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/206802641/posts/10100694306153769/?d=n"&gt;a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; on May 4th, she says she was contacted by Kinetic Content (the company producing &lt;em&gt;Love Is Blind&lt;/em&gt; for Netflix) about working with them on the show, but was told in a follow-up email that, instead of money, the company was offering the opportunity for her work to appear in promotional materials and magazines (&lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/05/05/netflixs-love-is-blind-wants-unpaid-photographer-for-five-weddings/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PetaPixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyEvY6"&gt;In her post Saul says that getting the email was “super exciting for all of 20 minutes,” until she found out that she was being asked to basically donate her time and expertise. She called the request “insulting to artists,” calling on corporations to pay contractors and artists when they want work done. “Bottom line, this is offensive,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4D5Obi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting work in magazines and Netflix promos isn’t going to pay for gear, insurance, or employees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ySjmnd"&gt;Asking artists to work for free may be audacious, but common — there are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/forexposure_txt"&gt;entire Twitter accounts&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to companies and people asking for unpaid work with promises of “exposure,” or getting their work seen by others. Some people see this as an opportunity to get their name out, in the hope that a future paying client will see their work and contact them. Others say it undervalues artists’ work — would you ask an engineer to design a building for free because a lot of people might see it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXp7Jr"&gt;Regardless of where you fall in the debate, the producers are asking for &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. Shooting weddings is grueling, exhausting work and Kinetic Content is asking the photographer to do that &lt;em&gt;five times&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, as Saul points out in her Facebook post, getting her work in magazines and Netflix promos isn’t going to pay for her gear, insurance, or employees that she needs to help shoot a wedding. “It’s clearly more than my time I am donating for a major corporation to profit on my work,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiX6Fc"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;makes a lot of money&lt;/a&gt;, and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20813005/apple-tv-plus-original-video-spending-6-billion-the-morning-show-amazon-netflix-streaming-wars"&gt;a huge budget for producing content&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t know why Kinetic Content wanted free work, since neither Kinetic Content nor Netflix responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are the royals going to vlog?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4hjAa59jgcx2xVGIXoXxO3742Q=/227x0:2651x1616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243414/williamkatevlog.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0s0rf"&gt;The young attractive royal couple that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Harry and Meghan has dropped a truly chaotic intro video for their shiny new official YouTube channel. In the video, the presumed future queen and king of the United Kingdom (also known as Kate Middleton and Kate Middleton’s husband) laugh and chat awkwardly in what looks like their home. It’s well-lit but not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;well-lit: a reasonably good YouTuber rig but not exactly one of royal magnificence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apz9rO"&gt;“Be careful what you’re saying, these guys are going to start filming,” says Prince William to his smiling wife, as though she doesn’t know how cameras work. The general feel of the clip is the first few seconds after a camera starts rolling but before the YouTube stars start vlogging in earnest. Except they don’t vlog. The video then cuts to what can only be described as a hype reel of public appearances at public functions or at their various charities — not exactly an exclusive glimpse of the royals at home. Where is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Where are the chickens?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hiV7oo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What is this new channel even for?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YE3MjR"&gt;It’s not as though Will and Kate’s new channel is going to be a royal pioneer in the world of awkward webcam recordings with dubious production values. For one thing, it looks like they’ve invested in an actual setup. For another thing, the British royal family — as an official, monolithic institution — has had a YouTube channel since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/dec/23/youtube.monarchy"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. And for the past year, while much of the world has been in lockdown, the channel has become replete with recordings of Zoom meetings. From such bangers as “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge host bingo” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_6tCpOllPw&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;100K views&lt;/a&gt;) to less inspired videos like “The Earl of Wessex joins a video call with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQaEOEz780&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;4.8K views&lt;/a&gt;), the House of Windsor has been very busy addressing the masses from their laptops, at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i1X4Z"&gt;So will the Cambridges vlog or won’t they? What is this new channel even for? And what’s the deal with their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/style/meghan-markle-instagram.html"&gt;weird Instagram follower count&lt;/a&gt;, anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7biSAY"&gt;It’s impossible not to connect this latest foray into the world of #creator #platforms with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;bombshell interview&lt;/a&gt; with Oprah or to contrast it with that other couple’s deals with Netflix and Spotify. The &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/kate-middleton-meghan-markle-fighting-drama-rumors.html"&gt;supposed bad blood&lt;/a&gt; between the princes and their wives might be more tabloid projection than reality, but it’s at least true that one couple is set to one day succeed to the throne, while the other has dealt the British monarchy a blow as severe as the &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/11/princess-diana-martin-bashir-interview"&gt;1995 Princess Diana interview&lt;/a&gt; with Martin Bashir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SmL5t0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CYICv"&gt;Is the new Will and Kate YouTube channel a response to the burgeoning Harry / Meghan media empire? Is it a bid for independence from the British tabloid press? Or is it just the Kensington Palace comms team trying out something new that will wind up just as anodyne and dull as the rest of the royal family’s internet presence? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfTNmw"&gt;In truth, it’s bizarre that the British royal family is just barely keeping up with the newest changes in the media landscape. A dysfunctional rich family whose sole purpose in life is to be famous? The Windsors were influencers before they were &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britains-king-george-v-changes-royal-surname"&gt;called the Windsors&lt;/a&gt; and long before being an influencer was even a thing. How is their entire brand still in the grip of the tabloids? It’s like the royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stIJ7d"&gt;Of course, previous attempts at the “Royals: They’re Just Like Us” narrative have been met with mixed results. On the one hand, these behind-the-scenes-type video treatments have always done gangbusters in television ratings. On the other hand, the family has uniformly hated and despised these documentaries, like the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/uk/royal-family-1969-documentary-youtube-scli-gbr-intl/index.html"&gt;hilariously awkward 1969 BBC documentary&lt;/a&gt; depicting the everyday life of the royals, which is rumored to have been banned by the queen, though not until after approximately 350 million people viewed it worldwide. (The documentary made its way onto YouTube earlier this year and was quickly taken down via copyright notice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YlyY01"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CiTCy"&gt;Then there’s the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/world/prince-charles-in-tv-documentary-admits-to-infidelity.html"&gt;1994 ITV documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Prince Charles (you know, the one who married Diana) that was so disastrous for his image that a subsequent poll by &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; found that two-thirds of respondents did not want Charles to succeed as the next king. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmTwk2"&gt;Will and Kate’s request for people to like and subscribe is the latest in a weighty media legacy spanning from Edward VIII’s abdication radio broadcast to Elizabeth II’s televised coronation to the tabloid warfare that Prince William’s own parents waged against each other before his mother’s untimely death while chased by paparazzi looking to feed the content mill. Given this history, it’s understandable why the couple’s online presence in all things is so tightly controlled. However, restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success, and the royal family’s reticence and general fear of candor is exactly one of the reasons why the Meghan / Harry and Oprah interview was such a wild success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RURbq1"&gt;But who’s to say how things will turn out after all? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are, essentially, taxpayer-funded celebrities. Surely, they’ve put more thought into this than we have. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s next big Switch title is aimed at budding game designers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UxDzxzoZsqdfJbgHgr5RjDPmcIY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243321/Switch_GameBuilderGarage_MysteryCode_SCRN_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAf8Xr"&gt;Nintendo’s next game for the Switch is one you build yourself. Today the company revealed &lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt;, a new software title that’s designed to teach beginners the basics of programming and game design. It utilizes visual programming, has pre-built lessons and games, and will be launching on the Switch next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="i5OHRA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9280993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OcyzE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt; appears to build off of some of the ideas featured in past Nintendo projects, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy"&gt;the DIY series of Labo experiences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758773/super-mario-maker-2-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The core of the experience is a playful, visual programming language that utilizes cute characters called Nodon that you can move around and assign properties to. For instance, once you insert a character node, you can attach a “stick” node and assign the Switch’s joystick to control left and right movement. (Nintendo says that there are dozens of these Nodon, each with different characteristics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8tEb2"&gt;And just like in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;, players can quickly move back and forth between building and playing in order to rapidly iterate on ideas. The app also features several different control options: Joycon controllers, touchscreen, or a USB mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYPHtT"&gt;The other half of the equation is the “Lesson Mode.” &lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt; comes with seven pre-made games — they range from a 3D platformer to a multiplayer game of tag to a side-scrolling shooter — and the tutorial takes you through how they were built, so you can see the process from scratch. Each of the games is broken down into several steps, starting with basic concepts like movement, before moving on to more complex design features like adding a counter or game-over screen. Outside of those seven games, there’s a “free programming” mode, where players can build whatever they want. This mode is also available from the beginning if you don’t want to go through the built-in lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RiE8q5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Learn to make games from the minds at Nintendo! Build your own games from the ground up with the colorful and quirky Nodon when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameBuilderGarage?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GameBuilderGarage&lt;/a&gt; comes to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt; on June 11!&lt;a href="https://t.co/OLw5XSTAMs"&gt;https://t.co/OLw5XSTAMs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1A5ovEc5ZM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1A5ovEc5ZM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1390064521885147137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agk1Av"&gt;Naturally, players will also be able to share their creations via a code that can be sent to other players. (Nintendo says that there will be an option to report inappropriate games, particularly given &lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt;’s younger target audience.) In order to share their creations, players will need a Nintendo Switch Online connection. Once you download someone else’s game, you’ll not only be able to play it but also look at the programming view to see how it was designed. You can even make a copy to build on top of another player’s creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXttjQ"&gt;Over the last few years, Nintendo has steadily been putting a bigger focus on building user-friendly creation tools and bringing them to a wider audience. In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11327140/nintendo-super-mario-maker-education-sfpl"&gt;the company partnered with the San Francisco Public Library&lt;/a&gt; to host a series of game design lessons via &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18009754/nintendo-labo-teacher-guide-educational-school"&gt;in 2018 it launched a pilot program to bring Labo to schools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04Ziz8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt; will be available on June 11th for $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US supports lifting patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwAV-GUkSkniJdZ1apjkePPbYZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243052/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Dow9F"&gt;The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it supported waiving patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines, calling the pandemic a “global health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NMjXi"&gt;“This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures. The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines,” United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves/status/1390023314211491841"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxUgQZ"&gt;Waiving those protections would theoretically let countries and organizations manufacture patented vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.msf.org/countries-obstructing-covid-19-patent-waiver-must-allow-negotiations"&gt;without facing repercussions&lt;/a&gt;. But they would need to have the expertise and materials on hand to actually produce the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xi7IE"&gt;India and South Africa had &lt;a href="https://pop-umbrella.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/e9989bf5-7d26-4d4d-8336-8d37f1577529_W669.pdf?key="&gt;previously proposed&lt;/a&gt; that the World Trade Organization (WTO) suspend certain intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments in an effort to ramp up production and distribute vaccines more widely. That effort, which started last October, was blocked by a small number of countries, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/covid-rich-countries-are-refusing-to-waive-ip-rights-on-vaccines.html"&gt;including the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2rc8"&gt;India and South Africa are now &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-south-africa-to-make-fresh-push-for-waiver-of-vaccine-patents-at-wto-101619886294125.html"&gt;making a renewed push&lt;/a&gt; for waivers at the WTO, and this time, the effort will have US support. Tai pledged that the US would actively negotiate at the WTO to make waivers happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruR8Z3"&gt;“As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts – working with the private sector and all possible partners – to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines,” Tai said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGjcP1"&gt;While the US has secured &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/02/11/biden-administration-purchases-additional-doses-covid-19-vaccines-from-pfizer-and-moderna.html"&gt;hundreds of millions of doses&lt;/a&gt; of various vaccines, other countries have struggled to purchase and produce enough vaccines for their populations. The US has fully vaccinated more than &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;32 percent of its population&lt;/a&gt;. India, which is currently wrestling with a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-covid-19-crisis-raises-pressure-to-waive-vaccine-patents-11619861401"&gt;horrific surge in cases&lt;/a&gt;, has fully vaccinated just 2.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0C3SM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is ruining the open for a surprise meme with better image crops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axYvoP9lpdByAfm1wRmIGL2GUxA=/123x27:1050x645/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69242684/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_1.07.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqVj2Q"&gt;Twitter is finally rolling out a long-awaited feature: bigger images that don’t crop in so darn much. Now, image previews should show way more of the image, giving you a better idea of what you’re actually looking at, and avoiding embarrassing situations where Twitter’s cropping algorithm picks the absolute wrong thing to focus on (sometimes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1307440596668182528%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323298%2Ftwitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;with apparent racial bias&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nk7Imr"&gt;Twitter announced it would be testing the improvement on iOS and Android &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt;, and it should now be making its way to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OqrVNE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;no bird too tall, no crop too short&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;introducing bigger and better images on iOS and Android, now available to everyone &lt;a href="https://t.co/2buHfhfRAx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2buHfhfRAx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1390026628957417473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3pBqOu"&gt;Those pictures should also be clearer, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396245/twitter-4k-images-photos-android-ios-apps-update"&gt;Twitter’s recent update to 4K images&lt;/a&gt; — because some art just needs to be seen as clear as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CmaKwW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New twitter crop dropped, it's Dinopost time &lt;a href="https://t.co/bbRL6VMhNU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bbRL6VMhNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1390035095302467584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C95G5z"&gt;Of course, Twitter giveth and Twitter taketh away — the change will, for the most part, make the “open for a surprise” tweets not so surprising. I suppose it’s a fair trade-off to avoid the sometimes wildly embarrassing crops that used to plague the platform. (Or at least it is for me, someone who follows a ton of artists and is tired of scrolling past poorly cropped drawings that actually end up being really good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pCKXv"&gt;And hey, if you want to see those memes, it seems like the web version of Twitter on desktops is still susceptible. Hide on, tiny cat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncQozM"&gt;An old version of Peloton’s API, the software that allows the company’s bikes and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalled treadmills&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with its servers, may have exposed private customer profiles, according to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The bug was first spotted by Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, and reported to Peloton on January 20th, but the company is only just now confirming that the bug has been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuZLzG"&gt;Using Peloton’s API, Masters was able to scrape all sorts of customer information that would typically be private, depending on the individual user’s settings. That includes customer profiles, which can potentially feature their age, location, birthday, and workout history. All Masters had to do was make an unauthenticated request to Peloton’s API and customer data was his. Masters has a more thorough explanation of how the exploit worked &lt;a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000"&gt;on Pen Test Partners’ blog&lt;/a&gt; and also summarized his findings in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEKwp2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMgvMajthkI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="75le1b"&gt;After reporting the bug to Peloton, Masters set a 90-day deadline to address the issue. That deadline came and went without Peloton saying whether the API was fixed, which prompted Masters to turn to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. Peloton finally responded and shared the following statement with the publication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iTuetT"&gt;It’s a priority for Peloton to keep our platform secure and we’re always looking to improve our approach and process for working with the external security community. Through our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure program, a security researcher informed us that he was able to access our API and see information that’s available on a Peloton profile. We took action, and addressed the issues based on his initial submissions, but we were slow to update the researcher about our remediation efforts. Going forward, we will do better to work collaboratively with the security research community and respond more promptly when vulnerabilities are reported. We want to thank Ken Munro for submitting his reports through our CVD program and for being open to working with us to resolve these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dWdC3P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15408338/bike-peloton-review-indoor-cycle-live-streaming-cycling"&gt;The screens on Peloton’s bikes&lt;/a&gt; and treadmills are what make the company’s workout ways so compelling. It’s how subscribers attend classes, track their workouts, and even do other non-bike or treadmill exercises. It’s a feature that Peloton charges $39 per month for an all-access membership to. Yet, like all connected devices, particularly fitness ones, it can leave private customer information more vulnerable than a non-connected stationary bike would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSNrpr"&gt;Masters writes that Peloton apologized and said it resolved a majority of the API issues within a week of his report. What’s not immediately clear is if anyone other than Masters gained access to customer data while the API was in a leaky state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p86hZq"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;followed up to check&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Peloton said it had nothing new to share that it hadn’t already provided &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; and Pen Test Partners. The company also reiterated it responded to the API issue immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsxuNt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon wants to make sure drivers who don’t work for the company are well-groomed and nice online</title>

  &lt;p id="5ZrK3F"&gt;Amazon is infamous for tightly controlling its workers and contractors, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-05/amazon-work-rules-govern-tweets-body-odor-of-contract-drivers"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that it also tries to control the employees of companies that it contracts. The company has explicit policies concerning personal grooming and social media etiquette that apply to the drivers from other delivery companies. The rules govern everything from how the delivery people look (they must have clean fingernails, teeth, ears, and hair) to how they smell (no bad breath, body odor, or immodest perfume). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHHUeG"&gt;The rules also apparently forbid drivers from making social media posts that could be considered obscene. That by itself wouldn’t be remarkable, but it’s worth noting that these policies are applied to drivers that don’t work for Amazon, and so reach much further than the company’s official employee base. The drivers are instead employees of local delivery companies that are contracted by Amazon through its Delivery Service Partners program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhY8Xh"&gt;The workers for these companies are the same ones affected &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347945/amazon-delivery-drivers-ai-surveillance-cameras-vans-consent-form"&gt;by the company’s AI-powered cameras&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers have to consent to always-on cameras monitoring them for things like distracted driving or traffic violations if they want to work (or keep working) by delivering packages for the retail giant. Amazon’s plan to install the cameras was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;discovered through a video&lt;/a&gt; where an Amazon manager explained the partnership between the company and the camera manufacturer. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; has since discovered driver consent forms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAa5JQ"&gt;Amazon is well-known for not giving its employees (or those who work under its umbrella) much leeway when it comes to handling their personal lives — many warehouse employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892693/amazon-protest-time-off-part-time-workers-sacramento-fired"&gt;have to micromanage their time away from work&lt;/a&gt; to avoid being fired, and the company allegedly constantly texted employees during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;the recent Alabama union drive&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon’s leadership, including Jeff Bezos, has claimed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385762/bezos-letter-shareholders-amazon-workers-union-bessemer-workplace"&gt;doesn’t treat its employees like robots&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s hard to look at rules like this for drivers who aren’t even contractors and believe that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWfxyP"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
