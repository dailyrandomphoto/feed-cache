    <title>Microsoft to end Windows 10 support on October 14th, 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bhb6kCBxm4HB7OUFuf5adZ3XCFo=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449073/windowslogo_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="chG9SQ"&gt;Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 on October 14th, 2025. It will mark just over 10 years since the operating system was first introduced. Microsoft revealed the retirement date for Windows 10 in an updated &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro"&gt;support life cycle page&lt;/a&gt; for the OS. &lt;a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/251736/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thurrott&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that this is the first time Microsoft has ever described the end of support for Windows 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajzah0"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when the support document was updated, but &lt;em&gt;Thurrott&lt;/em&gt; reports it only previous documented “when specific Windows 10 versions would leave support,” and not the entire OS. It could be another hint that a new version of Windows is on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DnZw65"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft keeps dropping Windows 11 hints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7bFXyG"&gt;Microsoft has been dropping lots of hints that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;ready to launch Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. The software maker is holding a special Windows event to reveal the “next generation” of the OS next week. The event starts at 11AM ET, and the event invite includes a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks like the number 11. Microsoft execs have also been teasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;“next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt; for months, and one even described it as a “new version of Windows” recently. Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528115/microsoft-windows-11-startup-sound-new-teaser-video"&gt;teased Windows 11 during an 11-minute video&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0cwxe"&gt;We’re expecting Microsoft to announce a new version of Windows with significant user interface changes, and an overhaul to the Windows Store. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed “Sun Valley,” which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.” There will be many other changes, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;read our previous coverage for what to expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_SH6v9iEEDYwVrtRSrlYFtbWGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495503/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re expecting to see a new version of Windows soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YhQCiN"&gt;Microsoft originally committed to 10 years of support for Windows 10, with an original mainstream end of support date set for October 13th, 2020. That mainstream end of support has not yet commenced, as Microsoft has been introducing regular updates and extending active Windows 10 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsFc2I"&gt;We’re still not in the extended support phase of Windows 10 yet, which is the period when Microsoft doesn’t add new features to an operating system and simply maintains support with bug fixes and security patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGT8NG"&gt;Windows 10 has been an unusual release for Microsoft, as it moved away from its typical cadence of releasing a new version of the OS every few years. Instead, Microsoft moved Windows to more of a service, updating it twice a year with new features. Microsoft may have described Windows 10 as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;the last version of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” but it has now been nearly six years since its release and Microsoft looks ready to move on to something new.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon wants you vaccinated, so here’s $180 AirPods Pro and other accessory discounts  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-ZJMAVDO75nkdN07lIyy9_DAPc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448997/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7IgN6"&gt;Verizon is joining &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/today-the-first-winners-of-washington-states-covid-vaccine-lottery-will-be-chosen/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/media-center/odh-news-releases/odh-news-release-05-28-21"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; in offering a financial incentive to get the COVID vaccine: its customers who have gotten at least one dose can get a 10 percent discount on accessories, from either its online or physical stores. To sweeten the deal even more, Verizon is letting customers stack that discount on top of sale prices, which can be used to get some pretty solid deals. It’s unclear if or how you’ll have to prove your vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbanD"&gt;For example, Verizon has the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/apple-airpods-pro-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro on sale&lt;/a&gt; until June 20th, and the 10 percent discount brings them down to $180 from their normal price of $250. If you’re more a fan of headphones and can snag the discount, you’ll be able to pick up Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;delightfully named WH-1000XM4s&lt;/a&gt; for $270. The offer could also be a way to get a nice little discount on a lower-priced item you’ve been considering, like a Samsung wireless charging pad or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/anker-soundcore-liberty-air-2-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIShJB"&gt;The offer is also valid for first responders, nurses, teachers, and military members. Any customers who are eligible will have from June 15th to July 31st, 2021 to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/discounts/vaccination/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fill out a questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; and receive their promo code, which can be redeemed until August 15th. While accessories that are on sale can be discounted, Verizon says that, for whatever reason, accessories whose prices end with a .97 can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3HiJf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors CEO resigns after investigation into preorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Tours New Lordstown Endurance Electric Pickup Truck" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2B8-WIXRczI5bVD_6XOAyyo9CLU=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448950/1228771026.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zAyIMY"&gt;Steve Burns, the CEO of General Motors-backed startup Lordstown Motors, has resigned following an investigation into allegations that he and other executives lied about preorders for the company’s electric pickup truck. The startup’s chief financial officer Julio Rodriguez has also resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1Pfh3"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation"&gt;investigation found&lt;/a&gt; that while Lordstown Motors said on multiple occasions that a majority of the 100,000 non-binding preorders it collected were from commercial fleets, this was not the case. It also discovered that “one entity that provided a large number of pre-orders does not appear to have the resources to complete large purchases of trucks,” and that other companies on the list “provided commitments that appear too vague or infirm to be appropriately included in the total number of pre-orders disclosed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUJEUb"&gt;“We thank Steve Burns for his passion and commitment to the company,” the startup said in a statement. Burns will be temporarily replaced by Angela Strand, who is an independent board member at Lordstown Motors, though she formerly worked at Burns’ previous EV startup, Workhorse. Becky Roof, a certified public accountant and former CFO, will temporarily replace Rodriguez. “We have complete confidence in Angela and Becky, and our expanded leadership team, to effectively guide the company during this interim period,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh52Vl"&gt;The probe, which was conducted by law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, was launched in March after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; that made a number of allegations of potential wrongdoing at Lordstown Motors. At the heart of the report was Hindenburg’s belief that the EV startup had misled investors about the viability of preorders it touted in late 2020 and early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2w3er9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lordstown Motors wants to avoid the ‘carnage’ of failed EV startups","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"},{"title":"Lordstown Motors probed by SEC for allegedly misleading investors","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WIQTmz"&gt;The research firm made other claims about Lordstown Motors’ progress on its electric pickup truck, and also discovered that one of the startup’s prototypes had caught fire. The law firm says that these other parts of the report are “in significant respects, false and misleading,” and that “the viability of Lordstown Motors’ technology and timeline to start of production are not accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PwwCkv"&gt;Lordstown Motors is also facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that was opened following Hindenburg’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8jhvP"&gt;Founded in 2019 by Burns, Lordstown Motors bought a recently shuttered GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio in a deal that then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"&gt;billed as “GREAT NEWS” for the state&lt;/a&gt;. Trump had been putting pressure on GM to do something with the factory, and his administration celebrated the transaction and Lordstown Motors as a result. Lordstown Motors brought the truck to the White House for &lt;a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/09/trump-shows-off-lordstown-motors-pickup-truck-at-white-house-on-the-eve-of-cleveland-presidential-debate.html"&gt;an event in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and then-VP Mike Pence attended the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;reveal of the Endurance pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; a few months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vytht5"&gt;The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;went public late last year&lt;/a&gt; and raised $675 million in the process. GM was one of the highest-profile investors and has a seat on the board of the startup. GM was also involved in another EV startup, Nikola, that Hindenburg Research published a report about. That company also juggled its leadership and is currently under investigation from the SEC and the DOJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Oj32F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Novavax says its COVID-19 vaccine is 90 percent effective </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Novavax Vaccine Appears Effective Against UK Coronavirus Variant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GdfGBCXomr8ec9ZvC-rNIRCsauk=/389x0:5566x3451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448930/1231469378.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HgCDwP"&gt;The two-shot COVID-19 vaccine made by Novavax is 90 percent effective against the disease, the company &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-90-overall-efficacy-and"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AeAZr"&gt;The Novavax shots are a different type of vaccine than the ones already available: it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;protein-based vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that directly delivers bits of the coronavirus spike protein, which the body then makes antibodies against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCHQSc"&gt;Novavax tested its vaccine in 29,960 people across the US and Mexico who were randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or a placebo injection. There were 77 cases of COVID-19 in the study: 14 in people who’d received the vaccine, and 63 in the group that got a placebo. All 14 cases in the vaccine group were mild. In the placebo group, ten cases were moderate and four were severe, showing the shots protect against more serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSG8vY"&gt;The trial ran when the Alpha coronavirus variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, was widespread in the US. The results confirm that the shots protect against that form of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIscWl"&gt;The results are similar to those from the clinical trial Novavax &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3"&gt;ran in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the shots were around 89 percent effective. That trial was also run at a time when the Alpha variant was widespread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFsaZW"&gt;The US has already authorized three COVID-19 vaccines and has secured enough of those vaccines to vaccinate the entire population of the US. Still, Novavax says it plans to submit its vaccine to regulators in the US and around the world by this fall. By that point, the US regulatory agency, the Food and Drug Administration, may have already granted full approval to the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHSjce"&gt;If the FDA does approve any vaccines, Novavax may not be able to apply for the speedier emergency authorization process that the other three vaccines went through — that process is technically only open if there are no fully approved products to treat a condition. However, because Novavax has already been in discussions with the FDA, it may still be able to go that route, Stanley Erck, the company’s CEO, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/health/covid-vaccine-novavax.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkzezR"&gt;Novavax had &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/05/10/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine/"&gt;manufacturing problems&lt;/a&gt; this spring that forced it to push back estimates for when it could file for regulatory clearance and provide vaccines. The company has an agreement with the COVAX initiative, which is securing vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, for &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-gavi-execute-advance-purchase-agreement-covid-19"&gt;1.1 billion doses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SCPq6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go creator Niantic is making a Transformers game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Np5Aslv9jpJ9fKBHo3dHAiEPf84=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448765/hm_bumblebee_concept_updated.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1wPQlY"&gt;Niantic is expanding from cute critters to giant robots. Today, the game developer announced its next project: a location-based augmented reality game called &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt;. The game is expected to launch globally this year, with a soft launch in select countries “soon.” Niantic says that it has partnered with Seattle-based studio Very Very Spaceship, which will be leading development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsnYit"&gt;You might be wondering just how towering transforming robots will translate to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;-style gameplay. Here’s the basic description from Niantic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9kbMBM"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Heavy Metal&lt;/em&gt;, players will join the Guardian Network, a group of humans who have banded together with the Autobots in a war against the Decepticons. As a Guardian, players will uncover hidden regions across Earth to find resources and battle Decepticons in turn-based battles, either solo or with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P81dnE"&gt;While Niantic is best-known for the ongoing success of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the company has also expanded by attempting to bring other fictional realms to video games. The first was the Harry Potter universe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345472/niantic-nintendo-pikmin-partnership-collaboration-ar-mobile-game"&gt;the developer announced a partnership with Nintendo that will include a &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Future Apple Watches could feature blood glucose and body temperature sensors</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6, released last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h8ahct"&gt;This year’s Apple Watch could feature an improved screen and updated ultra-wideband support, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, but more substantial improvements like temperature and blood glucose monitoring will not appear until later models. The company is also reportedly planning a successor to last year’s more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a new extreme sports-focused model, due for release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBxl32"&gt;The improvements coming to this year’s model, which will almost certainly be called the Series 7, appear to be small. Its display bezels are said to be thinner, and a new lamination  technique could reduce the distance between the display and the front cover. The watch’s ultra-wideband support could also be improved after getting its Apple wearable debut in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;last year’s Series 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NyDWvI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An extreme sports-focused model may not launch until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JTZ00W"&gt;But the years ahead could bring more substantial improvements for Apple’s wearable. Top of the list is a new blood glucose monitoring feature, which could automatically log blood-sugar levels for diabetics without them needing to prick a finger to draw blood. There’s also reportedly a new body temperature monitoring feature on the way, which has reportedly seen a surge in interest due to the pandemic. The temperature sensor could appear in the watch’s 2022 refresh, while blood glucose monitoring is several years away, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyFkFe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was internally discussing releasing a rugged smartwatch aimed at extreme sports users. It now reports this model, internally referred to as an “explorer” or “adventure” edition, is unlikely to release this year, and could arrive in 2022. However &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;cautions that this, like all of Apple’s unannounced plans, are subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s premium G1 OLED now comes with a 5-year warranty in the US and UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pU-sbNp7Kjiwl0jQpwSNgkvLaK4=/4x0:1597x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448531/large01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG is now offering a 5-year warranty for its G1 OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bu8FhG"&gt;LG is offering an extended 5-year warranty on its 4K G1 OLED in the US, covering any problems that develop with its panel after the standard one-year warranty. In the UK &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fuk%2Foled-tvs%2F2021%2Foled-warranty&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F14%2F22532894%2Flg-5-year-warranty-g1-oled-z1-4k-8k-usa-panel-failure-burn-in" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; the extended warranty also applies to its Z1 8K OLED. It’s unclear in how many other countries LG is offering the extended warranty, and the company did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6jAqo"&gt;The extended warranty appears to be an attempt to upsell customers from LG’s popular lower-end sets like the C1 to its more premium G1 model. But it should also allay any fears that the new brighter Evo OLED panel LG is using in the G1 won’t last as long as its previous OLED panels. Or, as LG said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/lg-oled-tvs-now-come-with-a-five-year-warranty-but-not-all-of-them"&gt;given to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “The warranty is designed to offer peace of mind to customers purchasing our flagship, more expensive OLED models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6LwlxJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LG’s cheaper C1 OLED is not included&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="faT6Yg"&gt;Of course, the big question is whether the extended warranty covers permanent image retention, aka “burn-in,” where parts of an image can remain visible after being displayed for an extended period. In response to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-extends-2021-g1-oled-warranty-five-years-175840084.html?src=rss_b2c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;’s question&lt;/a&gt; about this, LG gave this evasive response: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="T8dkWo"&gt;“LG’s five-year limited warranty program is in line with the company’s consistent communication regarding the low risk of image retention on LG OLED TVs, when used in normal viewing conditions… As with any self-emitting display, OLED TVs may experience temporary image retention under certain conditions, but permanent image retention, or burn-in, is rare under normal viewing conditions. Image retention is not a product defect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bLHUhU"&gt;The implication seems to be that temporary image retention is normal and is nothing to worry about, but all LG will say about permanent image retention is that it’s “rare.” Meanwhile, in a statement given &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b09oXig-4wk"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;HDTVTest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the company said the warranty covers “any image issues,” so long as the display is being used normally, and not in a commercial setting where static images might be left onscreen for far longer (the famous example of this is a &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-switches-airport-oled-to-lcd-amid-burn-in-row/"&gt;South Korean airport&lt;/a&gt; which had to swap out the OLED TVs it was using to show departure times). We’ve contacted LG to try and get a simple yes or no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik4d7v"&gt;Like other warranties, LG’s also comes with various exceptions, such as damage caused by power surges, acts of nature, or improper installation. But LG’s warranty should still provide some assurance that you’ll get a decent few years of use if you splash out on one of its more expensive TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml1IBI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwFSZD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Workspace and Google Chat are officially available to everybody</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Spaces" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rtFVBU9LrXneTbHJCVe24eCBXmU=/120x0:3720x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448465/Spaces_static_image___Fam_Reunion.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1st3n"&gt;Google is announcing some changes to its Workspace suite of apps and services today, including availability for anybody who has a Google account. Google says that there are over three billion users of its Workspace apps — though it’s probably a safe bet that Gmail accounts for a healthy chunk of that userbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oeUWT"&gt;A lot of people will soon have the option to switch over to Google’s more modern system for Gmail, Docs, and Chat. All of them can be integrated in a single tab more easily, for example with chats sliding over to the left to reveal a shared spreadsheet. It’s also related to the company’s new “smart canvas” push, which is also designed to interlink its various apps via “smart chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYHrm5"&gt;To get started, Google is now officially offering the setting to turn on Google Chat to all users. It’s a new &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9341104"&gt;setting within Gmail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9O0d1"&gt;With the switch, Google Chat messaging should be an option for all now, which can include direct messages and chat Rooms. But Google is also introducing a new terminology to go along with the announcement. It is announcing the “evolution of Rooms in Google Chat to Spaces.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK5iBL"&gt;A Space is essentially the same thing as a chat Room, but Google wants to separate them out into their own top-level form of communication next to Gmail, Chat, and Meet. Google is layering on a few new features like improved message threading, more emoji reactions, user roles, moderation tools, and “discoverable” spaces. In that sense, it seems that Spaces wants to serve both as a Slack competitor and as a competitor for public Discord groups and, well, maybe as an optional replacement for email groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmv8yP"&gt;It’s a little confusing — but that’s par for the course for Google’s messaging strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Spaces" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/alXb9CFIhX8gZDgkgIR-zD0gkSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22656698/Spaces_static_image___Fam_Reunion.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Spaces&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hT9DIK"&gt;The key idea, according to Sanaz Ahari, senior director of product, is that users can more easily switch between “modalities” of communication. The intent is to “keep the context,” Ahari says. “If you start something with an email and then you want to upgrade it into more real-time interaction between a group — or even for a project — you’re able to do that and you can keep the context. Then you can all seamlessly upgrade into a meeting at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpDFhJ"&gt;Google is promising it will “launch a streamlined and flexible user interface” for Spaces this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbX1x9"&gt;Those aren’t the only announcements getting bundled into today’s Workspace news. The company is launching a new tier called “Google Workspace Individual” at $9.99 per month, which gives users more Workspace tools without requiring them to set up their own domain or custom email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82XYBg"&gt;When Workspace users say yes to a meeting, they will be able to indicate whether they’ll be attending remotely or in the reserved meeting room. Google also provided a date for the Companion Mode feature, which encourages people in the meeting room to also turn on their cameras so that remote workers don’t feel quite as left out — it should be coming in September to desktop and “soon” to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ECXaW"&gt;Google also snuck in an announcement that it will &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; offer a progressive web app for Google Workspace in September. In theory, it could make it much easier for Gmail users to have their email and other Google apps feel more like actual desktop apps and not just tabs in the browser. That’s possible now via various Electron apps and Single Site Browser windows, but it requires more work than it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOgC9E"&gt;Finally, Google is adding enterprise options that are going to be necessary if it really wants to have a shot at going after larger companies. Corporations will be able to use their own client-side encryption for data, add more “trust rules” for various Drive files to simplify access and permissions, and label files based on their sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4R80y"&gt;Google Workspace has been rapidly updating and iterating over the past few months, a sign perhaps that the company really does intend to seriously compete with Microsoft. Google’s strategy goes beyond just improving its products — it’s more tightly integrating them together. Gmail users will soon find more prompts than ever to bring them into Google’s other Workspace products — and some no doubt will be looking for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut"&gt;ways to avoid all that&lt;/a&gt;. Putting buttons for Chat, Meet, and Rooms (soon to be Spaces) at the bottom of the most popular email app in the world is sure to raise usage — and potentially some antitrust eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nNJa6"&gt;The biggest question mark is whether Google can coherently explain the switchover to Chat, why it’s worth it, and what this new Spaces thing really is. Now that Workspace is going to be available to over three billion regular people, the company is going to need to work hard to clearly communicate with all of them.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s game streaming service Luna is opening access to all Prime members June 21 and 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqBmj6HQn-51xq9r_A8BWaQDca8=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69448422/_DSC6805_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpEjfk"&gt;Amazon is opening up access to its game streaming service Luna &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=23494951011"&gt;to all Amazon Prime members on June 21 and 22&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon Prime Day). Previously, to test out Luna you had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451371/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-service-twitch-alexa-controller"&gt;request access or sign up&lt;/a&gt; from supported Fire TV devices. But for this limited-time only, any Prime subscribers in the mainland US will be able to start a 7-day trial of Luna right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWQTsE"&gt;Luna is available on Windows PC, Mac, Fire TV, and via the web on iPhone, iPad, and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177222/amazon-luna-android-cloud-gaming-google-pixel-samsung-oneplus"&gt;select Android phones&lt;/a&gt;.” Regular pricing is $5.99 a month for access to games including &lt;em&gt;Control, GRID&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;. Or, once you’ve got a Luna account, you can pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel. This gets you access to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21494096011"&gt;big range of Ubisoft games&lt;/a&gt;, including the latest titles from the &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed, FarCry, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Watch Dogs &lt;/em&gt;franchises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="d5l15l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hands-on with Amazon’s Luna game streaming service","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mmlwvU"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/14/amazon-luna-invite-free-prime-day/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon is also discounting its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated Luna controller&lt;/a&gt; by 30 percent from June 14 to June 22, and knocking $40 off a bundle package including the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-Stick-Controller/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna controller and Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rICZw1"&gt;If you’re a Prime member and have been curious to see how Luna stacks up against Microsoft’s xCloud or Google Stadia, this is a good opportunity to check it out. Modify your expectations, though. In our early preview of Luna in October last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;we found that the service was very hit and miss&lt;/a&gt;: games load fast, but the library of available titles is small and internet speeds of at least 25Mbps are necessary for smooth play.&lt;/p&gt;
