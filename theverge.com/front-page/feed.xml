    <title>Banned brand Aukey is still selling earbuds on Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UjAJLvtD_xo9pL848lAjvWoyGXQ=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69630141/aukey_key_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zMGP3E"&gt;When Amazon started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;cracking down on mobile electronics companies&lt;/a&gt; with shady reviewer programs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Aukey and Mpow were the first to get whacked&lt;/a&gt; — and yet Aukey is still selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=key+series&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;at least three sets of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; at the giant online retailer, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9cJh0"&gt;Two weeks ago, I pointed out to Amazon PR that both Aukey and Mpow had seemingly found a way around their bans. Mpow had an “xMpow MFly” set of wireless Bluetooth headphones, and Aukey was selling several different sets under its “Key Series” sub-brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOj7u7"&gt;I’ve been watching their product pages ever since, and today I noticed that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-xMpow-Bluetooth-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B0924DCSYS?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=7&amp;amp;imprToken=30bd6f5a-5100-ccc2-9ce&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22331571%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the xMpow MFly has disappeared&lt;/a&gt;. But Key Series is alive and well with three products. Aukey appears to be paying Amazon extra to promote them in search, too, as you can see from their “sponsored” disclaimers:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6lwWvAlLczXmTI2wDyT2iCQLKCQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739467/key_series_sponsored.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aukey is paying to promote two of its wireless earbud sets at Amazon despite being thrown off the platform two months ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c9S9R1"&gt;There’s no question that these are Aukey products. You can see the Aukey brand printed on top of the charging case for those EP-N7 earbuds above. Aukey introduced the brand &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aukey-expands-into-premium-audio-with-key-series-300859685.html"&gt;with an official press release&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, and at least two Key Series products, including these T-10 wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AukeyOfficial/search?query=key%20series"&gt;have YouTube videos on the Aukey channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzuYzS"&gt;It’s vaguely possible that Key Series was spun off, or that these Amazon listings are run by a reseller, though. The Key Series website contains no official references to Aukey, but it does have one mention of a Primtech Limited based in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eJAncC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow are suddenly, suspiciously disappearing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"},{"title":"Amazon confirms it removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"},{"title":"Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kArOcy"&gt;But it also seems that Key Series had additional products on Amazon that did disappear. Similar to other electronics companies that were booted from Amazon, there are several blank spots &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/97D0F472-35CA-4D44-AA5B-6C48E9EA6459"&gt;on the brand’s Amazon seller page&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQxzYp"&gt;Related: I’m still collecting photos of your inserts from Amazon packages, whether they’re suspicious or not. They’ll help me with a future story. If you haven’t already, could you send me pictures of them at sean@theverge.com? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Steam Deck has an ‘optional built-in FPS limiter’ for better battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XsExetckOa06N0-Dw-9yH_i1Nr8=/0x0:1612x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69629946/steam_deck_004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q63Wmo"&gt;When Valve and &lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;revealed last Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589033/valve-steam-deck-pc-screen-performance-target-30hz-gameplay-upgradeable-ssd"&gt;that the new Steam Deck handheld will target 30Hz gameplay&lt;/a&gt;, not everyone was impressed with that low bar — but Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais has taken to Twitter to clarify his original comment, and reveal a new feature of the portable console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVQBzT"&gt;First, he says 30 fps is more of a minimum bar than anything else:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBYpcCItfAxhF48_evd9d5rjMNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22739341/steam_deck_30_fps_clarify.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1419087956535513093" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@Plagman2 (Twitter)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="obs0EW"&gt;“The ‘30 FPS target’ refers to the floor of what we consider playable in our performance testing; games we’ve tested and shown have consistently met and exceeded that bar so far,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woZ5NN"&gt;In other words, when Griffais &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3HnDR7A8yE"&gt;said in that IGN video interview&lt;/a&gt; that “We haven’t really found something that we could throw at this device that it couldn’t handle,” you shouldn’t take it to mean that every modern game runs at 60 fps. Expect less.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SQrMm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve’s gaming handheld is called the Steam Deck and it’s shipping in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"},{"title":"Why the Steam Deck won’t&amp;amp;nbsp;flop&amp;amp;nbsp;like Valve’s Steam Machines","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QvW5pN"&gt;Intriguingly, a 30 fps mode will be something you can proactively turn on to get more battery life, too. “There will also be an optional built-in FPS limiter to fine-tune perf vs. battery life,” he writes. The company’s already said you can play &lt;em&gt;Portal 2 &lt;/em&gt;for up to six hours at 30fps, compared to four hours normally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoXT9E"&gt;Will it be a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; 30 fps mode, though? That’s TBD. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1419294155994456073"&gt;In the replies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry’s &lt;/em&gt;Richard Leadbetter says Valve confirmed to him that the Steam Deck doesn’t have a variable-refresh-rate (VRR) screen, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1419294962655576066"&gt;and eludes to the idea&lt;/a&gt; that V-sync might wind up creating some nasty frame pacing issues if you try to lock games to 30Hz on the Deck’s screen. (&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; would know; it's &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-frame-rate-vs-frame-pacing"&gt;covered the issue&lt;/a&gt; many times across PC and console. &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sekiro &lt;/em&gt;developer From Software is &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-performance-analysis"&gt;notorious for inconsistent frame-pacing&lt;/a&gt;, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WHcVUH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A 30fps setting will be fine for demanding games, but with v-sync active please ensure that a new frame is synchronised with every other screen refresh (typical on consoles) to ensure consistency. 30fps capped but delivered unevenly at 16.7ms/33.3ms/50ms is not a great experience&lt;/p&gt;— Digital Foundry (@digitalfoundry) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1419294962655576066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TCLyK"&gt;Griffais hasn’t replied yet. We’ll see! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Dune, Star Trek: Prodigy, The Last Duel, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4f31d_9ILJbUQFMS7A7YY2I2F34=/253x0:1536x855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69627924/dune_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet in Dune | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idLGrJh8ybg&amp;amp;t=6s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Legendary" target="_blank"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AQYeNw"&gt;Happy Saturday! Posting the trailers roundup a day early this weekend since I’ll be on vacation starting Sunday (and shout out to the reader who said he preferred when we did the roundup on Saturdays, you got your wish at least for this weekend). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YadSHT"&gt;The internet (or at least the little corner I inhabit) seemed divided into camps this week: people who really like the Apple TV Plus show &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; and people who... don’t. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI&amp;amp;ab_channel=8O8X"&gt;OK to not like things&lt;/a&gt;! I had a longer rant prepared about how the effort to look cool online seems so exhausting but really, who cares, &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; has returned for season two and it’s still a lovely, warm-hearted show about a bunch of very likeable weirdos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1ofot"&gt;We ended up with a very sci-fi themed roundup this week which was not by design, but happened thanks to several new releases coming out during Comic-Con @ Home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9TWzBA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/idLGrJh8ybg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aD1fMP"&gt;Dune &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3wSgyU"&gt;Beautiful people looking wistfully at each other across sweeping landscapes as the wind tousles their hair— the first few seconds of the &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; trailer almost feel like a perfume commercial. But then we get down to brass tacks and the trailer... pretty much tells you the movie’s entire plot, as my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587655/dune-new-trailer-hbo-max-warner-bros-sandworm"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg noted in a first look&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the sandworm makes an appearance. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the much-awaited and oft-delayed &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, and Javier Bardem, comes to HBO Max and theaters on October 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uqEUI3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/987jSJZQxTs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vQqAvf"&gt;Star Trek: Prodigy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rUY9YI"&gt;In this new 10-episode series, a group of young aliens steals an abandoned Starfleet vessel called the USS Protostar, and are slowly trained in the ways of the Federation by a hologram version of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Voyager’d &lt;/em&gt;Captain Janeway (with Kate Mulgrew voicing the character she played on the series). &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Prodigy c&lt;/em&gt;omes to Paramount Plus this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YTuV3u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxdKo0eXUKY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TFCbWe"&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hlWVBq"&gt;The popular animated series that pokes fun at &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; lore returns for a second season, following the support crew of the USS Cerritos as they work aboard Starfleet’s least important ship. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/star-trek-lower-decks-renewed-season-three-paramount-season-2-teaser-1234727912/"&gt;already been renewed&lt;/a&gt; for a third season, and while last season took a few episodes to get its footing, the show ended up on a lot of “best of 2020” lists. Season two of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Lower Decks&lt;/em&gt; also debuts on Paramount Plus this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wiiT3o"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="vvYDzW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgygUwPJvYk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="A0klgq"&gt;The Last Duel &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WzpT9z"&gt;Based on a true story (and a book by Eric Jager), &lt;em&gt;The Last Duel&lt;/em&gt; tells the 14th-century tale of the last judicial trial by combat in France. Jodie Comer (looking very different from &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1"&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;) plays Marguerite de Carrouges, wife of knight Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon). She accuses Jacques LeGris (Adam Driver) of rape, which he denies. King Charles VI (Ben Affleck),  grants permission for them to settle things with a duel that will determine who is telling the truth. Oh and if her husband loses the duel, Marguerite gets burned at the stake for bearing false witness. Ridley Scott directed &lt;em&gt;The Last Duel&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters October 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eGc54z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahNgjVcq4sA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KGHxFm"&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4hrY00"&gt;This is the first trailer for this anime series, just revealed at Comic-Con. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/em&gt;is set in Los Angeles in 2032— so roughly halfway between the Harrison Ford &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhJ7Mf2Oxs&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Entertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movie and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCcx85zbxz4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures"&gt;Ryan Gosling sequel&lt;/a&gt;. A replicant named Elle (Jessica Henwick in the English-language version and Arisa Shida in the Japanese-language version) aka Black Lotus, has special powers and is being chased by some scary people. Directed by Shinji Aramaki and Kenji Kamiyama, the English version of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/em&gt;comes to Adult Swim and the Japanese version comes to Crunchyroll this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5dkEUI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tU9NhwYKCLM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kXwnoE"&gt;UFO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0cce1f"&gt;JJ Abrams is executive producer on this four-part documentary series that according to Showtime will explore “unsettling theories of a subject that recently reached national headlines,” namely a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html"&gt;2017 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; about a secret UFO program at the Department of Defense. &lt;em&gt;UFO&lt;/em&gt; debuts on Showtime August 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DoOOJs"&gt;“What’s your favorite planet?” is a real question that Robinhood execs really picked to answer during the Q&amp;amp;A section of its retail investor roadshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lj2TJB"&gt;“Definitely Pluto,” says long-haired CEO Vlad Tenev. He is having a good time. He goes on to explain that there will be a great view of Venus tonight after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJc0dQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first meme IPO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7CkXc"&gt;Many of the questions the management picked have been lackluster; asked if Robinhood will add a customer support line, Tenev cheerily explains there already is one. Another question is wasted on whether the stock will pay dividends — anyone who &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm"&gt;read the prospectus&lt;/a&gt; knows the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjNXJJ"&gt;I am watching this roadshow — my first, and the first, I suspect, of many who are watching — because Robinhood plans to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/robinhood-ipo.html"&gt;sell as much as a third of its IPO&lt;/a&gt; to its users. The roadshow is part of a plan to put retail investors on an “equal footing” (per the prospectus) with institutional investors. At the top of the presentation, I’m told that this is basically the same set of materials institutional investors get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdA2Rp"&gt;And why am I spending my Saturday on this? Well, it’s going to be the first meme IPO. And if this works, other companies may choose to boost the proportion of their shares they allocate to retail investors, says Pitchbook’s Robert Le, a senior analyst. Most IPOs allocate only 1 percent to 3 percent of their shares to retail investors, he says. If Robinhood ends its first day of trading higher than where it started, other companies may follow in its footsteps. However, if the stock trends down, institutional investors may steer clear of IPOs that include a large chunk of retail traders, Le says in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTiK9"&gt;Robinhood hasn’t offered its investors IPO access before, and that concerns David Erickson, who was co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays until he retired in 2013. (He is now a lecturer at &lt;a href="https://fnce.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/davider/"&gt;Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;.) “They don’t have the best internal controls,” Erickson says in an interview, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163048/robinhood-outages-major-2-days-leap-year-investing"&gt;pointing to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;Robinhood’s history&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;of outages&lt;/a&gt;. “For a company supposed to be in the business of keeping your money secure, they aren’t necessarily doing a good job of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eupHew"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were real, substantive questions eventually&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykfcso"&gt;During the roadshow, Tenev, his cofounder Baiju Bhatt — who is also rocking some lustrous locks  — and CFO Jason Warnick appear to be in an expensive and uncomfortable facsimile of a living room. They are seated on a white couch, with random wooden slats behind them; plants hang from the slats. In front of them, there are small wooden tables. Bhatt and Warnick are clearly reading from teleprompters. Many speakers featured on the call wore a pin of Robinhood’s feather logo — but not Tenev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLSpNt"&gt;There were real, substantive questions eventually. Though Robinhood doesn’t give a timeline, it is apparently working on creating wallets for its cryptocurrency users, allowing them to transfer in their crypto from elsewhere. Eventually there will be a beta, but because it’s impossible to recover cryptocurrency if it’s been handled wrong, Robinhood is proceeding slowly, Tenev says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Ule2"&gt;And as for payment for order flow, which makes up 81 percent of the first quarter revenue in 2021, Robinhood plans to work with regulators to answer concerns. This sounds suspiciously like Robinhood is planning to lobby — and it may also explain the&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/robinhood-hires-ex-regulators-to-help-address-compliance-issues?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt; former SEC employees hired at Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. As for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;angry meme stock customers&lt;/a&gt; that might leave? Tenev dodges the question. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash"&gt;Outages&lt;/a&gt;? Well, Robinhood says it’s investing resources to create redundancies so they won’t keep happening. (We’ll see!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esPCRu"&gt;The most interesting remarks are saved for the end. First, Robinhood is considering IRAs and Roth IRAs, two types of retirement accounts, as products it may offer. (Whether people want to save for retirement on their&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-02/robinhood-ipo-filing-is-a-lesson-in-meme-finance-kqmkzfxc"&gt; fun gambling app&lt;/a&gt; is an open question, but sure!) Second,  Robinhood thinks that retail investors are in the market to stay; it’s working to diversify by building out Robinhood Gold, its paid product, as well as cash management, more cryptocurrency offerings and fully paid securities lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRszvA"&gt;There is one notable omission in the roadshow. Despite its lovey-dovey mission statement about democratizing finance, the founders’ Class B stock gets 10 votes per share, while IPO investors’ Class A stock gets just one vote per share. Erickson, the Wharton lecturer, doesn’t like that, either. “This one bothers me like WeWork bothered me,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM, Cruise suing to stop Ford from using the name ‘BlueCruise’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gHy1hBQijfmfdYI27WuMciJCPns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69627021/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GM is suing Ford over the BlueCruise name for its hands-free driving system | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D5VZi"&gt;General Motors has filed a lawsuit to try to prevent Ford from using the name “BlueCruise” for the hands-free driving feature it announced earlier this year. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/07/24/gm-sues-ford-claiming-trademark-infringement-over-bluecruise-hands-free-name/8079309002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GM claims the name is too close Super Cruise, the name of is own hands-free driving technology introduced in 2017, and to its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise. GM is suing Ford for trademark infringement and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1JoMT"&gt;In the lawsuit filed Friday, GM said in that the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to resolve the matter. “Ford knew exactly what it was doing,” GM alleges in its complaint, adding that if Ford “wanted to adopt a new, unique brand, it easily could have done so without using the word ‘Cruise.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ6AWb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist system in April, and said it would begin pushing the feature via an over-the-air software updates to select vehicles later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HyCP9"&gt;GM didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. The company told the &lt;em&gt;Free Press&lt;/em&gt; that it would have preferred to resolve the situation amicably but was “left with no choice but to vigorously defend our brands and protect the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMfy1J"&gt;A Ford spokesperson called GM’s Cruise claim “meritless and frivolous,” in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that cruise control is a well-known term. “Every automaker offers it, and ‘cruise’ is common shorthand for the capability. That’s why BlueCruise was chosen as the name for the Blue Oval’s next evolution of Ford’s Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control,” the spokesperson added (the “Blue Oval” refers to Ford’s logo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmcSQ9"&gt;Indeed, there are several other automakers who use the word “cruise” to describe their hands-free driving features, including Hyundai’s Smart Cruise Control, and BMW’s Active Cruise Control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4skXp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New job posting shows Amazon seeking a digital currency and blockchain expert</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon may be testing the cryptocurrency waters | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GNPvkV"&gt;Amazon is hiring a digital currency and blockchain product lead for its payments team, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1644513/digital-currency-and-blockchain-product-lead"&gt;new job listing&lt;/a&gt;. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cryptocurrency-seeks-new-blockchain-leader-customers-payments-ecommerce-2021-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ecommerce giant is looking for an “experienced product leader to develop Amazon’s Digital Currency and Blockchain strategy and product roadmap.” The listing, which Amazon has confirmed is legitimate, continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E2ZC8R"&gt;You will leverage your domain expertise in Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Cryptocurrency to develop the case for the capabilities which should be developed, drive overall vision and product strategy, and gain leadership buy-in and investment for new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Fxv7"&gt;Amazon.com doesn’t accept cryptocurrency as payment, but a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “inspired by the innovation happening in the cryptocurrency space and are exploring what this could look like on Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP2RrZ"&gt;Amazon’s cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already has a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/"&gt;managed blockchain&lt;/a&gt; service. But CEO Andy Jassy said in 2017 when he was head of the AWS division that the company was “watching” the space  but that Amazon didn’t see “a lot of practical use cases for blockchain that are much broader than using a distributed ledger,” &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-not-buying-into-the-blockchain-hype/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time. That would appear to be changing if this new listing is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koPjir"&gt;Apple posted a &lt;a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200247094/business-development-manager-alternative-payments?team=MKTG"&gt;similar listing&lt;/a&gt; in May for a business development manager for “alternative payments,” and among the key qualifications for the role was five years of experience “working in or with alternative payment providers, such as digital wallets, BNPL, Fast Payments, cryptocurrency and etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpTjDj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6K9zQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genki ShadowCast review: a clever but limited capture card</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A viable option for streamers and gamers on the go&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="9WxLoT"&gt;The ShadowCast from Genki is a dongle-size video capture card that might provide all that some gamers and streamers need. It’s $45, a relatively low price for a no-frills device that can get your console games onto your PC. But it has some limitations. The video quality isn’t great, and there’s a noticeable amount of lag if you’re trying to play along with the stream. These compromises aren’t a surprise, considering the ShadowCast costs a fraction of the price of something more capable like &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/game-capture-hd60-s-plus"&gt;Elgato’s HD60 S+&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YspjMR"&gt;You can actually go a bit cheaper than Genki’s $45 if you’re willing to roll the dice on quality control. Last year we covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346571/cheap-cam-link-capture-card-streamer-clone-review-test-price"&gt;an affordable (between $10 and $30, usually) no-brand HDMI capture card&lt;/a&gt; that’s very similar to this one, and perhaps its port arrangement may be more convenient for you. Unlike the ShadowCast, which plugs into an HDMI port and has a USB-C-in port on its other end, the cheaper alternative has HDMI-in and USB-out, so you can just plug in an HDMI cable you may already own. Genki gets the nod, though, both in terms of build quality and its companion software. I’ll get into the latter part below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kvTkVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10666378"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLxVns"&gt;It’s easy to get the ShadowCast up and running on PC or macOS. It’ll work with any device with an HDMI-out port, so the PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and some older consoles are covered. That also includes DSLR or mirrorless cameras that you might want to use as a high-end webcam. The ShadowCast has a USB-C port on its other side, which you can connect to your PC with the included six-foot USB-C-to-C 2.0 cable, or your own C-to-A cable. It also works seamlessly with streaming applications like OBS Studio. If you’re using the ShadowCast as an interface for a camera, it’ll work with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and other popular video conferencing apps. You might need a dongle if your camera doesn’t have a full-sized HDMI port. A micro or mini HDMI dongle should get the job done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZNMP3"&gt;When I hooked up the ShadowCast to my Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II camera to use it as a webcam, it worked well, with negligible latency issues.. It produces far better colors and clarity than a traditional webcam, though in my case, I could only get an image through HDMI by bumping the camera’s output resolution down to 720p. That may be an issue with my camera, and not the ShadowCast, so your camera may be able to output to higher resolutions without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tyu29e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10666381"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Dmv92"&gt;The ShadowCast’s specs are competitive for sub-$50 capture solutions, and its flaws are generally similar, too. It supports up to 1080p input resolution at 30 frames per second, or a 720p image at a faster 60 frames per second. Both modes offer varying levels of graininess, so this device isn’t for people aiming to show all of the granular visual details in PS5 games — or really any game — with pixel-perfect representation. Fidelity aside, I noticed that colors from some sample images and footage look less vibrant and have less contrast than I’d see by directly connecting my console to a monitor. Neither flaw is that surprising, given the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="viEETg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10666385"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bktjSW"&gt;The lag while gaming is another issue. The delay in the incoming video feed is perceivable to the point that it may be game-breaking depending on your preferences. Lag is really only an issue if you’re playing strictly through the feed coming in from the ShadowCast; most streamers who want to play and stream at the same time from a console use an HDMI splitter and instead play their games on a screen that has a direct connection to their console, thus avoiding latency. I used the ShadowCast with other cables, as well as USB-C and USB-A ports on two different computers, but the latency issues were the same no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzAki7"&gt;The ShadowCast is a viable but limited option for streamers compared to pricier options. But it’s more user-friendly than some other competitors if all you want to do is record yourself talking over gameplay and upload the video to your channel later on. Genki makes that easy to do &lt;a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/shadowcast"&gt;through its free Arcade app for macOS&lt;/a&gt; and Windows 10 machines. More impressively, it works &lt;a href="https://arcade.genkithings.com/"&gt;through Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, too&lt;/a&gt;. Once your console is connected, you can hit record and chat through your microphone as you play, and the recording will pick up both game audio and your voice. You can take snapshots, too, which is handy if you’re making guides for game walkthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A snapshot taken from the browser version of Genki Arcade shows the full suite of tools, including voice recording, screenshots, and video recording." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wDoZ0j5G5J3IzArd-Qsj5MgyJrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22736641/genkishadowcastbrowser.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A snapshot taken from the browser version of Genki Arcade shows the full suite of tools, including voice recording, screenshots, and video recording.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AwZ8H5"&gt;The app on macOS and the browser-based versions offer all of the features above. But on Windows, it’ll let you play your games, but you can’t record footage or mic audio currently. The macOS app also outputs different types of files than the browser version. On macOS, you’ll get an .mp4 file, but the browser-based version outputs a .webm video file that’s viewable (and can be converted to .mp4) in VLC Player. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s an extra step, since you’ll likely need to convert it to a more compatible video file format before uploading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DMDscr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDiGOMTJXPQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyF9JB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a clip recorded through the Genki Arcade software in “Favor Performance” mode, which sets the ShadowCast to 720p at 60 frames per second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="knqZhG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MS2868hTmK8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4V91Cu"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a clip recorded through the Genki Arcade software in “Favor Resolution” mode, which sets the ShadowCast to 1080p at 30 frames per second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhl4Lz"&gt;Genki is also touting that its app and the ShadowCast should appeal to people who casually use their laptops or desktops as a display for their game consoles. There’s little reason to do this if you have a nearby TV, since you’ll get less latency with a direct connection. This method makes a lot more sense if you’re in, say, a hotel with just your laptop, or if you don’t own a dedicated TV and the biggest screen you’ve got is your desktop all-in-one. If those highly specific circumstances describe your situation, this isn’t a bad way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsbKHO"&gt;Whatever your use cases are, Genki claims that its Arcade app has less latency than if you were to run the ShadowCast as a video source through OBS Studio, when tested on a 2020 base model M1 13-inch MacBook Pro. At most, it says the reduction in latency can be up to 50ms, but that it varies and may be less than that. But on my setup, the reduction in latency with the Arcade app wasn’t too noticeable. Genki told me that latency can be impacted by factors like whether you’re using a laptop that’s being charged versus running off the battery, and whether your PC’s specs can keep up. In my case, it feels similar to playing games via cloud streaming over a so-so internet connection. Like I mentioned above, that might be a deal-breaker for some, or not a concern for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mscdGM"&gt;If you’re skeptical about the ShadowCast, $45 isn’t that much to gamble, compared to pricier solutions. I like the companion software (including a web-based solution), which simplifies putting your game on a PC or laptop screen. And as a streaming solution, its video quality is serviceable, so long as capturing high-fidelity footage isn’t essential.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="E-bikes popularity grows" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11eT2n79qkGRUxsgs6AhMjTt38s=/332x0:5027x3130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626458/1311180591.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0RxGd"&gt;A bill that would offer Americans a refundable tax credit on the purchase of a new electric bicycle was just introduced in the Senate by Ed Markey (D-MA) and Brian Schatz (D-HI). The bill is called the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment, or E-BIKE Act for short, and it’s the companion bill to one introduced in the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbH59m"&gt;E-bikes are more expensive than normal bikes, typically costing anywhere from $1,000 to $8,000 for some of the more high-end models. But they also have the potential to replace car trips for a lot of people, with a recent study finding that if 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.bicycling.com_news_a33798099_e-2Dbikes-2Dcan-2Dreduce-2Dcarbon-2Demissions-2Dstudy_-23-3A-7E-3Atext-3DTake-2520an-2520E-252DBike-2520to-2Cemissions-2520would-2520drop-252012-2520percent.-26text-3DResearch-2520from-2520a-2520recent-2520study-2Creducing-2520carbon-2520emissions-2520in-2520cities.&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&amp;amp;r=Kaw85Xe8TfA6OxCjbhxHHlKZN2OTQje-DKAJWPsTvmQ&amp;amp;m=TGIC8E3VcNB9fNV9rlqspnybSAaSvRDYUI4CaLwl9B4&amp;amp;s=pn6j7tb5RRf9wPkw9K3jBBueYbBKOGZTr8pdj7KdhkQ&amp;amp;e="&gt;carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GEAPQk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the electrification of transportation is not just about cars”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ElWXUP"&gt;This afternoon, I conducted a brief interview with Senator Schatz over text message to get a sense of the legislation’s goals, its chances in Congress, and whether he himself would ever consider buying an e-bike. (He said no, but I think I got him to reconsider.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Lhvg"&gt;“The idea is simple,” Schatz said, “the electrification of transportation is not just about cars, it’s about every way to get around.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MN7t2A"&gt;At its core, the bill is about accessibility, the senator said. More people should be riding e-bikes than just those who can afford them. Driving is already highly subsidized across the country. We build cheap — often free — areas for parking, we invest in highways, drivers don’t pay for congestion or CO2 emissions, and zoning laws and taxes favor sprawl. We need to start accommodating bikes — and especially e-bikes — if we want more people to switch to greener forms of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJWBKt"&gt;“The bill makes a clean alternative more accessible to more people,” Schatz said. “E-bikes make lots of sense for working people, young people, and others who either cannot afford or don’t want a car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoPIkN"&gt;Much like the House bill, Schatz and Markey’s legislation would offer Americans a refundable tax credit worth 30 percent of a new e-bike’s purchase price, capped at $1,500. All three e-bike classes would be eligible for the tax credit, but bikes with motors more powerful than 750W would not. The credit would also be fully refundable, which would allow lower-income individuals to claim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NivS6h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A common refrain you hear from critics of this legislation is that people won’t switch to bikes without safer infrastructure to support it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XXRJ62"&gt;A common refrain you hear from critics of this legislation is that people won’t switch to bikes without safer infrastructure to support it. Protected bike lanes are still in short supply in the US, and it’s unclear whether a surge in demand for e-bikes would necessarily lead to better policy decisions on the local level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw39r3"&gt;Schatz said there needs to be a “major infusion of physical infrastructure for bike lanes and safe streets” for this bill to have the desirable outcome, which is more people switching from cars to e-bikes. There is &lt;a href="https://www.peopleforbikes.org/news/what-could-bidens-infrastructure-plan-mean-for-bikes"&gt;$20 billion in President Biden’s infrastructure proposal&lt;/a&gt; for safe street improvements, which include bike lanes. But whether that money survives in the final deal — if there is a final deal — remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMkBns"&gt;“I’m optimistic,” Schatz said about the potential passage of the E-BIKE Act, “but this overall package will face multiple near-death experiences before it becomes law. We plan to get it through in the coming package, but if we don’t, we will keep pushing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HrAg2"&gt;The House version of the bill has 21 co-sponsors — all Democrats — while the Senate version is just now making the rounds. But Schatz said he doesn’t think it will be a tough sell with his colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X1d0Lw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We anticipate that we will be able to build momentum for this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTeLxX"&gt;“We anticipate that we will be able to build momentum for this,” he said. “It’s one of those rare ideas that is both revolutionary and noncontroversial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H47yR5"&gt;And while Schatz said he’s only tried riding an e-bike once, while on vacation, and doesn’t have any immediate plans to buy one for himself, he would reconsider, given his newly acquired position as an advocate for this mode of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztznwM"&gt;Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC, has a number of pedal-assist e-bikes in rotation. Just sayin’. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard exec calls sexual harassment allegations ‘extremely troubling’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uianmWaBQvUiIhudH32jPptAe4c=/106x0:3742x2424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626424/1233534678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A new lawsuit alleges widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard | Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4axai"&gt;The president of Blizzard Entertainment sent an email to staff calling allegations of sexual harassment at the company “extremely troubling.” First reported by Jason Schreier at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, J. Allen Brack wrote that “the fight for equality is incredibly important to me,” and that he has spent his career fighting against “bro culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaRfgc"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;(DFEH) filed suit against Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and owner Activision Blizzard on Tuesday, alleging a culture of “constant sexual harassment” existed at the company.  The complaint describes a “frat boy culture” that included male employees drinking and sexually harassing female employees without repercussions. Brack is named in the complaint as being one of the people at the company who was allegedly aware and enabling of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XPib1p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack sent out an email to staff last night addressing the allegations from this week's explosive lawsuit, calling them "extremely troubling" and saying that he'd be "meeting with many of you to answer questions and discuss how we can move forward." &lt;a href="https://t.co/NsMV6CNdTE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NsMV6CNdTE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418512291218264065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bt8zyB"&gt;According to the DFEH complaint, “male employees would play video games during work, engage in banter about their sexual encounters, talk openly about female bodies, and make numerous jokes about rape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29qX1E"&gt;Women were subjected to numerous sexual advances and comments, the lawsuit states, including groping and other forms of harassment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e1dC9U"&gt;A female employee noted that random male employees would approach her on Defendants’ work site and comment on her breasts. Female employees working for the World of Warcraft team noted that male employees and supervisors would hit on them, make derogatory comments about rape, and otherwise engage in demeaning behavior. This behavior was known to supervisors and indeed encouraged by them, including a male supervisor openly encouraging a male subordinate to “buy” a prostitute to cure his bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2ABhl"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting, his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4rjYuV"&gt;Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend sent an email to staff the same day as Brack, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418619091515068421?s=20"&gt;according to Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, but with a different tone, saying the lawsuit presented an “untrue picture” of the company, adding that it was “meritless.” Her comments echoed an official statement released by the company that called the DFEH lawsuit “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California,” and said the suit included “distorted, and in many cases, false descriptions of Blizzard’s past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIvruf"&gt;Activision Blizzard didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Mario 64 probably won’t be the last million-dollar video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xQOr_3LYR6AultfQV43tpdqyL4Y=/0x15:955x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626180/screenshot01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Super Mario 64. | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD80Lj"&gt;Earlier this month, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; sold for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572688/super-mario-64-most-expensive-video-game-ever-heritage-auctions"&gt;$1,560,000&lt;/a&gt; at auction, a staggering price that nearly doubled a record set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;just two days before by a similarly pristine copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The auctions could mark just the beginning of even more eye-poppingly large video game sales. It seems very likely that Mario’s first 3D adventure won’t be the last game to command a million-dollar sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUpy3B"&gt;“I think we’ll see more million dollar games, probably sooner rather than later,” Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse, a developer that works on rereleases of classic video games, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eDDdt8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Collecting and selling stuff has become a popular trend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9URY8z"&gt;Collecting and selling stuff — both physical and virtual — for expensive prices has become a popular trend. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; cards are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276738/pokemon-trading-card-game-printing-short-supply-high-demand"&gt;massively popular&lt;/a&gt;. Some NFTs, a form of digital collectible, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;sold for millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;. And people have been pouring huge amounts of money into assets like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255955/robinhood-cryptocurrency-restrictions-dogecoin-wallstreetbets"&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop’s stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jS4Nve"&gt;Video games continue to be hugely popular — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;more than half of Americans turned to video games during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; — and retro games have already had a recent history of becoming collectors’ items. Just over a year ago, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; claimed the record of being the most expensive video game ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;by selling for $114,000&lt;/a&gt;, a figure that was huge at the time but is less than a tenth of what &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; just auctioned for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uhAsK"&gt;Kohler expects that the next game to break the million-dollar threshold could be a very early printing of The &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, like what sold this month, or another &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; Danielle Smith, owner of Nerdy Girl Comics, agrees. “I think that the market has kind of spoken for itself and that Mario is king and Zelda is queen of video games,” she said. Smith also said that &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; for the Sega Genesis could potentially be a valuable title. That’s not only because of his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21133092/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-paramount"&gt;cultural cache right now&lt;/a&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; sealed is really hard to come by,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RDgMDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The supply of sealed video games is much lower than many other collectibles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqad2v"&gt;It’s not just &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt;. People who are coming into collecting top-notch games may find that supply is much lower than it is in other collectibles markets. “I think that we are going to continue to see record breaking sales [in games],” said Deniz Kahn, president and founder of Wata Games, the company that evaluated both &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; for quality before they were listed for auction. “At the end of the day, there’s just simply not enough supply of these high end, high grade, sealed, vintage video games to satiate the demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7QKHV"&gt;That’s slightly different than other collectible categories. “Over the last few years there have been a lot of people who have started collecting other areas, like comics or coins or cards, and their markets are very mature,” he said. In comics, “at this point all of the copies of &lt;em&gt;Action Comics #1&lt;/em&gt; have been flushed out of attics into collectors’ hands. People in the [gaming] hobby — collectors, investors — we’re all realizing that the populations of these sealed games are so incredibly low when you compare them to, say, sports cards or comic books,” he added. “There aren’t hundreds of these in high, perfect grade out there. In some cases, there’s one, or 10, or five.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUTa9Z"&gt;Another thing that may be driving up prices is that the games are selling at public auction, meaning that everyone can see the price of an eventual sale. Before that, according to Kahn, “when a five figure video game sale would occur, which was a big deal four or five years ago, I knew about it and maybe 10 other guys knew about it. It all happened behind closed doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C0GIgk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The company that graded the million-dollar copy of Super Mario 64 has a new owner","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577409/wata-games-acquired-collectors-universe-video-game-grading-super-mario-64-legend-of-zelda"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PnGd8U"&gt;All of the recent record holders have been sold on Heritage Auctions, and the games sold have been graded for quality by Wata Games &lt;a href="https://www.watagames.com/what-we-do/wata-scale"&gt;on a 10-point scale&lt;/a&gt; similar to what’s used for comics. According to Kohler, the partnership between Wata and Heritage makes it safer for people to have confidence that the game they’re bidding on is of the quality that’s advertised. “You’re not just buying it from shadyguy123 on eBay,” he said. “You know you’re buying from Heritage Auctions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWJ9XC"&gt;“The sales that occur [on Heritage] are now almost an indicator of health,” Kahn said. “It’s a pulse on the market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52z4cb"&gt;The person who bought the million-dollar &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t come forward publicly, so it’s unclear exactly why they dropped such a huge amount of money on the one game. But Valarie McLeckie, consignment director of video games at Heritage Auctions, said that those who have been buying ultra-rare games are driven by nostalgia. “The types of people who are buying these games are seeking mint-condition examples of the games they played as a kid,” she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVTO1C"&gt;Kahn speculates that for some, Nintendo 64 games may hit that nostalgia sweet spot that encourages them to buy. “I think [for] the generation that’s really heavily getting involved in alternative assets, the Nintendo 64 era, for example, resonates a lot more with that demographic,” he said. “I think that might also be the reason that we’re all very surprised that the first million-dollar-plus video game was a Nintendo 64 game. I don’t think anyone could have predicted that. But it goes to show the power of emotion and nostalgia and how much of a role that plays despite all the other factors that drive demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FLDh3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The high prices could have a positive impact on video game preservation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUp170"&gt;These record-breaking sales could have a positive impact on video game preservation, which is already a challenging problem due to the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516254/video-game-history-foundation-secret-of-monkey-island-code"&gt;technology changes and decays&lt;/a&gt;. If more people try to sell their video games to get in on the market, treasures that had been buried could see the light of day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ2xbw"&gt;“What I think that people do not understand is that so much stuff, even to this day, gets thrown in the trash,” Kohler said. “If there’s one really great beneficial impact that something like this is going to have — especially because it passed that magical million dollar number where everybody, the mainstream news, is all paying attention to it — the beneficial impact this has is [that] fewer people will throw away their video games.”&lt;/p&gt;
