    <title>Hulu’s Watch Party feature is now available to all subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fJUXD2sBHE7TBjOkcmsFyDZQzQc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68418404/Happiest_Season_Hulu_Watch_Party.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Hulu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vbCyze"&gt;Hulu was first among the major streaming services to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273246/hulu-watch-party-feature-how-to-use-test"&gt;a way for multiple people to watch its shows and movies together&lt;/a&gt; at the same time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, that Watch Party feature is expanding to all subscribers — not just those people paying for the ad-free plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZdBe6"&gt;Watch Party is available on Hulu’s website. You’ll see the icon on a title’s details page. From there, you can share a Watch Party link with up to seven other Hulu subscribers so that everyone can watch the same content together from afar. Hulu says that “while watching, group members will be able to react in real-time through the chat function and control their own playback.” If you find yourself having to pause while your friends keep watching, there’s a “click to catch up” button to get right back to the same spot as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9q7hu"&gt;You can use Watch Party with “thousands” of titles from Hulu’s on-demand library, including the company’s new original rom-com film &lt;em&gt;The Happiest Season&lt;/em&gt;, which Hulu says broke streaming records when it premiered over Thanksgiving weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6H0LK"&gt;A number of third-party co-watch apps rose in popularity during the early quarantine phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432411/disney-plus-watch-party-feature-test-canada-scener-netflix-amazon-prime-video"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345413/movies-anywhere-viewing-party-feature-watch-together-screen-pass-lending-app"&gt;Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452744/sling-tv-watch-party-live-tv-beta-chrome-available-now"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/a&gt; have begun offering their own built-in solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI’s FPV racing drone looks mighty real in these leaked photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I0iZweah5aZ_iRxJ6E5t9-LU--Q=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68410986/dji_fpv_combo_leak.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6bfnXq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8932222/dji-fpv-racing-drone-rumor-fcc-filings"&gt;For a brief moment last July&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed like drone maker DJI was going to dive straight into drone racing with a speedy FPV (first-person-view) drone of its own. In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747609/dji-new-fpv-goggles-camera-drone-racing-filming-hd-high-definition-kit-price"&gt;it merely dipped a toe&lt;/a&gt; — but a little over a year later, it looks like the company is nearly ready to announce a racing drone after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rzzgm"&gt;You’re now looking at leaked images of what appears to be called the “DJI FPV,” and it certainly doesn’t look like any drone the company’s released before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qqJiOt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like spaceship!&lt;br&gt;Someone who got evaluation didn't keep their NDA. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qyFycphly6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qyFycphly6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OsitaLV (@OsitaLV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1334084415694073856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="k2EBNt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Overlord, this is FPV 1, requesting take off.&lt;br&gt;FPV 1 you are cleared to take off, please proceed to helipad one.&lt;br&gt;Solid copy Overlord, FPV 1 taking off at helipad one.&lt;br&gt;FPV 1, you have the sky, have nice trip, over and out.&lt;br&gt;Copy that, FPV 1 out. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GTw6A2w4mR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GTw6A2w4mR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OsitaLV (@OsitaLV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1334176526586187778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="lalfT7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;5.8GHz &amp;amp; 915MHz ready, I think this is it. Rumor says some resellers have got the evaluation model of FPV Drone, with remote-adjustable FPV camera. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yVUKS96q99"&gt;https://t.co/yVUKS96q99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OsitaLV (@OsitaLV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1329297607789666304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2BH5JU"&gt;Without any hard specs or even the barest idea of price, it’s tough to judge what we’re looking at, but the three-blade propellers, sizable hump, and minimalist controller are all a departure from the company’s many previous drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIcsB3"&gt;That makes sense, since FPV racing and filming focuses on speed over all else. You’ll generally tilt your entire drone far beyond the angle you’d tilt a traditional filmmaking drone to maximize your forward momentum — and when you do, you need a camera that primarily tilts up, not down. And if you’re going to be wearing an FPV headset all the time (it appears to come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747609/dji-new-fpv-goggles-camera-drone-racing-filming-hd-high-definition-kit-price"&gt;the DJI FPV Goggles&lt;/a&gt;), you don’t really need a holder for your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu2pf9"&gt;These leaks all come by way of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV"&gt;OsitaLV on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/02/dji-fpv-drone-leaks-in-latest-images-release-near/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who has a reputation for finding out DJI’s news before it’s official. Most recently, OsitaLV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1317291858251350017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;shared images and details&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524505/dji-osmo-pocket-2-price-release-date-features-4k-video-gimbal"&gt;DJI Pocket 2&lt;/a&gt; four days before it was announced. They also recently shared an image &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/11/24/leaked-photo-mavic-pro-3/"&gt;of a possible Mavic Pro 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMQMY1"&gt;Early last month, DJI’s Brendan Schulman teased that the company might still have another product announcement this year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPjCMl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;DJI released six new products in the past three weeks. Surely, everyone feels we must be done for the year. &lt;a href="https://t.co/e9xet6LheP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/e9xet6LheP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brendan Schulman (@dronelaws) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dronelaws/status/1324492559863996416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zP1YrL"&gt;Perhaps this is it?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber reportedly will sell its flying taxi business to secretive startup Joby Aviation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1CnwT2qnlVzkZgx6bm1VaoeJ_8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68409894/ECRM003_hero_shot__1___1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="66QegU"&gt;Uber’s ambitious and quixotic effort to launch a flying taxi service is coming in for a landing. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-190158b9-9753-4f6d-a857-39f93af93222.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ride-hailing company has agreed to sell its Uber Elevate division to secretive startup Joby Aviation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKMiEp"&gt;The news comes as Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi attempts to push his company closer to profitability, which includes the sale of the money-losing parts of the business. The company is also said to be exploring the sale of its autonomous vehicle division. A spokesperson for Uber declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QVLhG"&gt;Uber first announced its interest in launching a network of electric flying taxis in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434580/uber-flying-car-elevate-self-driving-vtol"&gt;a white paper published in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Under Uber’s calculations, a two-hour, 12-minute slog from San Francisco to San Jose would become a breezy 15 minutes by flying car. A two-hour, 10-minute battle through São Paulo gridlock would be transformed into an 18-minute pleasure ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4XKWkK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber first announced its interest in launching a network of electric flying taxis in a white paper published in 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50s2RI"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655126/uber-copter-new-york-city-jfk-airport-elevate-helicopter-flying-taxi-price"&gt;Uber starting offering helicopter trips&lt;/a&gt; from Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The trips were meant to offer a taste of what the experience would be like to use the Uber app to summon a flight rather than a car ride, and the company certainly saw it as an opportunity to gather data for its air taxi plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa1s2A"&gt;Those plans were ambitious, and perhaps doomed, from the start. It relied on a technology — electric-powered aviation — that was still under development and had yet to be tested as part of a commercial service. And it would have been costly to implement, requiring the construction of a vast network of rooftop or ground-level “skyports” and regulatory approval from a host of federal, state, and local agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgnKkZ"&gt;The choice of Joby Aviation as buyer makes sense. In December 2019, the ride-hailing company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029943/uber-joby-aviation-flying-car-air-taxi-2023"&gt;join forces with the Northern California-based aerospace company&lt;/a&gt;, which has been working on electric aircraft for over a decade. Joby was the first company to commit to Uber’s aggressive timetable to launch a flying taxi service by 2023. A spokesperson for Joby declined to comment as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UteFAA"&gt;Joby is the brainchild of inventor JoeBen Bevirt, who started the company in 2009 and operated it in relative obscurity until 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16959698/joby-aviation-evtol-100-million-investment"&gt;Joby announced&lt;/a&gt; it had raised a surprising $100 million from a variety of investors, including the venture capital arms of Intel, Toyota, and JetBlue. The money helped finance the development of the company’s air taxi prototype, which has been conducting test flights at Joby’s private airfield in Northern California. Bevirt helps run an incubator outside of Santa Cruz that’s been described as a &lt;a href="https://pando.com/2013/07/03/the-startup-ranch-of-santa-cruz/"&gt;quasi-commune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDzeEe"&gt;Unlike the dozens of other companies that are currently building electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Joby has kept much of its project under wraps. The few renderings that are out there show a plane-drone hybrid with 12 rotors and room in the cabin for four passengers, though a spokesperson previously cautioned that what Joby is working on now is “entirely new.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqOzDF"&gt;The company lifted the curtain in January 2020, when it announced it had closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;massive $590 million round of venture capital funding&lt;/a&gt;. Joby also announced that it was teaming up with previous investor Toyota to launch an air taxi service using its new aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNTaE7"&gt;The all-electric aircraft has six rotors and seats five, including the pilot. It can take off vertically, like a helicopter, and then shift into forward flight using tilt rotors. Joby says it can reach a top speed of 200 mph, travel 150 miles on a single charge, and is 100 times quieter than a conventional aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFrwdA"&gt;Of course, many companies — Joby included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, had to reorganize &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/12/01/inside-larry-pages-kitty-hawk-returned-deposits-battery-fires-boeing-cora/#c6e934858ab4"&gt;amid reports&lt;/a&gt; about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits. Another startup, Zunum, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612702/zunum-aero-sues-boeing-fraud-hybrid-electric-jet"&gt;locked in a bitter legal figh&lt;/a&gt;t with its former investor, Boeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggbpN3"&gt;The jury is still out on whether an electric vertical takeoff and landing-based air taxi system would make an appreciable contribution to a next-generation transportation system, or whether it would simply be an escape hatch for the super-rich to avoid street-level traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEdmCp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Galaxy Buds Pro image reveals new rounded design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgCgNHVtNnOgxTnlkTS6TNO0u8I=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68388280/galaxy_buds_pro.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKdq2P"&gt;An image of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds has leaked, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1"&gt;noted leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nokmco"&gt;You can see the apparent image of the headphones at the top of this post. They look to have a more rounded shape than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an image of what the Galaxy Buds Plus look like, for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tn-fX96eR_5b9lex_3JWl0-94hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137433/DSCF5554.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cBqOZS"&gt;Blass also posted a render that apparently shows the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro — a render looks similar to a diagram of the case found in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726569/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-fcc-regulatory-filing"&gt;recent FCC filings&lt;/a&gt; for the Galaxy Buds Pro. Instead of the more oblong shape of the case for the Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds Plus, the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro looks to be more of a square with rounded corners, like the one for Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1H4VtYBYsCT_Qjcz703vZDiND9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137401/b63d057b303988a415aa6c765760bb5a137c30e78c3292c4b5e5f9a1c0167de5.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked render of the Galaxy Buds Pro case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SsuHss"&gt;A new shape and new case aren’t the only new updates reportedly coming to the Galaxy Buds Pro — they may also have active noise cancellation and improvements to ambient mode, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-buds-with-galaxy-s21-details/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro are expected to be revealed alongside the Galaxy S21 phones in January, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Na4o18"&gt;Studio Supergiant Games has been in the business of making excellent games for the last decade — including &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Transistor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pyre&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which each have received something like universal acclaim from critics and fans alike. Part of what makes those games so special is their soundtracks, composed by Darren Korb. And now Korb’s work is getting its own standalone anniversary release in the form of the record &lt;em&gt;The Songs of Supergiant Games: 10th Anniversary Orchestral Collection. &lt;/em&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://store.supergiantgames.com/products/the-songs-of-supergiant-games-10th-anniversary-collection-vinyl-standard-edition"&gt;preorder the (translucent red!) vinyl now for shipping in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, or you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUHvI4dgY8w"&gt;listen to the whole thing on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google illegally spied on workers before firing them, US labor board alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DOUNIAMAG-BRITAIN-IRELAND-US-INTERNET-SEXISM-COMPANY-GOOGLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9SrPTFVkBDFXXpI0DSVsKH98Vs=/0x0:5275x3517/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68381034/1056016666.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p2PTlH"&gt;Google violated US labor laws by spying on workers who were organizing employee protests, then firing two of them, according to a complaint to be filed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VABe0z"&gt;The complaint names two employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, both of whom were fired by the company in late 2019 in connection with employee activism. Berland was organizing against Google’s decision to work with IRI Consultants, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;a firm widely known for its anti-union efforts&lt;/a&gt;, when he was let go for reviewing other employees’ calendars. Now, the NLRB has found Google’s policy against employees looking at certain coworkers’ calendars is unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jU542"&gt;“Google’s hiring of IRI is an unambiguous declaration that management will no longer tolerate worker organizing,” Berland said in a statement. “Management and their union busting cronies wanted to send that message, and the NLRB is now sending their own message: worker organizing is protected by law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otelr5"&gt;Spiers was fired after she created a pop-up for Google employees visiting the IRI Consultants website. “Googlers have the right to participate in protected concerted activities,” the notification read, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/fifth-google-worker-activist-fired-in-a-month-says-company-is-targeting-the-vulnerable"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company said Spiers had violated security policies, a statement that hurt her reputation in the tech community. Now, the NLRB has found the firing was unlawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaHZL2"&gt;“This week the NLRB issued a complaint on my behalf. They found that I was illegally terminated for trying to help my colleagues,” Spiers said. “Colleagues and strangers believe I abused my role because of lies told by Google management while they were retaliating against me. The NLRB can order Google to reinstate me, but it cannot reverse the harm done to my credibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3sMtc"&gt;Google, once known as the happiest company in tech, has been roiled in scandal in recent years. The company &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;paid former executive Andy Rubin $90 million&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a sexual harassment investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;which set off a wave of protests at offices across the globe&lt;/a&gt;. More than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees and contractors&lt;/a&gt; participated in the walkouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD4WcJ"&gt;Workers have also protested the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199818/google-pentagon-project-maven-pull-out-letter-ceo-sundar-pichai"&gt;work with the Department of Defense on Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;, an AI initiative that could help the US improve drone strike capabilities.  In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199818/google-pentagon-project-maven-pull-out-letter-ceo-sundar-pichai"&gt;more than 3,100 employees signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; urging CEO Sundar Pichai to pull out of the project. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube expands its Premieres feature with trailers and live redirects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LQTbnooQ0rE3Xlp6qpSa1m2GFxs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68378905/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6tdQkA"&gt;YouTube is building on its Premieres feature — used for live-streaming pre-recorded videos — by adding support for trailers, redirects from live pre-shows, and customized countdown timers. The company says there’s been an 85 percent growth in the daily use of the feature from over 8 million channels, and these additions might make Premieres useful in more scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubReQK"&gt;Premieres was designed to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490456/youtube-pre-recorded-videos-livestream-vidcon-2018"&gt;some of the benefits of YouTube live streams&lt;/a&gt; like live chat, but with the control of a pre-recorded and edited video. Creators typically use it to watch and respond to their subscribers while new videos debut. But as the pandemic has pushed film festivals and conventions online, Premieres’ use cases have grown. These new changes attempt to build on that momentum as online events become the norm by catering to some of the structure and marketing of traditional live events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MKQY6jpgUYBT3lBm6nmGr9nc04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137126/YTblog_BTSRedCarpet_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s simulated example of a live redirect from a BTS pre-show to a music video premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z0AGmC"&gt;The first of the new features is Live Redirect, which allows a creator with a premiere to hold a live stream prior to the video going live and automatically redirect viewers to it once it starts. YouTube imagines this filling the role of a pre-show or red carpet so viewers can learn and get excited about an upcoming video immediately before its release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIco6cU1ck0oXELaP7UqNSqXQ8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137138/YTblog_SetReminder_ClashRoyale_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a trailer advertising a premiere on its watch page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3mpOzS"&gt;The new optional Trailers are designed to fill in another pre-Premieres space, this time by looping a 15-second to three-minute video on an upcoming premiere’s watch page. Trailers could be used to advertise an upcoming premiere and entice potential viewers to set a reminder to tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esSVKL7PDsawMfFPXinDvXpTAiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137140/YTblog_CustomTimers_Mobile_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of countdown timer themes that creators will be able to choose from to lead into their premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wC7D51"&gt;The final new addition is the ability to customize the countdown timer that plays before a premiere with a Countdown Theme. YouTube says creators will be able to choose from a variety of “themes, vibes, and moods” so that the timer better matches the content of the video, rather than YouTube’s default style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oodeCd"&gt;YouTube says Live Redirect and Trailers will begin rolling out to eligible creators today, with Countdown Themes available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s bias hawk FCC nominee is one step closer to confirmation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FCC Repeals Net Neutrality Regulations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vINDju8dW4kGwekhfIGByfoqQ5g=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68371117/892773228.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vbZWdt"&gt;On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to advance the nomination of Nathan Simington, a Republican in favor of greater government oversight of speech on the internet, to the Federal Communications Commission. Simington’s nomination now awaits a floor vote for final approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONmarW"&gt;President Donald Trump nominated Simington to be the next Republican FCC Commissioner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438820/fcc-donald-trump-nominate-nathan-simington-commissioner-social-media-section-230-order"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;. If approved, Simington would fill Republican Commissioner Mike O’Rielly’s seat, leaving the agency at 2-2 deadlock when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;Chairman Ajit Pai steps down&lt;/a&gt; on January 20th. Without a Democratic majority at the FCC, the Biden administration will likely have difficulties rolling through any major policy measures until another nominee is vetted and approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51kKbQ"&gt;In August, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353233/orielly-fcc-nomination-withdrawn-trump-ligado-5g-230"&gt;abruptly withdrew&lt;/a&gt; O’Rielly’s renomination for an additional term at the FCC after the commissioner gave a speech opposing changes to Section 230, a hotly contested internet law the Trump administration has sought to repeal over the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bccnGI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This involvement to me sounds significant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sjASU5"&gt;Simington is viewed as a friend to the Trump administration’s desire to make changes to Section 230. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21431384/donald-trump-fcc-nomination-section-230-executive-order-bias-conservative?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; that Simington, a senior adviser at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), played a significant role in the agency’s social media regulation agenda. When Trump signed his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies"&gt;social media executive order&lt;/a&gt; in May, it required the NTIA to craft a petition that would call on the FCC to reinterpret Section 230. Simington confirmed to senators during his confirmation that he played a role in editing the petition and in public relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4aoNe"&gt;After Wednesday’s vote, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called out Republicans for “rushing to approve” Simington’s nomination. Blumenthal cited answers Simington provided to his office following the first confirmation hearing, suggesting that the Republican played a more significant role in the Trump administration’s social media agenda than he initially let on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52MhOG"&gt;“We have learned that he sought to enlist Fox News to quote ‘help get the FCC on board, more quickly and thereby ensure a freer and fairer social media landscape, going into the elections this fall’ end quote,” Blumenthal said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmSov3"&gt;“This involvement to me sounds significant and I do not support his nomination,” Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U9Vv0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn6UnK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discovery, home of Shark Week, HGTV, and Food Network, enters the streaming wars with Discovery Plus </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybBMxK4LnxXBA2BrkbHDCVJ2duU=/73x0:1510x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68366150/Screen_Shot_2020_12_02_at_12.42.40_PM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9YBmOu"&gt;Discovery, home to HGTV, Food Network, and Discovery Channel’s annual Shark Week, is entering the streaming space with Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLXTfv"&gt;Discovery Plus will start at $4.99 with an ad-supported tier, along with a $6.99 ad-free option. CNBC first &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/discovery-to-launch-streaming-service-in-january-for-4point99-per-month.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain"&gt;reported the news&lt;/a&gt;. The streaming service will launch on January 4th, 2021. The company aims to bring the service to more than 25 countries around the world over the next year. Each subscriber’s account will allow up to five different profiles, and four concurrent streams. The company’s press release does not note if Discovery Plus will offer content in 4K, but notes it will be available on “major platforms, including connected TVs, web, mobile, and tablets” at launch. Roku and Amazon are in negotiations right now to carry Discovery Plus, but deals have not been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbdEhp"&gt;As part of the roll out, Discovery is partnering with Verizon to give a number of the telecom company’s 55 million customers a free year of ad-free Discovery Plus. New and existing customers on Verizon’s “Play More or Get More Unlimited” plan will get a year of Discovery Plus free. Customers on “Start or Do More Unlimited” plans will receive six months free. On the internet side, new customers who sign up for Verizon 5G Home Internet or Fios Gigabit Connection will receive a year of free Discovery Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XqAkE4"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NTKx8c"&gt;The company’s collection of notable brands is likely what executives are banking on. CEO David Zaslav spoke about the company’s approach at a recent conference, as &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/discovery-to-unveil-global-streaming-service-strategy-on-dec-2"&gt;reported by The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “super fans” will want a place to watch their favorite personalities from their favorite shows on networks like HGTV (&lt;em&gt;Property Brothers&lt;/em&gt;) or the Food Network (Guy Fieri, Ina Garten) — and then some. There are also plans for original content that would be exclusively available on Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOzvvE"&gt;“We have been aggressively driving additional original content ... we think you need a substantial amount of original content,” Zaslav said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9oJEV"&gt;In an effort to make a competitive play in the space, Discovery has prepped a number of original series to entice people to sign up on top of fan favorites, and will launch with over 55,000 episodes of television. Original content will “premiere 52 weeks a year,” according to Zaslav. A full list of originals &lt;a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/here-are-all-the-original-series-coming-to-discovery-plus-in-2021"&gt;can be found on &lt;em&gt;The Streamable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but some of the exclusive originals that Discovery Plus will host include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rrzWxt"&gt;New &lt;em&gt;90 Day Fiance &lt;/em&gt;series, and home to the entire &lt;em&gt;90 Day Fiance &lt;/em&gt;universe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="emzYTz"&gt;A new &lt;em&gt;Long Island Medium &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RyvsMa"&gt;A new travel and food series starring Food Networks’ Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4VE3jn"&gt;New &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DsBg3P"&gt;A new series from Magnolia Network’s Chip and Joanna Gaines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="H03zNP"&gt;Discovery isn’t a mammoth conglomerate in the same way that many of its streaming competitors are (Disney, WarnerMedia, ViacomCBS, NBCUniversal), but niche streamers have found their places before. Crunchyroll, which caters to anime fans, has more than &lt;a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/07/28/crunchyroll-crosses-three-million-subscribers"&gt;3 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Shudder, a streamer dedicated to horror content, passed the &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/shudder-hits-1m-subscribers-as-key-part-of-amc-networks-targeted-streaming-approach-1234582104/"&gt;1 million paid subscribers mark&lt;/a&gt; this year. The WWE Network has &lt;a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/sec-and-other-documents/financials"&gt;more than 1.6 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9LbPK"&gt;Still, there’s no question that competition is tough, even for the biggest players. While Disney Plus may pass 100 million subscribers by the end of the year, and Netflix is likely past 200 million subscribers, new entrants like HBO Max and Peacock are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528234/hbo-max-subscribers-activations-att-directv-warner"&gt;seeing slower growth&lt;/a&gt;. Part of that has to do with newfound difficulties creating content this year because of the pandemic, but there are also concerns from analysts and experts that the space, especially within the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/22011750-83a7-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849"&gt;is oversaturated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n6V7j"&gt;In the year that every company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536842/streaming-disney-hbo-max-peacock-cbs-all-access-warnermedia-viacom-nbcuniversal"&gt;pivoted to streaming&lt;/a&gt;, however, it’s no surprise that corporations like Discovery are trying to find new ways to pull in subscribers and develop recurring revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eakh1X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 2nd 12:33pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story was updated to include additional information from the event. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mandalorian is the perfect Fortnite character</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0uaMnxb0Ruzy4bVw-ltaqJ6qEo=/384x0:3180x1864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68364890/Fortnite_20201202100316.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="my8bgx"&gt;Anyone who buys the battle pass for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;the new season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gets a nice initial bonus: a playable version of none other than the Mandalorian himself. He unlocks right away, and in many ways, he’s in keeping with the game’s recent strategy of focusing on branded tie-ins. Recent characters have included everyone from Wolverine to Travis Scott, Harley Quinn, and Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten. But Mando also differs from those others in one key way: he’s just about the perfect character for the battle royale game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW7wb4"&gt;At this point, it’s not a new idea to point out that &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/11/25/20978320/the-mandalorian-video-game-comparison-disney-plus-fetch-quest-armor-upgrade"&gt;often structured like a video game&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a story about a bounty hunter going out on a series of fetch quests; every time he asks for help, he’s tasked with going somewhere else to either collect an item or kill a monster. He’s basically an armored version of the Witcher. And often, he’ll be rewarded for his efforts with new gear, either in the form of stronger armor or maybe a fancy new spear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPTTY7"&gt;It turns out, this is a perfect fit for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s new bounty hunter-focused season. In the game’s continuously evolving fiction, the island is now overrun with the greatest hunters from various realities, all doing... something to stop the pull of a time-bending event that resulted from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;an attack by Marvel supervillain Galactus&lt;/a&gt;. It’s confusing, but it works well with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s quest structure, where you’re constantly tasked with new things in order to unlock more gear. There are even new bounties, where you can talk to NPCs or grab jobs from a bulletin board, asking you to kill a specific player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bq-euB_41WE6RcSYznVMmWNRpMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137155/Fortnite_20201202100942.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H2RN8q"&gt;Initially, Mando looks a bit rough. He isn’t the slick, shiny hunter he is in season 2 of the show. In order to get him to that point, you have to complete quests and slowly unlock new pieces of Beskar armor. It’s going to take a while. There are nine pieces to unlock, and one appears to only be available once you hit level 100. The same goes for Mando’s most important accessory: Grogu, better known as The Child or Baby Yoda, is available once you max out this season’s battle pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72JcT2"&gt;It’s a bit annoying that I’m going to have to wait so long to watch Grogu sip bone broth while I’m in the middle of a shootout. But I love that this version of the Mandalorian feels so true to the character: he has a lot of cool gear, but it requires plenty of effort to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
