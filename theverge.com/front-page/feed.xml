    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BTR7KZ"&gt;For those who have yet to nab a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, today Target is giving you another shot. The retailer listings are live for the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock"&gt;$399.99 PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. Target does their restocks early in the morning, where listings come online and read as “Sold out” before they go live and the Add to Cart button appears — which is any moment now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ihp6f8"&gt;To make sure you have the best chance at landing the console, make sure you’re signed into your Target account, with preloaded payment information, and double-check that your billing and shipping address is current. All of these steps won’t guarantee you’ll be able to get a console, but it will certainly reduce the time it takes to check out and possibly nab one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUUNRf"&gt;Also, as these Target orders are usually for in-store pickup, keep attempting to add items to the cart even if it initially fails when you click the button. Your local stores may load their available stock a few minutes later, or reload it in waves. Once you do manage to add it to your cart, be sure to checkout immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0MSo"&gt;If you don’t manage to get one today, don’t give up. Some members of our own team only managed to finally land their consoles of choice after repeated attempts. We will also continue posting updates as more restocks happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jBnOb"&gt;In the meantime, we’re happy to save you money on everyday purchases – which include the hottest video games, gaming peripherals, and more – so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Our team has also included some great gaming accessories below you can enjoy in the meantime as well, some of which are even on sale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eufy’s new video doorbell uses two cameras to catch porch pirates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k-i9nnZmX6InG3CGFG83N-ahN5o=/375x0:2625x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346347/eufy_doorbell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual uses two cameras to keep an eye on your front door.﻿&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YV40dq"&gt;Eufy, Anker’s smart home brand, is trying to solve the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;video doorbell’s&lt;/a&gt; biggest blindspot with a new dual-camera option. The Eufy Security Video Doorbell Dual has two cameras: a 2K camera up top to capture the face and body of a visitor and a 1080p camera down below to monitor packages left on the doorstep. At CES 2022 this week, the company also announced a new Garage Cam, which is a garage door controller and camera in one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL0wes"&gt;The concept of two cameras in a video doorbell is an interesting one, helping solve the problem most camera doorbells have where they either show you a tall, skinny video so you can see packages as well as people, but not much context outside that. Or, you get a wide view that gives more context but misses out on the doorstep itself, where those packages normally are. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuhX9PWGmta_8OEuHu1uDXMnBFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145629/eufy_Video_Doorbell_Dual___product_image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eufy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Dual is a battery-powered video doorbell with two cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="En1xM2"&gt;This Eufy Video Doorbell Dual, which costs $260, including the required Homebase 2 (a standalone version will also be available if you already have a hub), is not the first to attempt this type of two-camera solution. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetkuna.com%2Fproducts%2Fanswer-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kuna Maximus Answer&lt;/a&gt; also does double duty. However, that’s a hardwired doorbell; Eufy’s version is the first battery-powered buzzer to try this trick (Eufy says a hardwired version is also in the works). Its downward-facing 1080p camera has a 120-degree field of view, while the 2K camera can see as wide as 160 degrees. It also has AI that can detect packages, plus a new “Family Recognition” feature that uses AI to recognize friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlBYcT"&gt;In addition to dual cameras, the doorbell has dual motion detection, using radar and PIR technology to detect people versus motion and reduce false alerts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKwxTY"&gt;As with all Eufy cameras, there is no required monthly subscription fee. When paired with a Eufy hub — the HomeBase 2 — 16GB of local storage provides up to 90 days of video recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLaA2Z"&gt;The Eufy Dual should last up to six months on a charge, and based on my testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464940/eufy-anker-solocam-security-cameras-local-storage-battery-no-hub"&gt;Eufy cameras&lt;/a&gt; in the past, this battery life largely pans out. Although if you have a very busy front door, it’s more like four months. However, the addition of a second camera could have a significant impact on battery life. Prior &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.eufylife.com%2Fproducts%2Fe82101w3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy battery-operated doorbells&lt;/a&gt; could be used wired as well; we’ve asked the company if this is also the case with the Dual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hn6Omb"&gt;The Eufy Dual will work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Home&lt;/a&gt; smart home platforms and is scheduled to launch on February 8th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwUYR6oC1pOkYxUT7M5kB3cSDaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145622/Garage_Control_Cam.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eufy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Garage-Control Cam combines a garage door controller and camera into one device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5j9knQ"&gt;The other new product announced this week is the Eufy Security Garage-Control Cam and the Cam Plus. These are all-in-one garage control and surveillance devices that can be used to remotely open / close the garage door, as well as visually check in on your garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mSJXT"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam offers 1080p video and can control one door, and the Cam Plus has 2K video and can control up to two doors. They both pair with door sensors to detect the status of the door and send an alert if you forget to close it. The device also needs to be hardwired to your existing garage door opener, but details on which garage door manufacturers the product will be compatible with haven’t been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1duZ7d"&gt;As with other garage door controllers — such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chamberlain.com%2Fmyq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865803%2Feufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chamberlain’s MyQ &lt;/a&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://gotailwind.com/"&gt;Tailwind IQ3&lt;/a&gt; — the Garage-Control Cam lets you open and close your garage door remotely using the app or with voice control. Eufy also has the option of geofencing detection, so you can set the door to open or close as you arrive or leave home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTatIS"&gt;Both Cam devices can distinguish between humans, vehicles, and general motion using on-device AI, and they don’t require a Eufy hub. Instead, 32GB of local storage using an SD card provides video recordings with no monthly cloud storage fees. The cameras also support 24/7 continuous recording with a 4-second pre-roll feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx56hU"&gt;The Garage-Control Cam (1080P/ single-door control) will cost $99 and the Garage-Control Cam Plus (2K/ two-door control) $129, and both are expected to launch in March of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BUZJh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Thursday, January 6th, 7:30 AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Added details on the availability of a wired version of the Eufy Dual and a standalone version if you already have a hub. Also, clarified that the Garage-Control Cams need to be hardwired to a garage door controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IdMYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, Thursday, January 6th, 7:30 AM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; An earlier version of this article misstated the price of the Eufy Dual, it is expected to be $260. We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel announces 5.5Ghz capable 12th Gen CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elMZxwcD2czxXOi3YxQ2HEn3Vbw=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353821/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_10.44.35_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGgrSK"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866452/intel-amd-cpu-ces-2022-core-i9-12900ks-ryzen-processor"&gt;teasing the news earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Intel has officially announced a new 12th-gen desktop CPU that’s capable of boosting to 5.5GHz on a single core out of the box. The news came during &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRDkmmjvuM"&gt;Intel’s CES 2022 presentation&lt;/a&gt;, when it said the KS-series desktop processor would be shipping later this quarter, but there was no mention of pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qr5fna"&gt;The full name of the chip is the Core i9-12900KS, and &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-displays-core-i912900ks-with-55-ghz-boost-clock"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; the “S’’ suffix suggests it’ll be a limited edition. As well as hitting a maximum of 5.5GHz on a single core (a 300MHz improvement over what we saw with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763042/intel-core-i9-12900k-review"&gt;i9-12900K&lt;/a&gt;), an onstage demonstration of the new CPU powering &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; showed the processor running at a sustained 5.2GHz across all its performance cores. No details were given on what sort of power draw or cooling solution was needed to achieve these results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fOjHEobHLgKHT-mXW-ozEtDKtKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149335/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_10.44.35_AM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The processor was announced onstage during Intel’s CES presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YMo2Mu"&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn’t sound like you’ll be able to buy Intel’s 5.5GHz CPU for your own rig anytime soon. Intel executive vice president Gregory Bryant noted only that the CPU would be shipping to “OEM customers” during the presentation suggesting that, in the immediate future, you’ll have to buy a prebuilt PC to get your hands on one of the chips. As well as this new top-of-the-line CPU, Intel also used its CES presentation to announce a range of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866533/intel-12th-gen-cpu-alder-lake-mainstream-consumer-desktops-ces-2022"&gt;mainstream desktop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;laptop 12th Gen CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32zktFFnAMLjHdM6OpQD25akSMk=/0x0:1566x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353729/s22_lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the Galaxy S22 Ultra, S22 Plus, and S22.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Unbox Therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAWmRy"&gt;A video from Unbox Therapy has shown off what appears to be three dummy units of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S22 series of phones, giving an early look at the design of the handsets. Although the video has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qhk3Wfc3Ps"&gt;now been delisted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHJ34Bbu8OI"&gt;reuploaded on other channels&lt;/a&gt;, and a screenshot was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/05/galaxy-s22-size-leak-video/"&gt;taken by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The video emerged alongside other details of the upcoming phones, including camera specs, and images of a new fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUhauT"&gt;This isn’t the first time footage of Galaxy S22 dummy units has leaked online. Twitter leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1470530973712498692"&gt;OnLeaks posted similar footage&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of last month. Unbox Therapy’s video appears to corroborate these previous designs, and also shows the handsets more clearly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Do48z1"&gt;The three handsets shown in Unbox Therapy’s video are thought to be the S22 Ultra, the S22 Plus, and the regular S22, though these names may not be final. The S22 and S22 Plus appear to have similar designs to last year’s S21 devices, with camera bumps across the top left side of their backs. Both dummy units appear to have triple camera setups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWMgTH"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224"&gt;leaked spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; suggests the regular S22 will have a more compact 6.1-inch display (the S21, for reference, had a 6.2-inch display). This compares to a reported &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-design-renders-exclusive/"&gt;6.55-inch display for the S22 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Previous reports suggest &lt;a href="https://zouton.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s22-2021-exclusive-launch-edition-price-renders-design"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; will have a 50-megapixel main camera paired with extra ultra wide and telephoto cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgt6ft"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First Look at Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra / S22 Specs Sheet!   Introducing  SuperClear Lens!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/nyEFGrPtAH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nyEFGrPtAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zaryab Khan (@xeetechcare) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xeetechcare/status/1478674235916980224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NfK032"&gt;In line with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"&gt;previous leak from last month&lt;/a&gt;, the S22 Ultra appears to have a very Galaxy Note-style design, with a squared off top and bottom and a built-in holder for an S Pen stylus. There’s also no camera bump around the phone’s reported four cameras. A leaked spec sheet suggests these will consist of a primary 108-megapixel sensor, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto, and a 10-megapixel 10x periscope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DsWeo"&gt;Interestingly, the spec sheet mentions that this main 108-megapixel sensor could have a lens made of “Super Clear Glass,” which appears to be branding for some kind of Gorilla Glass. In an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orxS9qJsRkY&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;accompanying video&lt;/a&gt; to the spec sheet leak, Zaryab Khan speculates that this new lens could be designed to reduce the appearance of small bright dots that can appear in camera footage taken at night (a problem we’ve had &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/71m3SDGa220?t=760"&gt;with the iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, for example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdi283"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has shared images of what appears to be a fast-charger for the S22 Ultra. It’s 45W and has just a single USB-C charging port, which suggests we might be looking at an increase in charging speeds compared to the 25W S21 Ultra (Samsung previously offered 45W charging on the Note 10 Plus). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U3thqf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's that 45W PD Charger for your new S22 Ultra (EP-T4510)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the pic I posted a while back for this was obviously the wrong one. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jZw8Gu4Giq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jZw8Gu4Giq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1478702640355844096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="meDhOD"&gt;It’s currently unclear exactly when these phones might all be announced. Samsung launched the S21 series in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;mid-January last year&lt;/a&gt;, but has typically opted for February launches for previous lineups. Given ongoing supply chain issues and a global chip shortage, it’s anyone’s guess as to when the S22 handsets may eventually make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black + Decker’s $300 Bev vacuums up a Keurig-shaped hole in the robot bartender space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IeHs4igbtdXT-hIrQjsnfRvQn8Q=/2x0:4598x3064/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353256/bev_rendering_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ddnJ00"&gt;What if instead of coffee, your Keurig dispensed alcoholic drinks? Well, Keurig actually made a gadget like that — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/13/18088118/keurig-drinkworks-cocktail-pods-k-cup-beer-bar"&gt;a $300 cocktail-making pod machine called the Drinkworks Home Bar&lt;/a&gt; that turned disposable pods into cold beverages. Only Keurig and Anheuser-Busch &lt;a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/keurig-for-cocktails-abruptly-decides-to-shutter-operations/611684/"&gt;mysteriously shut down&lt;/a&gt; that venture just three weeks ago, going so far as to appoint a settlement administrator &lt;a href="https://www.drinkworksrefundprogram.com/home/documents/"&gt;to offer refunds&lt;/a&gt;. Which leaves a perfect space in the market for a competitor to step in: Black &amp;amp; Decker of dustbuster, power tool and small kitchen appliance fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GqmUC"&gt;The $300 Black + Decker Bev is coming this spring with what might be the most practical (and least stylish) take on the robot bartender yet. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/barsys-automated-cocktail-maker-review/"&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bartesian.com/products/the-bartesian"&gt;competitor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mixologiq.com/en/"&gt;I could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kolice-automatic-cocktail-bartender-universal/dp/B08R8PJ6X6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; on the web, it &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; looks like a low-end Keurig, only with five stainless steel straws to suck the alcohol out of five standard 750ml liquor bottles of your choice. No need for custom bottles, no need to turn the bottles upside-down and potentially make a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNKh96"&gt;You load it up with tequila, rum, vodka, gin and whiskey bottles, fill the water container, pop in a pod containing the juices and bitters, and hit a button corresponding to the desired strength of your drink. Then, an internal pump draws out digitally measured quantities of each liquid, uses pressure to shove them into the capsule and mix them, valves direct excess liquor back to each bottle uncontaminated, the drink pours into your glass, and the whole system flushes the pipes with air and water to clean itself out. The company says the whole process takes under 30 seconds. (The capsules do have something akin to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/5/7986327/keurigs-attempt-to-drm-its-coffee-cups-totally-backfired"&gt;Keurig-esque DRM&lt;/a&gt;, too: the machine scans a basic barcode to identify the capsule.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mn7hUI"&gt;Like with Keurig’s venture, Stanley Black &amp;amp; Decker (which also owns DeWalt, Craftsman and Porter-Cable) isn’t going it alone: it’s teamed up with Bartesian and uses that company’s existing pods (which cost $15 for a pack of six, each good for a single drink). Interestingly, the Bev comes in $50 less expensive than Bartesian’s current machine. Stanley Ventures &lt;a href="https://thespoon.tech/bartesian-raises-20m-series-a-for-its-countertop-cocktail-appliance/"&gt;also invested in Bartesian last year&lt;/a&gt;, and Black+Decker spokesperson Brooke Withers confirms that the company “is working with Bartesian to explore options for bringing the at-home craft cocktail experience to additional markets around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBEeIa"&gt;Newgadgets.de got a very quick look at the Bev on the CES 2022 show floor, and you can watch it embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OQzuOl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0W4Q3eM8Ls?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pdQWzF"&gt;In case you’re wondering, no, the Bev does not have a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi remote control, but the company says it does have a “party mode” with LEDs to light up the bottles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select iPad models go on sale quite regularly.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2aVlZ"&gt;Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find the most notable deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals available on each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting 64GB iPad with Wi-Fi by $30, which remains the steepest discount we’ve seen on the latest model. The same $30 discount also extends to the 256GB model with Wi-Fi, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91TLNJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in the silver colorway for $449&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F870975735&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart in either color&lt;/a&gt; for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"10 of the best Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22815442/iphone-ipad-best-games-apple-arcade-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen than its predecessor, along with a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has forfeited its 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and dedicated home button in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is, especially now that Apple and other retailers have officially discontinued selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, discounts on the sixth-gen Mini at Amazon are fairly limited. Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91LXFP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the 64GB model with Wi-Fi in select colorways&lt;/a&gt; for $494.00, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9LPNLG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model with Wi-Fi for $639.&lt;/a&gt; Most other retailers, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664337-REG%2Fapple_mk7m3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107515/1036?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals010521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, are selling the 2021 model at $499, its full retail price. Best Buy is also offering 30 percent off select mice, 15 percent off select keyboards, and a handful of other discounts with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase of either Wi-Fi-equipped configuration&lt;/a&gt;. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, however, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 41,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Walmart is selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229396/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals010521&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F462727496&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in multiple colorways for $539&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 11 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance at Best Buy in several Wi-Fi-equipped configurations and colors. Right now, the retailer is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmi02BD2dZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $809.99&lt;/a&gt; ($90 off), the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmi28RDHBK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $989.99&lt;/a&gt; ($110 off), and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjJQICs36o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB variant for $1,104.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,299.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799.

    <title>AMC Networks’ Sentai acquisition is the latest sign that anime is big business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cH-lC1uacMcl0VEh9-dnQucBkVE=/90x0:996x604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352937/FIX0Bg8XIAUSUxf.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As part of the deal, AMC Networks will own the anime streaming service Hidive, which has &lt;/em&gt;Lupin the 3rd&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sentai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aHk2zr"&gt;AMC Networks (not the movie theater chain) has acquired the anime distributor Sentai from the Cool Japan Fund investment fund, &lt;a href="https://www.amcnetworks.com/press-releases/amc-networks-acquires-leading-global-anime-distributor-sentai-including-direct-to-consumer-anime-platform-hidive/"&gt;the company announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the deal, AMC Networks will now own the anime-focused streaming service Hidive, which will join the company’s roster of targeted streaming services that already includes AMC Plus, Acorn TV, Shudder, Sundance Now, and ALLBLK. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2A6G5"&gt;The acquisition is the latest signal of the growing importance of anime content to entertainment companies. Perhaps the most notable anime push was Sony’s $1.175 billion purchase of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617356/sony-crunchyroll-att-funimation-acquisition"&gt;anime streaming service Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; from AT&amp;amp;T, which brought Crunchyroll and another anime streaming giant, Funimation, under one roof. But other companies have also been beefing up their anime offerings; Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527983/netflix-geeked-week-anime-trailers-mobile-suit-gundam-godzilla"&gt;a huge slate of anime series&lt;/a&gt;, while Disney was willing to make an anime anthology series of one of its biggest franchises: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/22684843/star-wars-visions-anime-anthology-disney-plus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is doing great, according to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/StipGqIgGVVr1QwQ-4LfUd8v_Ww=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352645/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PMtWzM"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s latest subscriber figures make it seem like HBO and its sister service HBO Max are doing pretty well — great, even! In a &lt;a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/atnt2/sec/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&amp;amp;FilingId=15462042&amp;amp;CIK=0000732717&amp;amp;Index=10000"&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt; this week, AT&amp;amp;T revealed that it beat its projected year-end goal with 73.8 million total subscribers between HBO and HBO Max (even after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738967/hbo-max-subscriptions-q3-2021-amazon-exit"&gt;breakup with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;). Not too bad, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83dm4C"&gt;But that win comes after a year of highly anticipated movie debuts meant to balloon subscriber numbers, and it’s still tens of millions of subscribers behind rivals like Disney Plus and Netflix. The numbers also come with some pretty big caveats. In other words, hold the applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yogjgp"&gt;For one, AT&amp;amp;T’s figures (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/global/hbo-max-2021-subscriber-att-warnermedia-1235147025/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;) conflate two separate services — HBO, its cable business, and HBO Max, its streaming service — and they don’t distinguish how many subscribers each service has individually. WarnerMedia spokesperson Jaclyn Mandelbaum told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that more information “will be broken out in AT&amp;amp;T’s earnings in a couple weeks” but declined to specify figures for each service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CEJD0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2021 should’ve been HBO Max’s year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH0iOr"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s growth also looks less impressive given the high-profile content slate it served over the last year, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, and the third season of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;. On top of that, HBO Max added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444063/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-announced-pricing-release-date"&gt;lower-priced tier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;launched internationally&lt;/a&gt; partway through the year — both of which should have helped boost its subscribers substantially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VaM2I"&gt;Disney Plus added more than twice as many subscribers over a similar time period. Disney’s streaming service, which launched roughly six months before HBO Max, reported &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2021/"&gt;118.1 million paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of October 2021, up from &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-hits-86-8-million-subscribers-1234850846/"&gt;73.7 million&lt;/a&gt; about a year earlier. HBO’s 73.8 million record, on the other hand, is only up from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/q4_earnings_2020.html"&gt;61 million subscribers globally&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDW2u6"&gt;Streaming data is virtually impossible to tackle on a one-for-one comparison level for myriad reasons, not the least of which being that everyone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;playing by different rules&lt;/a&gt;. That’s to say nothing of how piracy, account-sharing, and features like auto-play can significantly skew a truly accurate picture of subscriber and title success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXRAWN"&gt;Last year should’ve been HBO Max’s year to win. It’s going to have to find new ways to grow without the help of a highly anticipated day-and-date slate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s latest deal could mean its videos are coming to waiting room TVs near you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/21mMS0vJCIf1p1yPMYQQ8qPmaFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352625/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWkndV"&gt;TikTok has already conquered our phones and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796353/tiktok-tv-app-now-available-samsung-lg-google-android-tv"&gt;TVs at home&lt;/a&gt;, but its next target will ensure you really can’t escape from cute pet videos, impressive feats, and oddly satisfying clips. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/press/atmosphere-integrates-tiktok"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the popular short-form video platform has partnered with &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/"&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;, a startup that drums up the content to ambiently play in the background when you’re eating at a restaurant, lounging in a hotel, or sitting in a waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VQoqI"&gt;Atmosphere already delivers content to places like Taco Bell, Texas Roadhouse, Burger King, and even Meineke, letting clients choose from a number of “channels” that suit different environments. And now, &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/press/atmosphere-integrates-tiktok"&gt;TikTok will get a channel dedicated&lt;/a&gt; to curated videos from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="peujDB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Atmosphere essentially repurposes the videos it gathers, whether it’s from YouTube or TikTok&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="icYqsj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; says that Atmosphere essentially repurposes the videos it gathers, whether it’s from YouTube or TikTok. It then removes the audio, adds its own music (or potentially leaves it audio-less, since some venues keep their TVs on mute), slaps on a caption, and subsequently adds it to the stream of videos that make up a specific channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mLqjl"&gt;The lack of audio means you won’t be able to hear the trendy jingles you typically hear on a TikTok video (but maybe that’s for the best). As for how the creators behind the videos get compensated, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes that Atmosphere gets creators’ permission and works out a deal — it even gets some of its content for free, as the company essentially promotes creators by playing their videos in public areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI3RPR"&gt;You can check out what the TikTok channel might look like &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/channels/tiktok"&gt;in a demo on Atmosphere’s site&lt;/a&gt;. The stream shows TikTok videos organized by hashtag, like #lifeisrandom and #coolrunning, which is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. Atmosphere also added its own music and set the videos against animated backgrounds. Creators’ usernames remain visible in each video, albeit probably tough to read from far away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Fraggle Rock reboot looks like it will stay true to the original series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUyEv1Id0bbESAfJb4wiFjEHK1k=/0x114:2190x1574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352534/010522_Fraggle_Rock_Back_Rock_Debut_Big_Image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zN4u7t"&gt;Apple released a new trailer for its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; Apple TV Plus reboot on Wednesday (officially titled &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&lt;/em&gt;), and it seems like the new series will be bringing back all of the hallmarks of the original show. The new trailer features charming puppets, a catchy song, and a dumb joke to kick things off that I actually found kind of funny, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H21eTqk9BP8"&gt;watch it all here&lt;/a&gt;. The 13-episode series debuts on January 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQNOI4"&gt;Apple TV Plus has become something of a destination for &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt;. In April 2020, the company debuted the first in a series of shorts called &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&lt;/em&gt;, and in May 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271931/fraggle-rock-apple-tv-plus-new-series-licensed-strategy"&gt;acquired past seasons of the original show&lt;/a&gt;. (Seems like someone over at Apple is a &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; fan. Maybe Tim Cook?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnzBAT"&gt;The new series joins Apple TV Plus’ growing lineup of original shows geared toward children, which also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887382/apple-tv-plus-kids-trailers-content-snoopy-sesame-street-ghostwriter-helpsters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Harriet the Spy,&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;Ghostwriter&lt;/em&gt; reboot, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873176/apple-tv-plus-helpsters-ghostwriter-trailers-childrens-shows"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helpsters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
