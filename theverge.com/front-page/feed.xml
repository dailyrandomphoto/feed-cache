        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, some retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ref_US_EBF21_P1_GW_Desk_DealsSingle_DOTD_ENES=&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=3488afaa-3745-41ec-bed9-8c643eff58e9&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=JWNIH&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=2DJTCZEMSEHW2K3CCY8Y&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=gdIC3&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=652b3660-a90a-45ff-b04c-3e93a23460c4&amp;amp;ref_=pd_gw_unk"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1, and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=44&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=43&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLLL2o"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzQ1NzMzL2Jlc3Qtbm9pc2UtY2FuY2VsaW5nLWhlYWRwaG9uZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb052c11d"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, are currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for their lowest price to date&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $350, this deal brings these cans down to $248. Along with industry-leading noise cancellation, our reviewer Chris Welch particularly liked the improved voice quality and the addition of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. These over-ear headphones can last up to 30 hours on a single charge, too, and provide a comfortable listening experience with plush ear pads. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzU2MzEzL3NvbnktMTAwMHhtNC1ub2lzZS1jYW5jZWxpbmctaGVhZHBob25lcy1yZXZpZXctcHJpY2Utc3BlY3MtZmVhdHVyZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6a37a9ea"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KvuUT7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in white for $235. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyI5ia"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is a smart 4K monitor that acts like a TV for your PC, one you can mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $520, its best price to date, with a solar-powered remote control. The monitor can stream HDR10 content from popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2. It also supports Google Assistant and Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j22lU8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;). The retailer is also taking more than 50 percent off the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-Indoor-Security-Camera-Detection/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last year’s Fire HD 8 tablets&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WplKkW"&gt;Both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDYPWK7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are selling for $40 right now instead of $60, which is a good deal on what we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;recently praised&lt;/a&gt; as an amazing action game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u3IApI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $190 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $188 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning Best Buy will refund the difference in price of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nl3yNN"&gt;Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts on LG’s C1 OLED&lt;/a&gt; as Amazon, but is also adding other perks in addition to the six-month subscription to HBO Max. These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iY7ZPM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzQ1NzMzL2Jlc3Qtbm9pc2UtY2FuY2VsaW5nLWhlYWRwaG9uZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb052c11d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $350. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzU2MzEzL3NvbnktMTAwMHhtNC1ub2lzZS1jYW5jZWxpbmctaGVhZHBob25lcy1yZXZpZXctcHJpY2Utc3BlY3MtZmVhdHVyZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6a37a9ea" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $190.

If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $119 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BQTBGw"&gt;If you’re looking for a smart speaker, Best Buy is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUCWHFwCy2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Audio for nearly half off&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $100, the retailer currently has it for $60 instead. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTAxMzAwL2dvb2dsZS1uZXN0LWF1ZGlvLWFzc2lzdGFudC1zbWFydC1zcGVha2VyLXJldmlldy1wcmljZS1zcGVjcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B30e88024" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert praised the Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for being a notable improvement over the original Google Home in every way. It touts improved audio quality, it’s faster at registering Google Assistant queries, and you can easily pair two of them together for stereo sound. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxNTAxMzAwL2dvb2dsZS1uZXN0LWF1ZGlvLWFzc2lzdGFudC1zbWFydC1zcGVha2VyLXJldmlldy1wcmljZS1zcGVjcy1mZWF0dXJlcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C30e88024" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0cXUQh"&gt;Best Buy is also selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWe6PKFYjN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; for its best price to date in select colors and sizes. The 40mm black version with GPS, for example, is currently going for $199 instead of $250. The Galaxy Watch 4 is Samsung’s first device to run the new Wear OS 3 platform that Google and Samsung &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvNy8yMi8yMjU4ODQ0MC9nb29nbGUtd2Vhci1vcy0zLXVwZGF0ZS1zbWFydHdhdGNoLXNhbXN1bmctMjAyMg/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B790b9543" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have been working on together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNjI5NDU5L2dhbGF4eS13YXRjaC00LWNsYXNzaWMtcmV2aWV3LWJpeGJ5LWdvb2dsZS13ZWFyb3M/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb90406be" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how much we enjoyed using the watch when paired with a Samsung phone, praising its performance, improved third-party app support, and expansive health tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lSb0VK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848015"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL6nXD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KJVtaJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max have been available for less, but the cheapest place to get them right now is at Best Buy, where you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkuem3dVe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a pair in any color for $479&lt;/a&gt;, $70 off the regular MSRP. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ysr84c"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which allows you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jv2SvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptops 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNqjUh"&gt;First off, the Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,200&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt;, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great, and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="KJNFBG"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th, and has been running similar deals every week since. The retail store also officially launched its weekly &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Holiday Best” deals&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, which run every Sunday online and in-store. Target RedCard holders can save an additional 5 percent while enjoying free shipping, and the store will be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="69Dp0C"&gt;Target is currently offering Black Friday deals &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/ZdB3AQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on TVs from LG, Samsung, TCL, and more&lt;/a&gt;. The store is also offering the same discount on various sizes of the LG C1 and Samsung’s The Frame as Amazon, and including a six-month subscription to HBO Max as well. However, as we mentioned before, Target RedCard members are also eligible for a five percent discount, which means they could buy the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1176910/2092?subId1=VergeDeals102921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-48-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled48c1%2F-%2FA-82219816%3Fclkid%3D64ecedacN58e711ea9b2c42010a246e0c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch LG C1 for $1,045&lt;/a&gt; instead of the discounted $1,100 Amazon currently offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RmYUbz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lV9ukd"&gt;Alternatively, Target RedCard members can pick up the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/9WOv9y" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch version of The Frame&lt;/a&gt;, which has an MSRP of $1,300, for $853 instead of the discounted $898. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VYKZW4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847926"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ITUAT"&gt;Like Amazon and Best Buy, Target is also &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/15REQB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting Sony’s $350 WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzQ1NzMzL2Jlc3Qtbm9pc2UtY2FuY2VsaW5nLWhlYWRwaG9uZXM/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bb052c11d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;. However, RedCard members can also get a five percent discount, which means you’d be paying $238 instead of the $250 sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="44w5fy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is currently selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7moVRr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $180 through November 6th, which beats Amazon’s all-time low of $199. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKPeGe"&gt;Also on the TV front, Target is taking $350 off the 65-inch version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/donjWq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Element’s affordable, frameless Roku TV&lt;/a&gt; through November 6th. Normally $650, the TV is currently on sale for $300, more than half off the original price. The 4K Ultra HD TV is compatible with HDR10, offers a 60Hz native refresh rate, and has four HDMI ports. It also supports Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, while additionally working with Chromecast and Apple’s AirPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W2j4hz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10834759"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/YgB3Am" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now through November 6th, a cool $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2XWmQV"&gt;Target is offering up to 60 percent off &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9QDKd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;select video games&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles through November 6th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mo7Agr"&gt;Like Best Buy, Target is also selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/RymJDN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for $60 instead of $100 until November 7th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;The retailer is also selling a silver version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/a12Qob" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S. Mode&lt;/a&gt; for $340 instead of $540 through November 6th. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue supercenter recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire as soon as November 7th. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;While many of these deals aren’t live yet, we’ve collected a handful that piqued our interest below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $59&lt;/a&gt; until November 7th. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The GoPro Hero 8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart will be offering the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q7R0XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwKlAu"&gt;One of our favorite budget tablets from last year just got a little cheaper. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Tab-A7-32GB-10-4-Wi-Fi-Gray-SM-T500NZABXAR%2F882296471" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;going to be on sale at Walmart for $140&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. This brings it well below the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, which features 32GB of internal storage and a 10.4-inch display. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were with the vibrant display and sturdy build quality of this unassuming tablet. It’s not going to rival, say, the latest iPad Air or Mini, but it remains a solid entertainment device, especially if you plan to consume Amazon content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UxwtI2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wijGQu"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip, and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTGFc4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzgh35"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is selling the popular action cam for $450 instead. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0mioxN"&gt;The retailer is also discounting camera accessories, like Sony’s $1,098 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1126140-REG%2Fsony_sel90m28g_fe_90mm_f_2_8_macro.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SE 90mm macro lens&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $998.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Honeywell Home’s T9 smart thermostat gets HomeKit support, finally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ja5VDB3HLz37ogW4KpUaRykGvEE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102858/dseifert_190705_3501_5339.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honeywell Home T9 smart thermostat will now work with Siri and Apple HomeKit.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IxKEaj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703744/honeywell-home-t9-thermostat-review-remote-sensors-price-specs-features"&gt;Honeywell Home T9&lt;/a&gt;, Resideo’s first consumer thermostat to support remote temperature sensors, has finally brought a long-promised feature to its users: HomeKit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT4s7I"&gt;The brand, which is licensed by Resideo and spun out of Honeywell in 2018, already has support for Apple’s smart home system in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/27/13075062/honeywell-thermostat-smart-connected-lyric-t5"&gt;T5 thermostat, also known as Lyric T5&lt;/a&gt;, but that device doesn’t have external sensors. Sensors can help make sure you’re comfortable in the room you’re in, rather than just maintaining the desired temperature where the thermostat is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjSIJr"&gt;As&lt;em&gt; Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Dan Seifert wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703744/honeywell-home-t9-thermostat-review-remote-sensors-price-specs-features"&gt;in his review of the Honeywell T9&lt;/a&gt;, its sensors are very good and able to measure humidity in addition to temperature, something neither Nest nor Ecobee’s remote sensors can do. They can also sense motion and presence and will adjust the system to rooms where it detects people. The &lt;a href="https://www.resideo.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/wifi-thermostats/rcht9610wfsw2003-u-t9-smart-thermostat-with-sensor-rcht9610wfsw2003-u/"&gt;T9 costs $199&lt;/a&gt; and comes with one remote sensor in the box, with support for up to 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDU9P2"&gt;According to Resideo, with the HomeKit integration, users can control their Honeywell Home T9 smart thermostat using Siri or with the Apple Home app. Once connected, you can use automations to adjust the temperature or ask Siri to do it for you. Unlike with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22720890/siri-voice-control-ecobee-smart-thermostats"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt;, there is no built-in voice assistant, so you need to use a HomePod Mini, iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch to invoke the assistant. Resideo didn’t specify if you’ll be able to use temperature or motion from the sensors to trigger routines in the  Home app. The Honeywell Home T9 already has support for Amazon Alexa and Google Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7HkRu"&gt;Whether this really matters, considering smart thermostats are in the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter specification&lt;/a&gt; (the new smart home standard that promises to unify connected devices in our home), remains to be seen. Resideo is on the board of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance,&lt;/a&gt; which oversees Matter, so it seems likely its thermostats will become Matter-enabled when the standard launches next year. This should mean users can control their thermostat with any smart home ecosystem of their choice, as long as it supports Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bequ7m"&gt;But in the meantime, T9 owners will be able to keep their toes toasty this holiday season with just a few words to their Apple voice assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InVWuN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing’s new turnip price tracker doesn’t tell you the most important thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O2KwkW-VE4xrRTBRVc-BYTW3f1k=/25x0:1102x718/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102800/IMG_1323.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Turnip Tracker isn’t showing today’s price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s31Bxz"&gt;Nintendo quietly added a turnip price tracker for &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;to the Nintendo Switch Online app, but it’s not as useful as I was hoping. Disappointingly, the tracker doesn’t show the current turnip price on your island. Instead, it lists historical prices over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NV0UX"&gt;To see the tracker, which is cleverly dubbed the Turnip Tracker, you’ll need to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. If you are, open the Nintendo Switch Online app, tap the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;icon, tap the “Island Newspaper” on the list of NookLink apps, and scroll down to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXKgDK"&gt;Below is an image of what the tracker looks like on my iPhone 12 Mini, taken as I was writing this article. You can see it’s missing the current price and the morning’s price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1KZj34NWVxZcpGP79T02aKExMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22990021/IMG_1323.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s been a bad week for turnip prices on my island.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s1ezVb"&gt;I had really hoped the Turnip Tracker would let me check my island’s turnip price without having to boot up my Switch, but I guess I’m still going to have to do that for an up-to-the-minute picture of the stalk market. Fortunately, there’s a lot of good reasons to play &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; right now, thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765536/animal-crossing-new-horizons-2-0-update"&gt;jam-packed new update&lt;/a&gt;, so stopping by Nook’s Cranny every once in a while shouldn’t be too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, your Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro can be MagSafe-friendly with this Moment case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhnDp0sypwlk5vjmT5IbaSogRzA=/403x490:5654x3991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102491/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment has a whole ecosystem of accessories that will now work with the Pixel 6, thanks to its new M(force) case.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Moment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJACZV"&gt;Your dangerously slippery Pixel 6 or 6 Pro just arrived, and you’re scrambling to find an available case that will protect your new baby. Whether you are a MagSafe-curious Pixel owner or recently ditched your iPhone for the Pixel but have some MagSafe accessories you don’t want to waste, Moment’s (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the bridge to more platform agnostic mobile accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ei1Rb"&gt;As a mobile accessory maker, Moment embraces the idea that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22417836/moment-magsafe-iphone-camera-accessories-review-price-features-specs"&gt;ecosystem of lenses and mounts for content creators&lt;/a&gt; should be compatible with different phone brands and models. After all, each case is compatible with Moment’s catalog of accessories that shares the same mount design — just like the way camera lenses work with various camera bodies. This is not the first time that Moment has made a cross-platform case: earlier this year, the company released some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fgalaxy-thin-case-m-force%2FS21-ultra-5g-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-compatible cases for the Samsung Galaxy S21s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbZ6dn"&gt;According to Alec Ploof who is in charge of partnerships at Moment, the thought process to make its cases compatible with MagSafe was simple: “We included our proprietary M(Force) magnets into all of the Moment cases we made for iPhone 11, 12, &amp;amp; 13, so we figured to also include them in our new Pixel 6 or Samsung S21 cases to also make these devices compatible with our MagSafe mounting products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhyFs7Qe1cZa8SVGtGPrPpxDu1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989736/P6_Pro_3_Front.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment’s case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force has an array of 36 magnets that help MagSafe accessories attach to the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhwhAroeCg3z1lFRPrR2c79fBtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989743/P6_Pro_1_Back.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike Moment’s other cases which feature wood or canvas panels, the (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is made of textured polycarbonate and TPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqOnHi"&gt;Unlike Moment’s previous cases that feature wood and canvas panels, there is just one case design for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s case with (M)Force. It’s all black and made of a textured and a “grippy material” called high-strength polycarbonate and TPU. Its three-layer exterior should protect your Pixel 6 from up to six-foot drops and even has a provision for a wrist strap (sold separately). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mB1209"&gt;On the inside is a layer of premium microfiber liner that wraps around your Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, as well as an array of 36 of Moment’s proprietary (M)Force magnets. Those magnets are equivalent to about 15lbs of force, so your MagSafe accessory should be able to attach easily yet securely to your Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxaowMFWrVtDjSkWqkQHutEX60M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989835/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1134.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moment case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force, attached to the Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CeZL9W"&gt;Not only will this Moment case with (M)Force work with its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-pro-tripod-mount-for-magsafe%2Fpro-portrait-landscape&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, it will be able to charge wirelessly with any battery that is Qi- and MagSafe-compatible. This means your Pixel 6 might just be able to make use of other Qi- and MagSafe-friendly accessories out there, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744362/anker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile"&gt;Anker’s adorable 8-in-1 637 Magnetic Charging Station&lt;/a&gt;. Just don’t expect to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;15W fast charging from Apple’s official MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj6ZX1"&gt;Both (M)Force cases for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are available now on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-case-for-pixel-6%2F6-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moment’s website for $50&lt;/a&gt;. While the Pixel 6 case is currently in stock, the Pixel 6 Pro case won’t ship until December 4th due to the global supply shortage. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4TU6Z"&gt;The FBI is &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2021/PSA211104"&gt;warning people of a new breed of scam&lt;/a&gt; involving cryptocurrency ATMs. A con artist convinces a person to put cash into a cryptocurrency ATM and send the purchased coins to the scammer using an address stored in a QR code (&lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/fbi-warns-of-scams-using-crypto-atms-and-qr-codes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While the actual scamming is relatively low-tech, it’s an interesting misuse of technology and shows how criminals are using crypto to “improve” on old methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c55E9J"&gt;As the agency describes it, the scammer will contact their victim and somehow convince them that they need to send money, either with promises of love, further riches, or by impersonating an actual institution like a bank or utility company. After the mark is convinced, the scammer will have them get cash (sometimes out of investment or retirement accounts), and head to an ATM that sells cryptocurrencies and supports reading QR codes. Once the victim’s there, they’ll scan a QR code that the scammer sent them, which will tell the machine to send any crypto purchased to the scammer’s address. Just like that, the victim loses their money, and the scammer has successfully exploited them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vXpwJ9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scammers are using tech to upgrade old tricks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RHqlSR"&gt;If this scam sounds familiar, it may be because it’s basically just a tech twist on &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/before-you-wire-money#why%20scammers%20want%20you%20to%20wire%20money"&gt;wire transfer fraud&lt;/a&gt;. Through whatever means, someone will convince their victim to send them money, and then have them do so using a method that’s difficult to trace, and almost impossible to undo. Like with wire transfers, the system is working as designed — being able to use a QR code instead of having to type in a long wallet address is something that’s handy for legitimate crypto purchases, too. It’s just that instead of going to your wallet, the funds are going to somebody else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eBPZw"&gt;The “upgrade” (as it were) for scammers with the crypto ATM method is two-fold: it can be less friction than sending a wire transfer, and at the end the scammer has cryptocurrency instead of fiat. With wire transfers, you have to fill out a form, and you may give that form to an actual person (who could potentially vibe check you). Using the ATM method, there’s less time to reflect on the fact that you’re about to send money to a stranger. And, if you’re a criminal trying to get your hands on Bitcoin, you won’t have to teach your targets how to buy coins on the internet and transfer them to another wallet — they probably already know how to use an ATM and scan a QR code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKHDax"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2021/PSA211104"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/before-you-wire-money#why%20scammers%20want%20you%20to%20wire%20money"&gt;FTC&lt;/a&gt; have some good guidelines on how to avoid getting scammed, but what they really boil down to is this: if someone you don’t know is asking you to send them money, don’t do it using any method, crypto or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google removes its algorithmic ‘Your News Update’ from Assistant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fuauzd0xNg-u9NJjauplH_BrgEg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102117/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-8.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dguwI8"&gt;Google has quietly removed its “Your News Update” feature from Assistant, axing the algorithmically personalized audio digest in favor of the company’s existing (and more traditional) news briefings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/05/google-assistant-your-news-update/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgQTbX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20972336/google-assistant-audio-news-feed-algorithm"&gt;Originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Your News Update was an attempt at bringing the same kinds of algorithmic feeds that had been so successful on Facebook or other areas of Google’s products to audio news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeVBm1"&gt;Instead of users picking their three specific new sources (like NPR, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, or CNN), Your News Update would rely on Google’s wealth of personal data to offer far more specific and relevant news updates from a broad range of partners that Google was licensing news from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyibrR"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn pointed out at the time of release, the issue with that kind of system is that it relies on being very, very accurate, especially for audio — where you have to listen through each news story, which is far more time consuming than a text-based version. Plus, as anyone who’s used Google’s algorithmic headline feature in its apps lately knows, Google’s guesses at what you’re interested in can be pretty hit or miss. And of course, there was the same issue with algorithmic feeds here as anywhere else on the internet — that of falling into a self-selected bubble of filtered news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i0LRD"&gt;There’s no official word from Google as to why it’s deprecated the feature, so we may never know for sure the reasoning behind Google abandoning it to its ever-increasing product graveyard. Google Assistant still offers its original news digest option, however, so users won’t be left in the lurch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fixes bug that could cause macOS Monterey to brick Macs with a T2 security chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Apple MacBook Air" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6_98URhHffSHEz69GzapRBq7IU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102063/vpavic_4291_20201113_0411.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6z6zGs"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744497/macos-12-monterey-apple-mac-download-available-now"&gt;macOS Monterey was released&lt;/a&gt;, there have been several Apple users who said that installing the update bricked their computers. It was unclear what might have caused the issue until today, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1456672355992866816"&gt;Rene Ritchie reports&lt;/a&gt;, he has received this statement from Apple citing an issue with the firmware of its T2 security chip (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/05/apple-rolls-out-fix-for-macos-monterey-bug-that-bricked-some-macs-with-the-t2-chip/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="V2k1Qg"&gt;We have identified and fixed an issue with the firmware on the Apple T2 security chip that prevented a very small number of users from booting up their Mac after updating macOS. The updated firmware is now included with the existing macOS updates. Any users impacted by this issue can contact Apple Support for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0xVEQS"&gt;There aren’t any specifics on the models affected, possible settings or configurations that are vulnerable, or exactly what a “small number of users” adds up to. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/macos-monterey-bricking-older-macs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was able to find tweets from at least nine MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac owners who said their devices didn’t boot up after the update. It’s good that they can reach out to Apple Support for assistance, but it’s also unclear if those people will be able to retain any data locked in affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wanj1N"&gt;The T2 security chip has appeared in a number of Apple computers (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862"&gt;you can check the list here&lt;/a&gt;) since it was introduced in 2018. Apple says that updated firmware to eliminate the issue is now included in existing macOS updates (some trackers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iOSReleases/status/1456669546945916935"&gt;noted a refreshed version of the BridgeOS 6.0 software&lt;/a&gt; that runs on the T2 going out today), so it shouldn’t be an issue on any of those machines from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is hosting an education-focused event on November 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ujswkIGyhKeJ90ss8VnmfZI-YY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101981/vpavic_210930_4784_0064.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft just launched the affordable Surface Go 3, but maybe it will reveal new hardware at an education-focused event on Tuesday.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ibw7yM"&gt;Microsoft is hosting an event next week focused on education technology. It’s taking place November 9th at 12PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31wHJq"&gt;Details are light, but here’s &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/reimagine-education-2021/"&gt;Microsoft’s description of the event&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AQ32AL"&gt;Join us at 9 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Nov. 9, as we share an inside look at the latest tech solutions while examining gaps in learning left by the pandemic. Hear from Microsoft partners, school leaders and a few special guests, and learn about new and existing technology from Microsoft Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Slw1HM"&gt;The event arrives just over a month after the company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;Windows 11, its next major operating system&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the company will detail upcoming education-focused updates on the way for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLNENe"&gt;Microsoft’s vague hint about “new and existing technology” indicates we could see new hardware revealed at the event as well. The company just revealed a wave of new Surface products at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;an event in September&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe the company isn’t done introducing new hardware in 2021 just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some new BMWs won't have touchscreens thanks to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EbAFHA5qmrUhp9pp1jzOCf6UFv4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101745/BMW_MY22_3Series_Tech_Carousel_03_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HiuAQs"&gt;BMW is dropping touchscreens from many of its new cars due to the chip shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bimmerfest.com/threads/major-option-restriction-announcement.1420312/"&gt;forum post on BimmerFest&lt;/a&gt; and later confirmed by the car company to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Fyour-new-bmw-might-not-have-a-touchscreen.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765709%2Fbmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edmunds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/05/bmws-losing-touchscreen-functionality/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AutoBlog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While we’ve seen other auto manufactures have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv"&gt;pause production&lt;/a&gt; or cut other features, this omission is a big deal — nowadays, touchscreens are a fairly standard feature in cars, and not having one will affect how you interact with the car almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LA3oqI"&gt;According to the BimmerFest post, some affected vehicles (which include the 3 Series sedans, and X5, X6, and X7 SUVs / crossovers) will also lose access to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAWycJA1r4"&gt;backup assistant feature&lt;/a&gt; as well, which automatically backs into spots for you after recording how you drove through them going forward. The post also says that cars shipped without touchscreens will come with a $500 credit and will require both a software update and the customer to sign a form with the dealer to acknowledge that they know about the feature deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5oocp"&gt;Instead of the touchscreen, users will have to rely on a controller in the center console, which features touchpad-like abilities. It’s a divisive input option between reviewers, but I doubt most people would choose it over the touchscreen under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GfZssJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oCXwjqQ7P4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tiFbIA"&gt;What’s worse is that, practically speaking, you probably won’t be able to get a touchscreen installed after the fact with the $500 you’re saving from the deletion. At this point, then, it may be best to just try and wait it out — while the chip shortage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;is expected to last until at least 2023&lt;/a&gt;, cars are often a long-term purchase. Do you really want to be using a touchpad instead of a touchscreen in, say, 2030?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWw8X"&gt;BMW isn’t the only company making cuts to its vehicles to deal with shortages — GM has dropped features as well, from the relatively innocuous like &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41307/gm-pulls-hd-radio-from-2021-silverado-and-sierra-pickups-over-chip-shortage"&gt;HD radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;built-in wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; on some models to serious omissions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;fuel management modules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/41008/gm-drops-auto-stop-start-from-v8-silverados-and-sierras-due-to-chip-shortage"&gt;auto stop-start&lt;/a&gt; on some of its V8s and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;much-touted Super Cruise hands-free driving mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US has big, new plans to pull CO2 out of the air</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World’s Largest Carbon-Sucking Plant Starts Making Tiny Dent in Emissions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5D6pwELgrKzVkXoGmE8VFHLVe4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101735/1235138673.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Collector containers at the ‘Orca’ direct air capture and storage facility, operated by Climeworks AG, in Hellisheidi, Iceland, on Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021. Startups Climeworks and Carbfix are working together to store carbon dioxide removed from the air deep underground to reverse some of the damage CO2 emissions are doing to the planet. | Arnaldur Halldorsson/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Nk9uk"&gt;Despite the efforts of delegates at this month’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;climate summit in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, the world is still &lt;a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/"&gt;careening toward&lt;/a&gt; potentially catastrophic levels of global warming. Now, some countries and corporations are turning to new technologies to pull carbon out of the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UynXW"&gt;Today, the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced a bold new &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-launches-carbon-negative-earthshots-remove-gigatons-carbon-pollution"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; to make those technologies, called carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, cost-effective and scalable with the launch of a new “Carbon Negative Shot” initiative. Through this initiative, the agency seeks to bring the cost of CDR down dramatically this decade — to less than $100 a ton — so that it can be deployed at a big enough scale to remove “gigatons,” or billions of tons, of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nkLze9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That is a hell of a lot of CO2 pollution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ER2qzI"&gt;That is a hell of a lot of CO2 pollution. Sequestering one gigaton of carbon dioxide would amount to removing the pollution of about 250 million vehicles — the US’s entire light-duty fleet — in one year, according to the DOE. With CDR technologies still in pretty early stages of development, there are significant hurdles to overcome before the DOE can do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4Hoyc"&gt;CDR is a suite of strategies aimed at drawing down CO2 to keep it from trapping heat in the atmosphere. Nature can do some of that for us — trees and plants pull CO2 out of the air. There’s also “direct air capture” technology that mimics that process using carbon-sucking machines, but it has yet to be deployed at a large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Nub7c"&gt;To draw down enough&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;heat-trapping pollution, the US will likely need large-scale direct air capture plants. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;largest direct air capture plant&lt;/a&gt; came online in Iceland earlier this year, and it’s only able to pull out 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. That’s roughly equivalent to the emissions from 790 passenger vehicles in a year. To date, there are only 19 direct air capture plants around the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and they only have the capacity to capture a tiny fraction of what the DOE’s aims are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDBR69"&gt;Cost is one big reason why the tech hasn’t advanced further. Companies like Microsoft pay about $600 for each ton of CO2 the Iceland plant captures. The company pumped out the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;11,164,000 metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of carbon dioxide in its 2020 fiscal year. At $600 a ton, Microsoft would need to pay almost $6.7 billion to remove just one year of its pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SgdgXt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cost is one big reason why the tech hasn’t advanced further&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OC97CX"&gt;But cost isn’t the only challenge. Direct air capture plants trap CO2 &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture"&gt;using filters or chemical solutions&lt;/a&gt;. To release the trapped CO2 so that it can be safely stored, the filter or chemical solution needs to be heated up to very high temperatures — between 100 and 900 degrees Celsius. That takes a lot of energy. In a catch-22, the machines that pull carbon out of the air could wind up using as much as a quarter of the global energy supply by 2100, according to a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/direct-co2-capture-machines-could-use-quarter-global-energy-in-2100"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. If that energy comes from burning fossil fuels, it could contribute to the problem it’s trying to solve. (And it’s still technically difficult to use purely renewable energy to reach the extremely high temperatures required for the chemical solution method of direct air capture.)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That’s likely why the DOE says in its announcement today that it wants to ensure that “emissions created when running and building the removal technology are accounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTwkeY"&gt;Lastly, the DOE is aiming to secure places to store CO2 where it can be monitored for at least 100 years. It ideally needs to stay sequestered for much longer to keep humanity from falling deeper into climate crisis. At the Iceland plant, CO2 is pumped underground, where the companies behind the project say it can be stored in rock formations for thousands of years. Volcanically active Iceland has relatively young and porous basalt rock that’s ideal for this kind of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B7ZnNS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Billions of dollars for new pipelines and carbon storage infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rugyA6"&gt;The US will not only need to find similarly well-suited locations — it’ll need to transport it there via new pipelines. The Biden administration’s infrastructure bill that’s inching closer to a final vote includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;billions of dollars for new pipelines&lt;/a&gt;, and $3.5 billion for four direct air capture “hubs.” That already has some environmental groups concerned about pipeline ruptures, like one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642806/co2-pipeline-explosion-satartia-mississippi-carbon-capture"&gt;sickened residents of a small, majority-Black community&lt;/a&gt; in Mississippi last year. At high concentrations, carbon dioxide is a dangerous asphyxiant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zBBif"&gt;Despite all those challenges, leading climate scientists working with the United Nations have included carbon removal in &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;roadmaps&lt;/a&gt; for limiting the climate crisis to somewhat manageable levels. That’s gotten &lt;a href="https://www.ienearth.org/hands-off-mother-earth/"&gt;criticism from some progressive activists&lt;/a&gt; who see carbon removal as a distraction from transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. And even experts optimistic about the future of the technology caution that it’s meant to be a side dish and not the main course in any plan to combat climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDpjZW"&gt;“It is at most a supplement that can help us reduce climate change,” David Morrow, director of research at the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University, told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in September&lt;/a&gt; when the Iceland plant came online. “But it can’t take the place of cutting emissions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09oN5G"&gt;The US, the world’s second-biggest CO2 polluter, still needs to focus primarily on finding alternatives to fossil fuels so that it can prevent greenhouse gas emissions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
