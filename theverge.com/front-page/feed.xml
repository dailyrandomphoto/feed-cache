    <title>Amazon Smart Thermostat review: a $60 stunner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The budget thermostat Nest should have made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pKc8wM"&gt;Since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched in 2011, no other smart thermostat has emulated its core function — learning your schedule and adapting to it automatically, so you don’t have to lift a finger. This feature has made the Nest one of the best smart thermostats (lots of) money can buy for years. But just a decade on, Amazon has finally done it. The online shopping giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 Amazon Smart Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; can intelligently determine if you’re home, away, or sleeping and automatically adjust your climate to keep you comfortable and potentially save you money. And you don’t have to program anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px6wKx"&gt;Amazon worked with Resideo (owner of the historic thermostat brand Honeywell Home) to develop the thermostat, and its internals are very similar to the Honeywell T9 and T5 smart thermostats. It’s compatible with most 24 volt HVAC systems (you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=smart+thermostat&amp;amp;qid=1637326592&amp;amp;s=hi&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check compatibility here&lt;/a&gt;), but doesn’t support systems with more than three stages or multi-speed fans. Together, Amazon and Resideo seem to have finally cracked the smart thermostat conundrum, and the Amazon Smart Thermostat’s learning feature — called Hunches — is very good. No, it isn’t quite as good as Nest’s, but it also doesn’t cost $250. So, tradeoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nue7FD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10875005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtN1I8"&gt;Hunches — which are part of Amazon’s broader Alexa smart home platform — are AI-driven decisions that use data from your Alexa smart home to decide what to do with your temperature. It follows, unsurprisingly, that the more Echo smart speakers and displays you have in your home, the better it will be. According to Amazon, Hunches also uses “select other smart home devices like lights, locks, and sensors” to determine if you are home or away, as well as geolocation of yours and your household members’ smartphones (everyone has to have the Alexa app installed and location settings turned on for the thermostat). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0YTyB"&gt;However, unlike with the similar Nest experience, you don’t have control over which devices make those decisions; you don’t even know which ones make the decisions. This led to some confusion in my testing, including that Alexa now thinks I get up at 4:31AM every morning, I assume because my daughter sat up in bed at that time and has an Echo Show as her bedside clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSQjnr"&gt;For the next three days, it turned on the heat a little too early, and I had to go into the thermostat settings in the app to tell Alexa its Hunch was wrong. After three times telling it that, no, we do not wake up at 4:31AM, it reverted to our regular wake-up time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sjS4Nicw4w-eSg0vp726Jxi29U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019741/jtuohy_211116_4885_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The controls on the Smart Thermostat are three touch points on the bottom. LED icons show you the ambient temperature by default, then the current set point when you tap on one of the arrows.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Foqcf2"&gt;It’s hard to quibble much at this price, however, because at least it’s trying to be smart. Outside of Nest and Ecobee, few thermostats are actually smart. Most are just controlled remotely — either by an app, voice, or geolocation (where it adjusts based on whether your smartphone is at home). This is all very handy, but it’s not intelligent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3oHVU"&gt;Case in point, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; has no advanced AI features of which to speak. While it can do useful energy-saving or comfort-increasing tasks such as preheat or cool the home or use the fan to circulate air to more efficiently use air conditioning, it doesn’t have any learning features and its smarts are reliant on Google’s geofenced home / away modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNGDdE"&gt;If you don’t like the idea of Amazon controlling your climate willy-nilly, the Smart Thermostat has a standard scheduling option. With either set up, you can also use Alexa’s Routines to have your thermostat do specific things based on time of day, when a smart home device tells it to (such as a compatible temperature or motion sensor), or with your voice. These functions are available to any smart thermostat that works with Alexa, but you will not find one as inexpensive as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlv1hKJQNQukGCEHtt0PV4lZhfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019731/jtuohy_211115_4885_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Smart Thermostat is a simple white box that snaps on to a base, which you wire into your existing thermostat wiring. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SijpUPNp6MoMfHuKB0q4MtdXKQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019733/jtuohy_211115_4885_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It comes with a faceplate to help cover up any holes in the wall from removing your existing thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Thnrgy"&gt;The closest competitor price-wise — the Wyze Smart Thermostat — is $80, and the Honeywell T5 and T9, whose hardware the Amazon thermostat shares, start at $120. Most other smart thermostats are over $100, including the Emerson Sensi, the Lux Kono, and then Ecobee’s and Nest’s start at $180 and $130, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyte3e"&gt;Of course, almost all those thermostats work with multiple platforms. The Amazon thermostat only works with Alexa. And while the coming smart home standard Matter — which promises interoperability between ecosystems — may change that, Amazon has not confirmed that this device will be upgraded to support Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdjFQN"&gt;While this thermostat is inexpensive, it doesn’t look cheap, unlike the Wyze Smart Thermostat, which has a plasticky feel and an odd, oblong design. The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes, and because it doesn’t have an LCD screen, it doesn’t scream “high tech” like others in this space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqU6Qi"&gt;Instead, the all-white plastic body has a capacitive touch surface that illuminates LEDs to show you the touch points, system mode, and set temperature. There is also a small green tree that appears when you set the temperature to ones Amazon thinks are energy-saving — 68 degrees or below for heating and 75 degrees or above for cooling in my location. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; I have to wonder how Nest and its iconic green leaf feels about this. At least Amazon didn’t copy Nest and make you pay an extra $15 for a faceplate to cover up any wall warts left after installation; you get one included (and a screwdriver!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3fzd1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8FXYN"&gt;Despite the minimalist look, there are enough controls on the device for easy, everyday use — you can switch modes from heat, cool, fan, and auto, as well as adjust the temperature up and down and turn the system off. Only the bottom of the device is touch-capacitive, and there are three small markers to show where to touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UZsYt"&gt;Most of the setup and programming of the thermostat requires the Alexa app. And, as you’d expect from an Amazon device, it’s designed to be controlled with your voice. This makes it surprising that the Alexa voice assistant isn’t built in as it is in some of Ecobee’s models. Instead, you need to have a compatible Alexa device for voice control. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_LtOPvE80jG3jALjBcjIwElY4QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019735/jtuohy_211115_4885_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical installation of the Smart Thermostat is identical to that of Honeywell’s T9 or T5 and requires shutting off the power and wiring the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a7ZgMx"&gt;Integration with Alexa is straightforward and doesn't require a skill or account linking. Setup and installation of the thermostat is similarly simple. You will want to check if your heating and / or cooling system is compatible first, however. And if you don’t have a C-wire, you will need to opt for the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F5M7ZJT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 version&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a C-wire adapter and plan for a much more involved installation. (C-wire is short for common wire and supplies power to your thermostat. Most connected thermostats need a C-wire to connect to Wi-Fi, which is a big power drain.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6RpV8lPgtXL48kpW7TuL71apy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027512/1C240497_D38F_4D22_8F07_0B21AC3D1CD5.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alexa app offers a good interface for controlling the thermostat, it just takes a bit of digging to find it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pE2PA"&gt;Everything you need to install the thermostat comes in the box, including a screwdriver and handy labels for identifying the thermostat wires. The Alexa app guided me through installation very well, making it clear which wires should go where, connecting the thermostat to my Wi-Fi, and testing that everything was working correctly. If you are uncomfortable with wiring or aren’t familiar with how your heating and cooling system works, you should get professional help. Messing up your HVAC system will be a costly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Dxb8"&gt;Using the Alexa Smart Thermostat was a smooth experience. The Hunches worked well (other than my 4:30AM blip), turning my heating down between 11PM and 11:30PM every night and back on at 6AM in the morning. Switching to away when the house was empty during the day was less reliable, and in my week of testing, I wasn’t able to get a firm read on how long it takes to adjust to an empty home — this is a key component of any energy savings this device will get you, so I’ll update this review once I’ve had more time to evaluate the feature. However, you do have the option of telling Alexa, by saying “Alexa, I’m leaving” as you walk out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYZXdZ"&gt;Controlling the thermostat with voice using an Echo speaker or display was smooth — and with the latter, an interactive screen pops up for further control if needed. You can control the mode with voice, too, switching to heating or cooling, and even ask Alexa to change the temperature when no one is home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="rvCPbP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875137"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3BRL4z"&gt;But the app was a more frustrating experience. It takes four or five taps to get into the thermostat screen, although eventually I was able to add the thermostat to the new Favorites section in Alexa’s devices page, which speeds things up a tad. Once on the correct screen, the controls mimic those of the physical device, plus there’s a humidity reading (the thermostat has a humidity sensor in it, a temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor for adjusting the brightness of the LEDs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUMrsx"&gt;The one other area I ran into issues with was using the thermostat in a two-zoned home. As with all thermostats, you need one for each zone in a multi-zoned system&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and they control the climate independently.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Alexa app wouldn’t let me set the home, away, and sleep temperatures separately; whatever I set for my upstairs zone also applied to my downstairs zone. That’s not ideal if you like to sleep at 66 degrees but want your living room and kitchen to drop to 62 at night to save energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4crZWU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multi-zone support needs some work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzlNni"&gt;Switching the upstairs thermostat to a schedule and keeping the downstairs on Hunches did allow me to have different set points, but that’s not an ideal solution. This is a problem in the Alexa software, as with every other thermostat I have tested in this two-zone system, each thermostat controls each zone entirely independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w93VPY"&gt;The other drawback is that there are no temperature sensors designed specifically for the Alexa Smart Thermostat. It’s possible to set Alexa Routines to use with the temperature sensors built into some Echo speakers or with compatible third-party motion or temperature sensors like those from Centralite and Aqara, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761003/amazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines"&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Air Quality Monitor will work with Routines&lt;/a&gt;. But that integration isn’t as seamless or as easy to use as thermostats with native temperature sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nfsg2D968iwUDAINfSfwodY0a-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019737/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While there are basic controls on the device, the Alexa app on a compatible smartphone is required to set up and control the thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EpowwF"&gt;The Nest Learning Thermostat, the Ecobee thermostats, and the Honeywell T9 Thermostat all work very well with their own external sensors, but these thermostats cost $100 to $150 more than Amazon’s. You also don’t get useful extra features such as the time and weather displayed on this cheaper thermostat or integration with platforms or voice assistants other than Alexa. Still, if those features aren’t important to you, then you really can’t go wrong with this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ohct2i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to not be impressed with this thermostat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aVJNM3"&gt;Based on my testing, it’s hard not to be impressed with the Amazon Smart Thermostat, and not just because it’s cheap. I have tested almost every smart thermostat released since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched a decade ago, and this is easily one of the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Lh8bxj"&gt;I would still choose a Nest Learning Thermostat for my home because I love the look and feel of it, and I have more control over how it manages my home’s climate (plus it works with both Google and Alexa). However, I thoroughly recommend the Amazon Smart Thermostat over the new Google Nest Thermostat, which is a dumbed-down version of the original (something of a theme with Nest devices these days). Honestly, the Amazon Smart Thermostat is the budget thermostat Google Nest should have made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A hedge fund billionaire outbid crypto investors for a rare copy of the US Constitution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The 2016 SALT Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZoFYUcEX4FkPaTRf1ju3Jwr_bY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70167731/530884400.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SPRi4"&gt;It turns out the way to beat the collective will of the internet’s cryptocurrency fans is to have way, way more money than them. Ken Griffin, the CEO and founder of Citadel, has revealed himself as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;the winner of last night’s $43.2 million auction&lt;/a&gt; for a rare copy of the US Constitution. A collective of crypto enthusiasts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787993/constitutiondao-crypto-buy-us-constitution-copy-sothebys-ethereum"&gt;calling themselves ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, managed to raise $47 million in about a week’s time in a quixotic attempt to win the document themselves and put it on display to the public for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DajNmR"&gt;While the DAO didn’t win, they did manage to push the price up on Griffin, with the two parties slowly going back and forth million by million during the auction last night, each seemingly uncertain if they would be able to go a million higher with every passing bid. Finally, ConstitutionDAO threw in the towel, telling supporters they wouldn’t have had enough remaining money to “insure, store, and transport the document.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SUkRS9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuqpNW"&gt;Griffin seems to be aware that a collective of 17,000 people will be pretty unhappy with him, so, perhaps not-so-coincidentally, he’s committing to roughly the same goals that they laid out for the document had they won the auction. “I intend to ensure that this copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view and appreciate in our museums and other public spaces,” he said in a statement. That’ll start with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, which has free admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttJu7v"&gt;Citadel is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2021/10/05/richest-hedge-fund-managers-forbes-400-list-2021/?sh=21da81e0eea4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; ranks him&lt;/a&gt; fourth on their list of wealthiest hedge fund managers, with a net worth of $16.1 billion. His win at the auction may only further frustrate the internet-first finance crowd, some of whom are skeptical of Citadel Securities (a subsidiary of Citadel) because it pays Robinhood to see what investors are up to. Just this week, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/robinhood-citadel-win-gamestop-lawsuit"&gt;dismissed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Robinhood and Citadel Securities colluded to freeze trading during the GameStonk explosion in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BNnQO"&gt;After losing the bid, ConstitutionDAO is essentially dissolving and plans to return all funds raised to contributors, minus transaction fees. The group’s organizers say “this wasn’t the outcome we hoped for,” but they were “still in shock that we even got this far.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next-gen hardware, last-gen games: where the PS5 and Xbox Series X have fallen short</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsutCsKz_xLQ7Lm6CMcNQryQlXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70167635/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vgwgAn"&gt;A year ago, the next generation of console gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430284/microsoft-sony-xbox-series-ps5-nvidia-rtx-3080-next-gen-gaming"&gt;was supposed to have arrived&lt;/a&gt;. The Xbox Series X (and Series S) and PlayStation 5 strode boldly onto the scene, with massive chassis and even bigger promises of games with better graphics, shorter loading times, and revolutionary new breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUu7MJ"&gt;But a year in, and that next generation of gaming has yet to arrive. There are still too few consoles, and more importantly, too few games that truly take advantage of them, leaving the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X more of a beta test for the lucky few who have been able to get ahold of one, rather than the proper start of a new era of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3O616f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vwAMMJ"&gt;A complicated mess of factors have led to the next-gen bottleneck. The physical consoles themselves are still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;nigh-impossible to buy&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;naturally limits&lt;/a&gt; the number of customers who own them and can buy games for them. That in turn means that there’s little incentive for developers to aim for exclusive next-gen titles that truly harness the power of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. Why limit yourself (and your sales) to the handful of next-gen console owners when there are millions of Xbox One and PS4 customers to whom you can sell copies of games? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be1Y0u"&gt;Adding to the mess has been the fact that industry-wide delays (many of which are due to similar pandemic-related issues as the broader supply chain problems) have also seen tons of next-gen optimized or exclusive games moved out to 2022 and beyond. Meaning even if you can get ahold of a console, there are still relatively few blockbuster titles to actually play on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ip24V5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even if you can get ahold of a console, there are still too few next-gen games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6GpEna"&gt;With the exception of a handful of true next-gen exclusives, like &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, virtually every big “next-gen” release has been available on older consoles and PC. &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; was on Xbox One and PS4, as was &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3eEBJ"&gt;And that’s a trend that’s set to continue for the foreseeable future: &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; are playable on an original Xbox One from 2013 right alongside the cutting-edge Xbox Series X; a first-generation PlayStation 4 from almost a decade ago will get the same &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;God of War Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; games as an impossible-to-find PS5. Microsoft has already pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/10/21060019/xbox-series-x-exclusive-games-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-pc"&gt;aim for concurrent Xbox releases&lt;/a&gt; on its first-party games. And most Sony first-party games have been a successive series of reading the fine print after each announcement, only to discover that they weren’t PS5-exclusive titles that would actually take advantage of the processing power and SSD speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Asz-a230T-bzB37s2a7FcXq4X4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660013/ratchet_and_clank_rift_apart_screenshot_01_ps5_en_15jun20.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1AZrMp"&gt;It’s no wonder that on Sony’s list of the most-played PS5 games from the console’s first year, just a single title — &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;— is a true PS5 exclusive. And that’s a remake of a PS3 game from 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzgFB1"&gt;To be clear, there are always transition periods. A year into the Xbox 360’s and PS4’s lifes pan, and there were still plenty of major cross-platform titles. Huge titles like &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age: Inquisition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; all tried to cross the generational divide. Not all those ports were effective — &lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&lt;/em&gt;, for example, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-of-mordor-is-way-less-fun-on-old-consoles-1660387779"&gt;had an infamously watered down version&lt;/a&gt; of the Xbox One / PS4 game, a hint that developers were already starting to hit the wall of what the older consoles could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTHjbl"&gt;But there were also already big, next-gen-only games that were taking advantage of the extra power of the new hardware, games like &lt;em&gt;inFamous: Second Son&lt;/em&gt; and its neon-particle-fueled powers, or &lt;em&gt;Sunset Overdrive&lt;/em&gt;’s hordes of soda zombies. And even some big third-party titles were starting to embrace the newer consoles, like the Xbox One and PS4-only &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Unity&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMUh0T"&gt;It’s not necessarily a bad thing that new games are available to a broader audience, either. But much like we saw in the last generational transition, when a game in 2021 has to be built to take into account the finest hardware that 2013 had to offer, those games are going to be held back in tangible ways. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;dev team has already been frank about how memory streaming limits impacted how freely the game’s mechanical prehistoric creatures could roam or interact with each other. It’s the kind of feature that the PS5’s ultra-fast hardware should theoretically solve. But with &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; now set to launch on both Sony’s current-gen and next-gen consoles, it’s not clear that the sequel will be able to offer that kind of functionality, either. (Game director Mathijs de Jonge claims that they “didn’t really think about hardware limitations” in an interview with &lt;a href="https://singaporenewslive.com/interview-horizon-forbidden-wests-creators-promise-a-highly-ambitious-sequel/225124/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Singapore News Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjOTE4FhYNQ7I45pG22GBQPvLtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024250/Qi6iPb5.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Sw8aYe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cross-generational games are going to be held back in tangible ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZE70Zs"&gt;The same might be true of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22789079/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;semi-open world&lt;/a&gt;: how much of the virtual walls that divide up Zeta Halo into discrete playing areas in the upcoming game are design choices, and how many are due to the eight-year-old hardware that Microsoft is trying to support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWiHQB"&gt;Even the consoles themselves have taken some time to work through growing pains: both Sony and Microsoft have had to make multiple updates to smooth out the rough edges of their software, and basic features, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738994/xbox-series-x-s-dashboard-native-4k-brightness-night-mode-quick-settings-update"&gt;Xbox Series X’s 4K dashboard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;the PS5’s option to add additional storage&lt;/a&gt;, are only just now becoming available. If you’re just picking up an Xbox Series X or PS5 a year in, you managed to miss out on a lot of software awkwardness of the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDcs6I"&gt;The delays actually work in Sony’s and Microsoft’s favor in some ways here: these kinds of early issues are common for new consoles, and the supply issues mean that there’s more time to sort a lot of them out &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the majority of gamers get ahold of them. And even if the next-gen experiences aren’t quite here yet, there are still good reasons to pick one up, whether it’s just futureproofing or the fact that they do offer some nice perks in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;making old games look and play better&lt;/a&gt;. Load times &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; faster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;in games that have been optimized&lt;/a&gt; for the PS5 and Xbox SSDs, and games do look nicer, with bonus ray-tracing perks, more consistent 4K gameplay, and faster frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="R02SbQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875635"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAte1o"&gt;It’s all but guaranteed that the PS5 and XSX will eventually get to the point where there are real, compelling reasons to pick one up over a current-gen console beyond faster frame rates or ray tracing on the same games. But where things stand now, the two consoles are just extremely pricey performance mode unlocks for games that you can already play on a console you already own; the experiences they offer now are still closer to a souped-up PS4 Pro or Xbox One X than the true leaps of which they’re capable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0jGAM"&gt;It’s certainly frustrating that over a year in, it’s nigh-impossible to just walk into a store and buy a PS5 or Xbox. And if you don’t have a PlayStation or Xbox already, it’s an especially problematic limbo, given the fact that buying any flavor of Xbox One or PlayStation 4 at the nadir of its time in the spotlight feels foolish. But for the millions of folks who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; own a previous-gen console, you’re still not missing out on much yet while you’re stuck endlessly waiting for a PS5 or XSX to appear. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford drops plan for Rivian-powered EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJeVaQdvEwWL-PX6MohmkLDdQ4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70167504/mclark_210923_4776_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSCBc2"&gt;Ford no longer plans to make an electric vehicle with EV startup Rivian, CEO Jim Farley tells &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-rivian-cancel-plans-jointly-develop-ev"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Detroit automaker originally announced it wanted to make a Rivian-powered EV in 2019 when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech"&gt;made its first investment of $500 million into the startup&lt;/a&gt;. Ford and Rivian already canceled a vehicle they planned to make for the Lincoln luxury brand in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kyLYT"&gt;One reason Farley gave for canceling the EV collaboration was the complexity of combining Rivian’s electric architecture with Ford’s own software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FtnUT"&gt;“When you compare today with when we originally made that investment, so much has changed: about our ability, about the brand’s direction in both cases, and now it’s more certain to us what we have to do,” Farley said. “We want to invest in Rivian — we love their future as a company — but at this point, we’re going to develop our own vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XO6YgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“so much has changed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J86lfP"&gt;The decision to cancel the EV was mutual, according to Rivian. “As Ford has scaled its own EV strategy and demand for Rivian vehicles has grown, we’ve mutually decided to focus on our own projects and deliveries,” Miranda Jimenez, a spokesperson for Rivian, said in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our relationship with Ford is an important part of our journey, and Ford remains an investor and ally on our shared path to an electrified future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQ9gRs"&gt;Ford made its initial investment in Rivian seven months before it revealed the Mustang Mach-E, and just over two years before it revealed the F-150 Lightning. But it has found remarkable early success with those EVs. It has already made more than the 50,000 it planned to build in 2021, the first full year of Mustang Mach-E production, and is nearing &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/ford-aims-double-ev-production-capacity-two-years-ceo-jim-farley-says"&gt;200,000 deposits for the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BL8Hk"&gt;Farley also told &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt; this week that Ford plans to double the number of EVs it will build globally by the end of 2023 to 600,000. In September, Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696427/ford-ev-battery-factory-tennessee-kentucky-investment"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to build two new battery factories in Kentucky and a “mega campus” in Tennessee that will build batteries and electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZmgdj"&gt;Rivian, meanwhile, certainly has its hands full. It just started shipping its R1T electric pickup trucks, is aiming to ship its R1S electric SUVs by the end of the year, and is also working on electric delivery vans for Amazon — which is also heavily invested in the startup. The startup recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;went public in one of the biggest IPOs ever&lt;/a&gt;, raising some $12 billion in the process. As a result, Ford’s 12 percent stake in Rivian is now worth more than $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOkauQ"&gt;Ford helped Rivian get to that point, as was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; in the startup’s stock exchange filings. Ford built the body-in-whites for Rivian’s prototypes — the skeletal frame that rides on the chassis — and agreed to supply “certain vehicle components... including related engineering work and tooling” for the entire lineup of R1 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFLNSZ"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Self Service Repair program is an opportunity to repair relationships</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r5nDrl"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions"&gt;newly announced&lt;/a&gt; Self Service Repair program, set to launch in early 2022, will finally provide individual customers access to genuine Apple OEM parts and manuals for DIY iPhone (and eventually Mac) repairs. Although this program has limitations, and there are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many lingering questions&lt;/a&gt; about how it will be implemented, it is an opportunity for Apple to improve relationships with its customers by making repairs easier. If Apple prices the parts right, the program could also be a way for motivated customers to save money on repairs by going DIY while allowing independent repair shops to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47lmru"&gt;Until now, access to factory OEM parts for iPhones and Macs has been restricted to several Apple-blessed places, including Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASP), Apple Stores, and Apple Independent Repair Providers (IRP), a program that allows independent shops to gain access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training guides for common out-of-warranty Mac and iPhone repairs. Apple’s new self-service program — just like the IRP program — is focused only on screen, battery, and camera repairs when it comes to iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVd3Jc"&gt;Apple plans to become the main resource for individuals looking for access to parts and manuals — &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; “more than 200 individual parts and tools” for iPhone 12 and 13 models early next year. While that number sounds high given that the self-service program will launch with parts for just two models of iPhones, Kevin Purdy, a writer for online repair guide site iFixit, found it believable. Apple, he says, could sell various adhesives, specialty tools, individual screws, custom presses, electrostatic discharge mats, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Illustration of girl at a workbench with various tools preparing to work on a replacement screen for an iPhone 12 or 13 pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1LxDtb991b4UeOa2L-dDyebr2h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23026632/Apple_Self_Service_Repair_self_service_11172021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This illustration from an Apple press release depicts at least 10 parts and tools for a single repair coming out of one shipping box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xdhzC2"&gt;These parts are already available to Apple service providers, and the prices are pretty high because the devices are so new. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;Apple itself&lt;/a&gt; charges customers $279 to repair the screen of an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13 Pro. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F55370%2Fapple-diy-repair-program-parts-tools-guides-software&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22787245%2Fapple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to iFixit&lt;/a&gt;, members of Apple’s IRP program pay about $270 to stock up on these screens (nearly the same as what Apple charges for the repair). However, the out-of-pocket cost for IRP members is reduced to $235 if the old part is sent back, according to iFixit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H28ygS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This removes a big barrier for Apple in the path to legislation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LU6wXd"&gt;While Apple says that individuals using the Self Service Repair program will receive a credit back for the old part, it’s not clear how much money you can save by taking this path, and Apple didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on the matter. In my experience as a former employee of Apple, I recall that it was also Apple Store policy to not allow customers to take back old parts from the repairs we did for them (including bad hard drives from Macs). Based on how important bad part returns seem to Apple, whatever credit Apple will offer to customers using the self-service program could be significant enough to motivate old part returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNAiXp"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/11/21/2578547/former-apple-retail-ron-johnson-interview"&gt;Ron Johnson era&lt;/a&gt; of Apple retail, I worked as a Genius repairing many Macs and early-model iPhones in an Apple retail store. While many of the repairs were expensive on paper, our employee training specifically taught us to provide some repairs for free to promote customer satisfaction, as long as devices didn’t show signs of abuse. Those policies tightened noticeably after Johnson’s departure in 2011, with John Browett taking over as SVP of Apple retail and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/no-surprise-browetts-reign-over-apple-retail-a-short-7-months/"&gt;focusing on cutting costs&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, Apple also introduced the AppleCare Plus service plan add-on for iPhones, in which accidental damage is covered after paying a $49 service fee. Despite the changes, other former employees &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/tech/apple-retail-store-trick-free-repair-replacement-tiktok-video/"&gt;have talked about how Apple’s push to “surprise and delight”&lt;/a&gt; customers can still lead to customers getting free in-store repairs. Whether that will change in the era of self-service is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4V0ePk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hope is that this will be enough to empower more DIY&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLm56z"&gt;Normally, you could save money by buying aftermarket parts, but right now, aftermarket OLED screens for an iPhone 12 range from $279.99 (iFixit) for just the part to $329.99 (Amazon) for a full kit, which is a heavy cost. Going aftermarket also adds the risk that quality might not be as good as factory OEM pieces, and some parts could lose functionality, such as Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11256118/apple-new-ipad-price-specs-release-date"&gt;True Tone adaptive screen feature&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, customers could save money via Self Service Repair if Apple priced the parts comparable to what IRPs currently pay. However, then IRPs would lose out on business unless Apple offered them a further discount on parts compared with the self-service program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptnIVc"&gt;Another potential way individuals might use the self-service program is to stock up on parts like independent shops in the IRP program can do. Apple might choose to differentiate the IRP program and the Self Service Repair program by not allowing individuals to stock up, however, making it harder for DIY folks trying to plan ahead for devices they’ll want to repair in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KJXvsb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfjWDQOMQdU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RSETV"&gt;In general, it’s going to be people with older phones who are more likely to need a repair, and right now, Apple’s Self Service Repair program won’t help them. iFixit CEO&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kyle Wiens notes that replacement batteries aren’t necessary for most customers until about a year and a half after the phone was purchased, when battery cells start depleting. While Wiens is overall excited about Apple’s announcement and direction, he believes that the self-service program is primarily Apple’s strategy for getting out in front of potential &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;regulatory action from FTC &lt;/a&gt;and even pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787336/apple-right-to-repair-self-service-diy-reason-microsoft"&gt;its own shareholders over the right to repair&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has also been under scrutiny &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348240/apple-right-to-repair-legislation-antitrust-investigation-policy"&gt;from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; over its restrictive repair practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pjIGB"&gt;Despite its limitations, there is hope that Apple’s new program will empower more DIY repair folks and perhaps give an opportunity to save some cash. And if a customer gets cold feet when the kit arrives, they might have another option: taking it to a local repair shop that doesn’t have access to genuine Apple parts. That shop could then charge a small fee and do the repair for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rockstar promises fixes for GTA remaster mess, will relist original titles on PC</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFYEPEaq8ErKjhYPVNcVpy-t2iI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166644/GTAVC_PC_Retail_6.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — Definitive Edition&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aIMmFU"&gt;Rockstar has published a blog post apologizing for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783286/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-pc-hot-coffee-rockstar-games-launcher"&gt;rocky launch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;, which packages together remastered versions &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;GTA: Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;GTA: San Andreas. &lt;/em&gt;The company is promising a “Title Update” in the coming days that will “address a number of issues” and plans to make the original PC versions of the three games available as a bundle “shortly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xHL3d"&gt;“Firstly, we want to sincerely apologize to everyone who has encountered issues playing these games,” the company wrote &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/393o373751k48k/a-note-from-the-rockstar-games-team-re-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-th?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gta-trilogy_announcement_update-20211119"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt; attributed only to Rockstar Games. “The &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; series — and the games that make up this iconic trilogy — are as special to us as we know they are to fans around the world. The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mjr9zh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EIxF1p"&gt;In addition to the planned Title Update, Rockstar says it has “ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward.” It didn’t specify or provide a timeline for when those updates might arrive. As for the rereleases of the classic versions of the games, PC players who already own or buy the &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy &lt;/em&gt;by June 30th, 2022 will receive the bundle for free. Rockstar also didn’t say exactly when this bundle would be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERBtvG"&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;’s November 11th launch, players have observed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783178/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-3-remaster-issues-digital-foundry-video"&gt;numerous bugs and issues&lt;/a&gt;, made many memes about the &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-memes-mock-new-graphics/"&gt;disappointing remastered visuals&lt;/a&gt;, and Rockstar removed the game from sale &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783286/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-pc-hot-coffee-rockstar-games-launcher"&gt;for a few days on PC&lt;/a&gt; to “remove files unintentionally included in these versions.” The whole saga has shades of the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launch fiasco, another highly anticipated title that launched with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia"&gt;a lot of problems&lt;/a&gt; and spawned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;a lot of memes&lt;/a&gt;. While CD Projekt Red has released many updates that have addressed a lot of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; issues, we’ll have to wait to see if Rockstar can follow through with its promises to turn around &lt;em&gt;The Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition is $45 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFuJiL_MAirMoMBlclIHTW3YuSQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166388/cgartenberg_211020_4803_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Kindle Paperwhite Kids edition matches the base model but with extras added in. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ks9gl5"&gt;We are seven days away from the actual Black Friday, but if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"&gt;you have been paying any mind to our ongoing coverage&lt;/a&gt; for this shopping season, you know there are excellent deals happening every dang day. We have all kinds of excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, including some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;retailer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22788031/google-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;brand-specific&lt;/a&gt; roundups, and there’s still a whole lot more to come. For now, let’s take a quick peek at some select deals that just popped up today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMbYqI"&gt;First off, Amazon’s latest version of its acclaimed Kindle Paperwhite — released just last month — is $45 off for the Kids version at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P52R2PL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18gKjIOaL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is a killer deal on the new Paperwhite, complete with its better screen that adjusts color temperature and USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHLWa0"&gt;Since it is the kids version, it has no ads and comes bundled with a protective cover. There is no stipulation that you must buy this for a child, so don’t feel any shame in taking advantage of this yourself. It’s the tech deal equivalent of using your kid to get to the front of a busy line (reminder: &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals &lt;/em&gt;does not condone taking parenting advice from &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the new Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qlJBGZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="TZF3rj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gDrkGg"&gt;If you have too much shame or prefer an even more budget-friendly e-reader, the most affordable Kindle from 2019 is $40 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18gKjIOaL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — just $50 for the ad-supported version or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FPX819Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 without ads&lt;/a&gt;. Kindle prices don’t get any cheaper than this — reaching near-stocking stuffer territory — and though it’s a slightly older model, it still offers that glare-free e-ink screen experience that you only have to remember to charge every few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fMiDIQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dgB1Pk"&gt;Sticking to the Amazon front for a moment, the retail giant is offering discounts on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/14c15d26?ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_6_14c15d26_dt_sl7_e6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;several Echo Show devices&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most notable is the 2021 model Echo Show 5, which is perfect as a bedside display for smart alarms or easy connection to a Ring Doorbell live feed. The compact smart display is normally $85 but is currently discounted to just $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B08J8FFJ8H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18nGDjQxI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGiDWC"&gt;Amazon also has its Kids Edition of the Echo Show 5 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-Kids/dp/B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $50 today&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with a year of Kids Plus subscription for customizing its function to better suit your child’s age. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of both models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rtzq0r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="59Ht7x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jT1A6W"&gt;There are great deals on OnePlus phones across its entry-level, premium, and flagship options. The Nord N200 5G was already a great value proposition, but now you can get it for just $200 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B07XWGWPH5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17RDdFPd3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a whole lot of smartphone chops for two Benjamins. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oKsvh3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10874784"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v0nnCf"&gt;Stepping up to the more premium option, the OnePlus 9 is now just $600 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17Og6sSZa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a discount of $130, bringing the Snapdragon 888-equipped smartphone onto more competitive footing with the Pixel 6. The new Pixels might have bested OnePlus in our latest guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Best Phone to Buy Right Now&lt;/a&gt;, but this sale price makes a OnePlus 9 more worthy of consideration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mjzJAY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10454529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikK3JA"&gt;Finally, this biggest OnePlus sale is reserved for its biggest phone. The ultra-flagship OnePlus 9 Pro is currently $269 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17R8tlJZX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B07XM7WVS8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This undercuts the hard-to-get Pixel 6 Pro by $100, and you get some of the fastest wired charging around. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788960/pixel-6-pro-charging-speeds-30w-21w-23w-slow-charge-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s a bit of a pain point right now for the newest Pixels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="63UPKo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10424103"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sy1QrI"&gt;In the world of tablets and accessories, Brydge makes all kinds of helpful add-ons. Just today, Brydge has extended a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fpages%2Fsales-and-promotions&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791072%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-echo-show-oneplus-9-pro-nord-brydge-ipad-macbook-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20 percent discount on most of its tablet keyboards and MacBook vertical docks&lt;/a&gt;, and many of these deals can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Brydge/page/654BA356-5862-4B3F-9DEA-43E0EC1FDBD0?ref_=ast_bln" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bwHHJj8s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY4B4o"&gt;Some key highlights from the Brydge line include the 10.2 Max Plus and Vertical Dock for the 13-inch MacBook Air. The Brydge 10.2 Max Plus is a keyboard, trackpad, and protective case for base-model iPads. It is currently $30 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18YRAj1c6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Generation-Multi-Touch-MIL-STD-810G-Polycarbonate/dp/B08XWRPVHD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, hitting a new all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XIv6ra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr00GB"&gt;Brydge’s Vertical Docking Station for recent MacBook Air laptops is $40 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Vertical-Compatible-2020-2018-Thunderbolt/dp/B08DG87N7Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf19tWh0zU4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to better optimize the real estate on your desk for $130 instead of the usual $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QkQWgh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10874896"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0tlWJ"&gt;Lastly, have you played &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;yet? No? Well, now it’s just &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal111921&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F303537.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for a brand-new physical copy on PS5, so the excuses are getting few and far between. We didn’t think the hot pick for many critics’ game-of-the-year was going to get cheaper than the recently discounted price of $40, but here we are with a new all-time low that is hard to pass up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pSlLmg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835147"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="dxOk8N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rQwX7G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 19, 2:18PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;An earlier version of this story said that the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition (2021) has wireless charging. It does not. That is a feature of the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (2021). We regret the error.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s campaign co-op isn’t coming until May 2022 at the earliest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ej_gZduFff3GmIdO1b9uN_Wuf-A=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166381/haloinfinitegameplay_sm_acb7e503fbf64354996593a4d969d56e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;em&gt; campaign.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 343 Industries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z4z65p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; co-op campaign and Forge mode, which won’t be in the game when it officially releases on December 8th, are going to launch even later than previously expected. In &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-19-dont-expect-halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-until-may-at-the-earliest"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; head of creative Joseph Staten reiterated that campaign co-op would launch with season 2, but since season 1 was extended by three months to May 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/welcome-to-the-halo-infinite-mp-beta"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, that means the second season is at least half a year away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTeIOE"&gt;Forge is still set to launch with season 3, according to Staten, but we don’t know when that might arrive. And those timelines are still only goals; things may change if other priorities come up, Staten says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJV4pf"&gt;Here’s Staten own words on the matter, from &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZLb1AR"&gt;So our goal still remains what I said before, which is to ship campaign co-op with Season 2 and Forge with Season 3. But those remain goals. Those remain targets. And we can’t commit to any hard dates right now, because as we’re seeing with this multiplayer beta, other things might move up in the priority stack for us. If it turns out that our progression system just isn’t working the way that we intended, if we need to move some of these bigger rocks that I talked about sooner then we as a team will make those decisions and will clearly communicate to our fans why we’re why we’re doing certain things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qu6kMv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s co-op campaign is “playable now,” Staten says, but the development team wants to take the extra time to make sure it’s stable and works well. The current single-player-only campaign, which itself was delayed, already sounds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22789035/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;pretty darn good&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m hoping that the extra time for co-op will be worth the wait — even it means that I can’t run through Zeta Halo with a friend on December 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla accused of ‘rampant sexual harassment’ in new worker lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZQgQtT7CWbAzRt_QuIiwnNFpBYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166335/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla is being sued for sexual harassment | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDbqpD"&gt;A worker at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, is accusing the automaker of creating a hostile work environment where sexual harassment was “rampant.” As first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica Barraza, who was hired as a production associate in 2018, said in a lawsuit filed this week that she was subjected to constant harassment at the factory, including catcalling and inappropriate physical touching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYTehz"&gt;“Nearly every day for three years, my female coworkers and I were objectified, threatened, touched, and propositioned on the factory floor,” Barraza said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I wanted to come to work, do my job, and support my family without having to endure constant sexual harassment. I felt degraded, humiliated and traumatized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KIuHh"&gt;The complaint filed in California Superior Court alleges that supervisors and managers at the Fremont plant not only were aware of a “pervasive culture of sexual harassment” that included sexist language and physical groping but participated in the ongoing abusive behavior. Barraza reported the issues to Tesla’s human resources department, which she says failed to protect her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU64uM"&gt;The Fremont plant is where Tesla makes its Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y electric vehicles. In October, the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710279/tesla-racism-fremont-plant-137-million-judgement-owen-diaz"&gt;ordered to pay $137 million&lt;/a&gt; to a former contractor at the Fremont plant who alleged he was subjected to racial harassment as part of a hostile work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nv0XP1"&gt;According to Barraza’s complaint, while walking to and from her workstation over the course of a workday, she heard comments from men remarking on her “coke bottle” figure and making comments about her body, including “fat ass” and “onion booty.” Male coworkers would “brush up against Ms. Barraza’s back-side (including with their groins) or unnecessarily touch her under the pretext of working together in close quarters,” the complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Edfxzz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tesla’s factory floor more resembles a crude, archaic construction site or frat house than a cutting-edge company in the heart of the progressive San Francisco Bay Area”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2sQSNF"&gt;In September, Barraza began having panic attacks. She is currently on a doctor-ordered medical leave from her job and is being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur5iUB"&gt;“Tesla’s factory floor more resembles a crude, archaic construction site or frat house than a cutting-edge company in the heart of the progressive San Francisco Bay Area,” the lawsuit states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yr0y0e"&gt;Lawsuits against Tesla are relatively rare in part because, as Barraza’s lawsuit notes, the company requires employees to sign arbitration agreements as a condition of employment, meaning the workers waive their right to a jury or court trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng4OGB"&gt;But the Fremont factory has been identified in at least one other lawsuit as a “predator zone” of harassment. In 2017, now-former Tesla engineer AJ Vandermeyden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14764536/tesla-engineer-allege-sexism-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;sued Tesla&lt;/a&gt; for “unwanted and pervasive harassment,” alleging that she and other female employees were denied promotions and paid less than their male colleagues and faced retaliation when they reached out to human resources with their concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15724520/tesla-fires-female-engineer-claims-pervasive-harassment"&gt;Vandermeyden was fired by Tesla&lt;/a&gt; a few months after taking her claims public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rv1XP"&gt;Barraza’s lawsuit describes harassment, both verbal and physical, of other female employees as well. She told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/19/tesla-sexual-harassment/"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; that the culture of harassment came straight from the top, citing a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1453954994546229253?s=20"&gt;tweet by CEO Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; joking about a school he wanted to start, which would have a crude acronym. Musk himself is not named in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7o8bjs"&gt;“That doesn’t set a good example for the factory — it almost gives it like an … ‘he’s tweeting about it, it has to be okay,’ ” Barraza told the&lt;em&gt; Post.&lt;/em&gt; “It’s not fair to myself, to my family, to other women who are working there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOhMsC"&gt;Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday. The company dissolved its press office and rarely responds to media requests. Barraza is seeking compensation, including lost back pay, and an injunction to end harassment at the Fremont plant. Her attorneys also plan to file a claim under the California Private Attorneys General Act on behalf of Barraza and other women who allege they were harassed at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOhKmC"&gt;“Tesla is responsible for the systemic sexual harassment occurring in its factory,” Barraza’s attorney, David A. Lowe, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are bringing this case to put a stop to the harassment against Ms. Barraza and her colleagues.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia is celebrating its second birthday with hardware for free or cheap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EK1McQBseM0To-it2YIAF1nXjTc=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166213/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6UhvW"&gt;On November 19th, 2019, Google launched its Stadia cloud gaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;as a work in progress&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s arguably still one today. But one thing that’s consistently improved is the price of entry, and Google’s bringing it down even further to celebrate Stadia’s second birthday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRftKk"&gt;You should now be able to purchase &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US"&gt;a Stadia Premiere Edition hardware kit&lt;/a&gt; with the Chromecast Ultra and Stadia Controller for just $22.22 or €22.22 in fourteen countries including the US and UK “while supplies last.” In the US, you’ll also be able to get one for free when you purchase any $30 or higher game in the Stadia store until November 29th, though it now appears you’ll get that via a redemption code after your purchase and you may also need to pay shipping (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/11398635"&gt;terms and conditions here&lt;/a&gt;). Google says it’s launching a wide variety of deals on games there today, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mP1nd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has given away a lot of hardware already&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zpoenb"&gt;It’s not unusual for Google to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710308/google-free-stadia-hardware-game-purchase-details"&gt;practically give away Stadia hardware&lt;/a&gt;, mind you, and the Chromecast Ultra isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/31/22603498/google-stadia-controller-chromecast-play-watch-bundle"&gt;the company’s latest and greatest Stadia kit&lt;/a&gt;, but these still feel like the best deals yet. Previous get-free-hardware-with-your-game bundles required you to pay for a full-price $59.99 game. Besides, you can do more with a Chromecast than play games, and even Google’s most basic Chromecast &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA00439-US-Chromecast-3rd-Generation/dp/B015UKRNGS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;still costs $20 on sale&lt;/a&gt;. For $22 or free with a moderately priced game, the Ultra is a pretty good deal, even if it doesn’t come with a TV remote like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;the newest model&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also the only Chromecast with a built-in ethernet port (in its power adapter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7JOPj"&gt;Google says it now has more than 200 games in the Stadia store and has offered nearly half of them at one point or another in its paid Stadia Pro subscription over the past year. If you started subscribing to Pro in November 2020, and made sure to claim every game on offer, you’d likely have paid a little more than $100 for access to 91 different games. Google estimates it would have cost $2,000 to purchase that same game library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umetVG"&gt;It’s not clear how long or how well Google will continue to support Stadia, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;now that its ambitions have lessened&lt;/a&gt;. Both Microsoft and Nvidia have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;upgraded&lt;/a&gt; the hardware powering their cloud gaming services, but Google hasn’t issued any kind of signal that it might follow suit, and most game publishers don’t seem very committed to the platform. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios"&gt;Google reportedly paid tens of millions of dollars per port&lt;/a&gt; in the early days, not exactly a sustainable strategy.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeIvmz"&gt;The company doesn’t have an updated roadmap for Stadia today, but it does say there’s more to come: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cB5lqt"&gt;What’s next for Stadia? Well, we’re eager to continue working on bringing the best games and new features to our community of players so that we can help build a bright future for cloud gaming. That means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW4Ce6"&gt;Continuing feature experiments with the goal of making it easier for players to get into games and try Stadia for themselves. We’re still learning from input provided by our community and appreciate all the constructive feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVgP8h"&gt;Expanding all categories of games content - not just more games overall, but new types of games that we’ve heard players ask for, including genres like online action games, open world titles, plus free games, trials and demos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPoils"&gt;Bringing Stadia to more devices and making it easier to access, purchase, and play games by yourself or with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XEW75A"&gt;Google’s most recent experiment has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747836/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-free-trial-30-minutes"&gt;free timed game trials&lt;/a&gt;. One of Stadia’s current strengths is that it’s extremely easy to try: all you really need is a Google account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7fNQh8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hands-on: Nvidia’s GeForce Now just leapfrogged Google Stadia","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"},{"title":"Google Stadia’s director of games has left for Google Cloud","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665805/google-stadia-jack-buser-games-cloud"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="VNmrf6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9mC1Ct"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 1:53PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Google’s free-with-$30-game-purchase deal is a redeemable code you’ll get after the fact, and may require shipping fee. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z21Huo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;While we did write that the free hardware offer required a $30 game purchase, we also omitted that all-important “$30” part in one sentence. It erroneously read “free when you purchase any game”. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
