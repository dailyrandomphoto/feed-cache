    <title>Amazon’s Echo Show 10 now has Zoom</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QkdlIN"&gt;Amazon’s bringing Zoom compatibility to more devices. The company announced today that it’s making the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10 devices&lt;/a&gt; in the US compatible with the popular video calling software. Users who have their calendars linked up to the Alexa will have their meetings started automatically while people who haven’t done that can say, “Alexa, join my meeting” or “Alexa, join my Zoom meeting” to join one. This is the second Echo Show to gain Zoom access; the Echo Show 8 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;started supporting&lt;/a&gt; the videoconferencing platform in the US in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBbGia"&gt;The Echo Show 10’s camera tracks users as they move throughout a room, meaning callers can see the screen no matter where they sit or stand. Presumably, this functionality will work with Zoom, putting it on par with other competitor devices like the Facebook Portal and Google Nest. Google pulls Zoom meetings from users’ calendars while Facebook allows its Portal camera to track users around the room so that they’re always in frame, just like it does with Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVMnIe"&gt;Although people might start commuting into the office more frequently, Zoom and other videoconferencing software will likely remain a standard for many workplace meetings, especially as workers shift to working from home more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJbhJa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clarence Thomas really wants Congress to regulate Twitter moderation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amy Coney Barrett Is Sworn-In As New Supreme Court Justice At The White House" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bED3BCpCf0CP5MZuPcgOEo0_i3Q=/0x0:4858x3239/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078436/1282403966.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BgtpmI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421840/thomas_biden_knight.pdf"&gt;Responding to a petition on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas laid out a comprehensive constitutional framework for regulating Twitter moderation, signaling that Thomas and other conservatives are eager to take action against social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w3HlM"&gt;Thomas was writing in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15953266/knight-institute-files-trump-twitter-block-lawsuit-first-amendment"&gt;a case brought in 2017 by Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that President Trump was violating the First Amendment by blocking critics on Twitter. A federal appeals court &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20688860/trump-loss-knight-institute-second-circuit-court-twitter-block-lawsuit-analysis"&gt;ruled in favor of the institute&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and Biden’s White House has declined to contest that ruling, making it pointless to continue the case. But since an appeal was filed while Trump was still president, the court is formally required to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PWvS1M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“legislatures might ... be able to treat digital platforms like places of public accommodation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZXApu"&gt;While the dismissal has little legal significance, Justice Thomas used the case as an opportunity to weigh in on more profound issues facing social media platforms. Thomas’ response focuses primarily on Twitter’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;ban Trump from the platform&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the Capitol riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKMsc1"&gt;Nearly every major platform banned then-President Trump in the wake of the Capitol riot — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;including Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — with most citing terms-of-service provisions against using the platform to incite violence. There has been no meaningful legal effort to contest the bans but they remain politically controversial, particularly among American conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlvzFg"&gt;While the ban took place more than six months after the appellate ruling in the Knight case, Thomas uses it as a pretext to examine the separate issue of how Congress or the courts could legally restrain Twitter’s moderation powers to prevent such bans in the future. Over 12 pages, Thomas draws out a detailed case for how lawmakers might restrain platform moderation without violating the First Amendment, drawing on both common carrier designations and English common law rules around the right to exclude customers from public accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Z5OD"&gt;Specifically, Thomas argues that lawmakers could use the scale and public nature of platforms like Twitter to justify new moderation rules, similar to the way the Telecommunications Act prevents phone companies from blocking specific people from phone service. Failing that, lawmakers could craft a statute similar to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ii-civil-rights-act-public-accommodations"&gt;the public accommodations clause of the Civil Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents hotels and restaurants from barring service on the basis of race or creed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SJeSE"&gt;“Even if digital platforms are not close enough to common carriers, legislatures might still be able to treat digital platforms like places of public accommodation,” Thomas continues. “The similarities between some digital platforms and common carriers or places of public accommodation may give legislators strong arguments for similarly regulating digital platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeT7aT"&gt;It’s not the first time Thomas has used a tech-related petition as an opportunity to call for social media regulation. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/clarence-thomas-wants-to-reel-in-section-230-fad81180-1f50-48a6-b638-f9386221f4f2.html"&gt;In October&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas laid out a similar call to pare back the protections offered by Section 230, in a similar motion denying a petition to hear a malware case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1H3UGT"&gt;Notably Thomas’ most recent argument cites &lt;a href="https://yjolt.org/bargaining-free-speech-common-carriage-network-neutrality-and-section-230"&gt;a law review article&lt;/a&gt; by Michigan State professor Adam Candeub, who &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/05/trumps-commerce-department-just-hired-a-lawyer-with-ties-to-white-nationalists/"&gt;served in the Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt; under Trump. Candeub played a role in &lt;a href="https://www.ntia.gov/fcc-filing/2020/ntia-petition-rulemaking-clarify-provisions-section-230-communications-act"&gt;drafting an NTIA petition&lt;/a&gt; to reshape Section 230 through the regulatory process, which would have positioned the FCC as the de facto regulator of social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebooks for every user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 one of the best Chromebooks of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is a good Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is a good Chromebook for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One Medical charged some patients a fee for the COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="One Medical" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cqs2Ai6rSxk--PnsgNVFir8ZzZY=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078140/1175073468.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rFEm0j"&gt;Health care company One Medical charged administration fees to some people receiving COVID-19 vaccines in Washington, DC, according to bills reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company runs the COVID-19 vaccination site at DC’s Entertainment and Sports Arena. People vaccinated at this site were also prompted to sign up for a trial account with One Medical to receive the shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dqUMY"&gt;One Medical told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a statement that an error in the billing system led to the charges, that impacted patients “are being notified,” and that they should disregard the bill. “We are monitoring daily to ensure that no new invoices are going out,” One Medical said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7hXGV"&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=Vaccine%20doses%20purchased%20with%20US,the%20shot%20to%20someone."&gt;not supposed to be a charge&lt;/a&gt; associated with the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vaccine providers can get reimbursed by insurance companies or federal programs for the cost of administering the vaccine, but the CDC’s “Frequently Asked Questions” page says that they cannot charge patients that administration fee directly. The DC Department of Health did not respond to a request for comment by publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzTjUb"&gt;Chris Driver, who lives in Northeast DC, says he was charged by One Medical for both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. He provided his insurance information when he signed in for the first shot but was still billed a total of $56.94 — $16.94 for the first dose, and $40 for the second dose. After receiving the bill for the first dose, Driver tweeted at One Medical on March 18th asking why he was charged. The company responded that it would remove the charge. Over two weeks later, the first charge was still listed on his account, and the second dose fee was added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-75Ffx3Nly0T8_kfEdIwCF3RDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421520/image__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris Driver’s One Medical bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jtexuB"&gt;The charges appear to be inconsistent. Driver’s wife was also vaccinated at the One Medical site, but he says that she did not receive a bill. But another person who got a first dose of the vaccine at the One Medical site was charged $40 by One Medical, according to a bill reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That person — who wished to remain anonymous to discuss personal health information — did not give their insurance information when they got the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6O8aS"&gt;Health officials around the country are working to improve vaccine equity by removing barriers to sign-ups like complex websites or the perception that there’s a charge associated with the shot. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-vaccine-disparities/2021/03/25/f9661460-8126-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;big problem&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC, where more affluent areas have far higher vaccination rates than poorer areas and communities of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxEYUT"&gt;“While I can afford a random $55 medical bill if it came to it, I know that’s not always the case for a whole lot of people in the city,” Driver said in a Twitter direct message. Millions of people say they aren’t going to get vaccinated because they’re worried about costs, according to a &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2021/03/10/covid-vaccine-free-people-not-getting-coronavirus-vaccines-cost-price/"&gt;US Census survey&lt;/a&gt; — even though the vaccines are free. “The federal government is providing the vaccine free of charge to all people living in the United States, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=Vaccine%20doses%20purchased%20with%20US,the%20shot%20to%20someone."&gt;the CDC’s website says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E82knd"&gt;People getting shots in other states have also been stuck with bills. One Houston, Texas-area clinic &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/covid-19-vaccine-administrative-fee-cost-insurance-covid/10420177/"&gt;charged people $30&lt;/a&gt; for each dose of the vaccine, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/covid-19-vaccine-administrative-fee-cost-insurance-covid/10420177/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Investigates&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt;. The Texas Department of State Health Services told &lt;em&gt;13 Investigates&lt;/em&gt; that providers should not be charging people a fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8HJ8Q"&gt;One Medical, which was backed by Alphabet’s venture capital group, GV, provides concierge primary care in over a dozen cities (including Washington, DC) for a $199 annual fee. A handful of states gave the company vaccine doses to administer. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299279/one-medical-covid-vaccine-ineligable-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; in February found that it was giving shots to people who were not eligible in California and Washington state. Those states stopped giving vaccines to One Medical after receiving complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3jC7T"&gt;Tech executive Lucy Caldwell tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;she canceled her One Medical membership after a family member was charged for the COVID-19 vaccine at its site in Washington, DC. In an emailed response to her complaint, a representative told her that bills went to patients “by default” if they did not give insurance information. The representative said that charges are removed if the company is notified and that “dozens” of people had that problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7We3AM76s4UdS71XlXDWVjcXp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421492/EyLGmVsWUAE6ULt.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w3cjws"&gt;People vaccinated at the One Medical site were also asked to sign up for a trial membership of its health service. “That pinged as a red flag for me, because I couldn’t believe the city was asking people to sign up for some health care subscription service in order to get the vaccine,” Driver said. “But, I did it because I wanted to get the dang shot.” The free trial sign-up did not ask for billing information, and it said the service would not auto-renew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3SUA9"&gt;One Medical told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it needed the information in order to create a patient chart for people vaccinated at its site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMqdRG"&gt;Privacy watchdog groups have been worried about private companies using the COVID-19 vaccine administration process to collect personal data on potential customers. Pharmacies like Walgreens require that people create an online account in order to sign up for a vaccine appointment. Consumer rights organizations asked Democratic state attorneys general to investigate how the companies are &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/03/pharmacy-covid-vaccine-customer-data-478977"&gt;using that data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KADrQy"&gt;“We don’t want to see folks in their desire to get vaccinated — and frankly, protect themselves and their loved ones — be in any way taken advantage of,” Andrew Crawford, a lawyer at the Center for Democracy and Technology, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/03/pharmacy-covid-vaccine-customer-data-478977"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOWFLn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fnj8q0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVqC78"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhQ2tg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut on PlayStation has some bugs that need investigating</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLKnA8nQAwd6SL94C6fKjurHEk0=/125x0:1075x633/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69078080/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Studio ZA/UM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6NNOqX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;an upgraded version of one of 2019’s most-acclaimed titles, hit consoles last week with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336035/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-ps5-indie-games"&gt;game’s release on PlayStation 4 and 5&lt;/a&gt;. But fans who have been looking forward to finally trying &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; on console (including myself) have run into many bugs, and developer ZA/UM still hasn’t released a promised update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQxAXs"&gt;Most of the bugs are small but annoying, like finicky controls or voice lines not triggering when they should. (That last one is particularly frustrating given that every line of dialogue is supposed to be voiced, which is &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2021/2/8/22260324/disco-elysium-winter-games-preview-march-2021"&gt;a new change for &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) But players are also reporting a bigger issue: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/mkbyur/fairweather_t500_gauntlets_glitch_ps5/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAiem4HGDWA"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/miqgak/can_anyone_read_this_and_confirm_i_cannot/"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; can’t be completed at all. (Last night, I ran into one of these bugged quests myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POspkj"&gt;On March 31st, a day after the game came out, ZA/UM shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/studioZAUM/status/1377311097271812103"&gt;what’s coming in the 1.2 update&lt;/a&gt;, including smoother controls and fixes for “various” voiceover problems. But the developers still haven’t said exactly when the patch will release, and we don’t know if it will address everything that’s been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KRjyf8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Patch 1.2 incoming for all platforms! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;✔️Fixed locations/interactables not working&lt;br&gt;✔️Fixed items not loading&lt;br&gt;✔️Smoother controller &amp;amp; interaction experience&lt;br&gt;✔️Fixed various VO issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks everyone for playing and reporting, we couldn’t have done it without you ❤️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/6VLlnlojnu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6VLlnlojnu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disco Elysium (@studioZAUM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/studioZAUM/status/1377311097271812103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IMRjJp"&gt;I’m liking &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium: The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt; a lot so far, despite the bugs. But if you’ve been thinking about getting it on PlayStation, I’d recommend waiting until ZA/UM irons out the issues before you pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sALnu6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The US smartphone market just got more boring&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Y5UJKG"&gt;If you’re reading this on a phone, chances are, LG didn’t make it. The Korean tech giant has been losing money and market share with its smartphone division for years, so it wasn’t a surprise when it finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;announced plans to pull the plug&lt;/a&gt; today. You could be forgiven for shrugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmkhG2"&gt;But LG deserves to be remembered as more than just an also-ran. Its phones were rarely big hits, much less often the kind of polished product we’d ever recommend to most over its competitors. Despite this, LG did introduce several features and innovations that the phone world would be worse off without. The company was the first to put ultrawide cameras on its phones, for example, and it pioneered the kind of all-screen, no-button smartphone designs that dominate the market today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2q0XAn"&gt;And particularly in the US, where Android competition is extremely low, the loss of LG will only further entrench the Apple-Samsung duopoly at the high end. LG is the third-biggest phone vendor in the US, with roughly 10 percent of market share, although much of that was midrange prepaid devices sold through carrier stores. LG might not have been at the top of your smartphone shopping list, but if you live in the US, that list just got a lot more boring.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EM9ZNj"&gt;LG did have some claim to being a tastemaker in the pre-smartphone world. Its Chocolate and enV phones were stylish devices that helped LG expand its brand recognition around the world. But after the iPhone and Android changed everything, LG struggled to adapt. I’m duty-bound here to mention the original LG Prada, which had a capacitive touchscreen and was technically announced just before the iPhone, but its true legacy is mostly people pointing that out in online comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYXO5w"&gt;LG’s early Android phones weren’t impressive. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2613319/lg-nitro-hd-review"&gt;2011 Nitro HD&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was its first splashy flagship device in a long time, but it was saddled with outdated, clunky software and poor battery life. Its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3506326/lg-optimus-g-review-att-sprint"&gt;Optimus G&lt;/a&gt;, represented a degree of refinement, and by the time the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4749116/lg-g2-review"&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt; came along in 2012, LG’s new G-series was a fairly credible alternative to the likes of Samsung or HTC. The G2 was one of the first flagship smartphones to attempt to cut down on bezel size, for example, and LG made on-screen buttons a core part of its design long before most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1SuOX"&gt;It was also around this time that LG found a new partner in Google, releasing two Nexus phones in a row. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/2/3589280/google-nexus-4-review"&gt;2012 Nexus 4&lt;/a&gt; was built around the guts of the Optimus G, and it had its fans despite its crippling lack of LTE, weak battery life, and unimpressive camera. The next year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5062724/google-nexus-5-review"&gt;Nexus 5&lt;/a&gt; found an even stronger cult following despite it too having a poor camera and bad battery life. (The red version did look great, and the $349 price didn’t hurt.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The modular LG G5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qnZFVc"&gt;LG’s mobile division kept on ticking on, turning out respectable phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/4/5778556/lg-g3-review"&gt;G3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8559275/lg-g4-review"&gt;G4&lt;/a&gt; without ever really challenging Samsung. The software was still a heavy-handed customization of Android, and LG continued to lag behind peers with its pace of updates, but the hardware was solid. It was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;2016 G5&lt;/a&gt; where things really started to fall apart. Designed around a series of swappable modular accessories called “Friends,” the phone flopped, and LG quickly pretended it never happened. Suffice it to say that if you bought a camera grip or a DAC Hi-Fi audio accessory for your G5, it wouldn’t be able to make Friends with 2017’s G6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8fON0"&gt;It’s unfortunate that LG focused on gimmicks with the G5 because that phone did introduce one new feature that would become ubiquitous in the smartphone market years later: the ultrawide camera. Ultrawides on smartphones let people capture pictures that were previously restricted to camera gearheads, and it’s hard to imagine buying a new phone without one today. But it took a long time for other phone makers to figure out the utility; Apple introduced its first in 2019, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Woc3q"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/31/13462608/lg-v20-review-price-specs-android"&gt;V20&lt;/a&gt;, released the same year as the G5, had another unique feature that would become a hallmark of the company’s phones for years: an honest-to-God headphone jack in the year that Apple decided to ditch it. And not just any headphone jack — one that worked with a built-in quad DAC designed to boost sound quality and appeal to audiophiles. Did this sell many phones? Well, no. But it became a hallmark of LG’s high-end devices ever since, providing an option for wired headphone enthusiasts who despaired as other phone makers followed Apple’s lead one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG G6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VLvRLb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15188830/lg-g6-2017-review-phone-specs"&gt;2017 G6&lt;/a&gt; got the G-series back on track. It was the first major smartphone released with a now-familiar taller aspect ratio, with an even stronger focus on eliminating bezels than ever before. Of course, not many people noticed as Samsung followed immediately with the similar but sleeker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt; and its “Infinity Display.” Later that year, LG released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16457544/lg-v30-review-design"&gt;V30&lt;/a&gt;, which had a completely new (and very nice) design, but it’s always going to be a hard sell when your most differentiated feature is your (also very nice) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/29/17175466/android-haptic-feedback-is-bad-why"&gt;haptics system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m3Wv"&gt;From here on out, LG’s flagship phones mostly blurred into one. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/22/17363182/lg-g7-thinq-review-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt; was a pretty good facsimile of an iPhone X, even winning an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17591130/editors-choice-lg-g7-thinq-phone-review"&gt;Editor’s Choice designation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Dan Seifert. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17933558/lg-v40-thinq-review-cameras-5-features-battery-screen-photo-quality"&gt;V40&lt;/a&gt; pioneered the now-common triple-camera setup. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;G8X&lt;/a&gt; came with a dual-screen case that, in hindsight, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; really didn’t improve much upon a year later. But all of these phones looked basically identical to each other, and none of their key features were viewed as much more than gimmicks at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3a22s"&gt;For every good idea LG had, there’d be something pointless like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301982/lg-g8-thinq-review-android-phone-snapdragon-855-6-gb-ram-z-camera-sensor"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt;’s vein-sensing “Hand ID” unlock. Despite the company making a big &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/12/17228306/lg-android-software-upgrade-center-research-development"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about a new Software Upgrade Center to increase the pace of Android updates, nothing changed. And in the face of Samsung’s unstoppable marketing machine, LG’s best attempt at a brand identity was to add “ThinQ” to the name of each flagship phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9esvuM"&gt;In its final year, LG’s mobile division did move to address its problems. The Explorer Project was intended to produce more innovative designs, like the beautiful but underpowered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304097/lg-velvet-phone-review-price-us-specs-camera"&gt;Velvet&lt;/a&gt; and the oddball dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;Wing&lt;/a&gt;. At CES this year, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;Rollable&lt;/a&gt; concept phone that it said it planned to take to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky42vU"&gt;That’ll never happen now, and it’s hard to say it’s a huge loss with companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/23/22296817/oppo-mid-air-wireless-charging-x-2021-concept-phone-xiaomi-motorola"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt; likely to pick up the slack with their own versions. But in the context of the US phone market, there’s going to be fewer choices, and whoever ends up accounting for LG’s lost market share is unlikely to be as creative a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AZzaNR"&gt;LG’s phones were rarely, if ever, the best available, but the company did make a significant impact on the smartphone world at large. With its mobile division’s demise, the US market becomes even more homogenous.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8BitDo now makes the best Switch pro controller</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Pro 2 gives you more features for less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="PtFdTk"&gt;Nintendo’s official Pro Controller for the Switch is generally a pretty useful accessory, but it has its problems: the D-pad is unreliable, and it doesn’t really offer any “pro-level” functionality. 8BitDo’s latest controller improves on both of those issues while coming in at a lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJvfV2"&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 is an upgraded version of the SN30Pro Plus, already a well-regarded Switch controller. It uses Bluetooth and also works with PCs and mobile devices; there’s a physical control for flipping between Switch, X-input, D-input, and Mac. You can use it as a wired controller with a USB-C cable, too. I did try using it with my PC, but I feel like it makes more sense on the Switch due to the Japanese-style button layout with B on the bottom and A on the right. Or maybe I’m just too used to using Xbox controllers on the PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uo7CEd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10426176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YpmtFL"&gt;Aesthetically, it looks kind of like a cross between a SNES pad and a PlayStation controller, with a lozenge-shaped body, two handles, and symmetrically aligned analog sticks. The unit I have is decked out in a PlayStation-inspired gray colorway, though there’s also an all-black option and a beige model that evokes the original Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dVAX4"&gt;It’s not a huge controller, but it feels comfortable in my large hands, with easy access to all of the buttons and triggers. Just as importantly for me, the D-pad is good. It feels more or less like a SNES pad, and its placement above the left analog stick makes it more appropriate for games where it’s a primary input option. I’d much rather use the Pro 2 than Nintendo’s Pro Controller for just about any 2D game on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJo6CloJtJrnXDtsyayLpcWHz6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415567/09_l.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iisDXP"&gt;The Pro 2’s key feature over its predecessor is the customizable back buttons that you can press with your middle finger. These are a common element of enthusiast-focused controllers today, from Microsoft’s Elite controllers to third-party offerings like the Astro C40 for the PS4. Sony also released an attachment that brings similar functionality to the DualShock 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc2hiH"&gt;These buttons are useful because they allow you to enter commands without taking your thumbs off the sticks. Most first-person shooters, for example, assign jumping to a face button, which means it can be awkward to activate while aiming at the same time. With controllers like the Pro 2, you can set a back button to work the same way as a given face button, freeing you up to design more flexible control schemes. The Pro 2 makes it much easier to manipulate the camera in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; battle, which might be worth the asking price alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Foy7HA"&gt;The back buttons on the Pro 2 are responsive and clicky, activating with a slight squeeze. You can assign them through 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software app, which is now available for the Pro 2 on iOS and Android as well as PCs. It’s not quite as simple as some pro controller setups that let you remap the buttons directly on the controller itself, but it does support multiple profiles and works well enough. Beside button assignments, the app can also be used to modify the controller’s vibration strength and stick sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFwEbAZkw-2k0rYzhWc_gAL5088=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22415579/DSCF7699.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mEpGK8"&gt;You do miss out on some of the Switch Pro Controller’s features with the 8BitDo Pro 2. While the rumble is solid, it doesn’t feel as precise as Nintendo’s HD Rumble in supported games. The Pro 2 also lacks an NFC reader, so it won’t work with Amiibo figurines. And it can’t be used to power the Switch on, which is common to most third-party controllers across various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uh7XJw"&gt;For $49.99, though, those omissions are understandable. That’s $20 less than Nintendo’s equivalent option, let alone the pro controllers you’d find for the Xbox or PlayStation in the $180–$200 range. And all things considered, I’d take the 8BitDo Pro 2 over the official Nintendo controller most days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0ODBh"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The 8BitDo Pro 2 will start shipping on April 12th.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Loki trailer teases a buddy-cop duo with Owen Wilson across time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfF7-b7ad7W0fER5ZneD_wXGJas=/467x0:2081x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69077304/Screen_Shot_2021_04_05_at_9.57.48_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney / Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kdJpqI"&gt;Marvel’s next spinoff series after &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; will be &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, a show dedicated to the trickster god of Asgard and the brother of Thor. And now we have another trailer, showing off longtime Marvel mainstay Tom Hiddleston in the title role and now a little more information on what exactly he’s been tasked with. The show will premiere on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1018587/9358?subId1=VergeLokiTrailer040521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on June 11th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrvkrb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is another dramatic tonal departure for Marvel, which has set up its spinoff series as experimental dives into various genres. This one feels more in line with the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s love of alternative universe capers, though it’s channeling some serious &lt;em&gt;Umbrella Academy&lt;/em&gt; vibes as Loki is asked by Mobius (Owen Wilson) to help correct the timeline he disturbed when using the Tesseract throughout &lt;em&gt;The Infinity Saga. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AWQiQ6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Loki’s time has come. ⌛ Watch the brand-new trailer for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LOKI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LOKI&lt;/a&gt;, and start streaming the Marvel Studios Original Series June 11 on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6bnfo5C2R1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6bnfo5C2R1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1379056236910366728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g3nUOB"&gt;The series will introduce the Time Variance Authority, the organization responsible for overseeing the multiverse, and surely much more of the mind-bending time travel shenanigans we got during &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. Wilson also pulls off a charmingly devilish Mobius — and Hiddleston is his excellent self, as usual — in a way that has me rather excited to see where Disney and Marvel take this particular storyline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtXvkM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywKdbq"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf"&gt;a ruling on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court found that Google could legally use elements of Oracle’s Java application programming interface (API) code when building Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D00Dr"&gt;“Google’s copying of the API to reimplement a user interface, taking only what was needed to allow users to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, constituted a fair use of that material,” the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-2 opinion, with one justice (Amy Coney Barrett) not taking part in the ruling. It overturned an earlier federal decision, which found that Google’s use of the API had constituted infringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Quezou"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google’s copying of the API...constituted a fair use of that material”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqpz9o"&gt;The court’s opinion concludes that APIs — which let programmers access other code — are significantly different from other kinds of computer programs. “As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas ... and the creation of new creative expression,” Justice Stephen Breyer writes in his opinion. Unlike many other computer programs, Breyer wrote, much of the copied lines’ value came from developers being invested in the ecosystem, rather than the actual operations of the program. Google used the API to let Java programmers build Android apps, which the court declared is a fundamentally transformative use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es5t1p"&gt;“Google copied only what was needed to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment without discarding a portion of a familiar programming language. Google’s purpose was to create a different task-related system for a different computing environment (smartphones) and to create a platform — the Android platform — that would help achieve and popularize that objective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klhM8u"&gt;The decision is meant to be specifically focused on APIs as a category. “We do not overturn or modify our earlier cases involving fair use — cases, for example, that involve “knockoff” products, journalistic writings, and parodies,” writes Breyer. The ruling hinges largely on the ways that API code enables new creative expression, something fair use doctrine is supposed to promote. “The upshot, in our view, is that fair use can play an important role in determining the lawful scope of a computer program copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lff1RM"&gt;In the dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas argued the court was creating an untenable distinction between implementing code (which was established as subject to copyright in a previous ruling) and declaring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6bfuw"&gt;“Congress rejected categorical distinctions between declaring and implementing code,” Thomas wrote. “But the majority creates just such a distinction. The result of this distorting analysis is an opinion that makes it difficult to imagine any circumstance in which declaring code will remain protected by copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdOiZs"&gt;Google and Oracle have been fighting over Android’s Java interoperability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/22/2967626/oracle-vs-google-trial-java-android"&gt;for more than 10 years now&lt;/a&gt;, spanning three trials and two separate appeals. The current incarnation of the case turns on whether Oracle can enforce its copyright over roughly 11,500 lines in Android’s codebase, representing 37 separate APIs. Google developed the APIs independently, but they’re clearly based on equivalent APIs in the Java code, designed to mimic and interoperate with the separate language. Oracle claims the “structure, sequence, and organization” of the Android APIs is so similar as to violate Oracle’s copyright on the Java code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY4K0j"&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4431835/13-1021.Opinion.5-7-2014.1.pdf"&gt;a federal appeals court ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the APIs could be subject to copyright in a controversial decision overturning a ruling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16503076/oracle-vs-google-judge-william-alsup-interview-waymo-uber"&gt;by Judge William Alsup&lt;/a&gt;. (The Supreme Court declined to hear Google’s appeal the following year, letting the appellate ruling stand.) But that decision left open the question of whether Google’s implementation had violated the Java copyright, and Google launched a second phase of the case arguing that the Android APIs constituted fair use. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/oracle-wins-revival-of-billion-dollar-case-against-google"&gt;In 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the same appellate court ruled that Google’s implementation was not fair use, putting the company at risk of up to $8.8 billion in damages. Today’s decision overturns that ruling, allowing Google to continue its use of the Android code without threat of a copyright claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7quTj"&gt;Notably, then-President Trump’s solicitor general had formally petitioned the Supreme Court to leave the appellate ruling in place, effectively &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/483750-trump-administration-backs-oracle-in-supreme-court-battle-against-google"&gt;siding with Oracle&lt;/a&gt; in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwAkA6"&gt;Oral arguments for the Supreme Court case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21506172/oracle-google-java-supreme-court-hearings-oral-arguments-metaphors-qwerty"&gt;were held in October&lt;/a&gt;, turning on a variety of florid metaphors for what the APIs represented. In one exchange, Breyer compared Oracle’s API claims to holding a copyright on the QWERTY keyboard. “If you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters,” Breyer noted, “which really has nothing to do with copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24Ntg1"&gt;Google global affairs SVP Kent Walker praised the decision. “The Supreme Court’s clear ruling is a victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science. The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,” said Walker. “We are very grateful for the support from a wide range of organizations, from the National Consumers League to the American Library Association, as well as from established companies, start-ups, and the country’s leading software engineers and copyright scholars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lM5r8"&gt;Oracle, meanwhile, used the ruling to criticize Google’s dominance in the tech space. “The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater — the barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower. They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can. This behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google’s business practices,” said general counsel and executive vice president Dorian Daley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjrPA5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 5th, 12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Oracle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s QHD gaming monitor is a great upgrade for $300</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwckG3njvcDm6SRBhmQszwbOPUE=/0x0:1155x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69076946/lgultragearlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBMeOs"&gt;If you ask me, $300 for a QHD gaming monitor that has Nvidia’s G-Sync compatibility and a fantastic IPS panel is a great price. That’s how much LG’s UltraGear 27-inch QHD model costs — down $100 from its usual price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F5%2F22367713%2Flg-ultragear-qhd-1440p-nvidia-gsync-gaming-monitor-ips-iottie-airfly-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLD2QXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This monitor has a subtle design and slim bezels, and in terms of features, it has a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color spectrum. In terms of ports, it has two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm output for desktop speakers or headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UFzn5"&gt;For those lucky enough to have gotten a new Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics card, or a powerful AMD GPU for their PC, or who have an Xbox Series X, a 1440p gaming monitor like this is a must-own piece of tech. Games will look better, and everything else will look sharper than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WgUwTs"&gt;The AirFly Pro Bluetooth receiver / transmitter from Twelve South &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z13G1P5/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $41 right now at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (usually $55). This model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;got top marks from Dieter Bohn compared to a few other popular transmitters&lt;/a&gt; that make it easier to pair your Bluetooth headphones to, say, in-flight entertainment or tech like a Nintendo Switch. Unlike some others, it features USB-C recharging and long battery life. In addition, its 3.5mm cord is integrated, so you won’t fear losing it. I know most of us still aren’t flying around right now, but this could be a good gadget investment for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
