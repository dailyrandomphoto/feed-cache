    <title>Invest at PayPal could compete with Robinhood and Square’s retail stock trading </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlZLgc"&gt;The next platform to host a rush on stocks like GameStop and AMC could be PayPal, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/paypal-is-looking-to-launch-a-stock-trading-platform-for-its-customers.html"&gt;CNBC reports the company hired a brokerage industry vet to lead the effort&lt;/a&gt;. CNBC points out that Rich Hagen served as Ally Invest president after that company acquired a startup he co-founded called TradeKing, and now &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richjhagen/"&gt;his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; lists him as the CEO of Invest at PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYeBM1"&gt;The meme stock trading action of the last year may have convinced PayPal it can’t let Robinhood or Square take over the market of retail investors who want to easily trade individual stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrBmPm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557419/robinhood-finra-fine-70-million"&gt;Regulatory slaps on the wrist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;financial nihilism&lt;/a&gt; haven’t stalled activity on those apps. However, it may be a while before PayPal is a tool in the arsenal of r/WallStreetBets. PayPal’s CEO told CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the company has plans for additional financial services in the future, including investment capabilities, while at least one anonymous source told the outlet it’s “unlikely” the feature will be available this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DrLupo is the latest streamer to move from Twitch to YouTube Gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Off Court At The 2019 Australian Open" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veCQMEfVqzSvuTtWRbEluv9TszQ=/0x0:4976x3317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793846/1124891630.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Matt King / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cw4ys3"&gt;Streamer Ben “DrLupo” Lupo has signed a deal to stream exclusively on YouTube Gaming, following in the footsteps of other well-known streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063683/valkyrae-twitch-youtube-100-thieves"&gt;Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter&lt;/a&gt; in moving from Twitch to YouTube. Lupo’s first YouTube Gaming stream will take place on August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64PoLQ"&gt;Lupo already has a sizable presence on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNF0LEQ2abMr0PAX3cfkAMg"&gt;with more than 1.7 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. But in switching to the Google-owned platform, he’s moving on from his large audience on Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drlupo"&gt;where he has 4.5 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSIH1d"&gt;A Loaded PR representative declined to comment on the terms of Lupo’s YouTube Gaming deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;In December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Lupo signed a deal with Twitch that was reported to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1204448185785208833"&gt;worth millions of dollars per year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hj1lqf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Jack “CouRage” Dunlop and Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter have seen success on YouTube Gaming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSDTjy"&gt;While big-name streamers aren’t signing splashy exclusivity deals quite as often as they used to in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins’ defection from Twitch to Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, that’s likely in part because Mixer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down by Microsoft in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the potential number of places to go is one platform fewer. (Blevins, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430767/ninja-twitch-homecoming-return-mixer-shroud"&gt;has returned to streaming exclusively on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V60daE"&gt;Both Dunlop and Hofstetter have seen success since moving exclusively to YouTube. However, Twitch sees vastly more hours watched than both YouTube Gaming and Facebook Gaming combined, making up nearly 75 percent of total hours watched across all three platforms in the first quarter of this year, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492"&gt;Streamlabs report&lt;/a&gt;. That means Lupo may not see as much viewership on YouTube Gaming as he does on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuuqmiqAdW7tPWqmcx5C6neInFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814729/1_4lFFUZbSZuCWgetM2PbBng.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QByCTJ"&gt;But in signing this exclusivity deal, it seems Lupo sees opportunity with Google’s platform. And in a statement, he suggests the platform will also help him as he “expand[s] my brand through other entertainment initiatives,” so perhaps there’s more that YouTube is offering Lupo we just aren’t aware of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children who take a mix of in-person and online classes. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Distance learners can still run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Zoom will be a large part of university life this semester: many kids will be attending virtual classes, while others will still be meeting with clubs, study groups, and professors as well as hanging out with friends online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple buys classical music streaming service Primephonic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQCZ9Gr0fjFTQSuVqmTBjYhnLmA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793751/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZMern"&gt;Apple Music is pushing more extensively into classical music. Today, Apple announced that it has acquired &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;Primephonic&lt;/a&gt;, a service that specializes in streaming the classical genre, and will incorporate the app’s functionality and playlists into Apple Music. The result will be “a significantly improved classical music experience,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-acquires-classical-music-streaming-service-primephonic%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F30%2F22648604%2Fapple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-streaming-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a standalone Apple Music classical app coming sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBTHxN"&gt;Effective immediately, Primephonic is no longer accepting new customers, and the service as it exists today will shut down on September 7th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X85KIJ"&gt;Apple says Primephonic’s playlists and “exclusive audio content” will be first to be integrated into Apple Music. Down the line, it’ll add “the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn9ZSb"&gt;In a show of how serious Apple is about appealing to classical fans, the company says “a dedicated classical music app” will launch next year that will use Primephonic’s “classical user interface that fans have grown to love.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZrAiO"&gt;Primephonic launched three years ago, and its team says this deal is about scale and reaching more listeners. “As a classical-only startup, we can not reach the majority of global classical listeners, especially those that listen to many other music genres as well,” the company wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.primephonic.com/"&gt;a note on its webpage&lt;/a&gt;. “We therefore concluded that in order to achieve our mission, we need to partner with a leading streaming service that encompasses all music genres and also shares our love for classical music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JPDEw"&gt;According to Primephonic’s FAQ, customers with an active subscription will receive a prorated refund. They’ll also be getting a code to redeem six free months of Apple Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfbxSn"&gt;As I wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;my early review of Apple Music’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, classical lends itself extremely well to Dolby Atmos mixes — so I’m looking forward to the service evolving into a better home for the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple cares about privacy, unless you work at Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_vkm8vk7K3TJmJbPOjZRKE5RhsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793705/acastro_210828_4732_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company has taken a strong stance on safeguarding its customers’ data — but some employees don’t believe it protects theirs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="i72298"&gt;Jacob Preston was sitting down with his manager during his first week at Apple when he was told, with little fanfare, that he needed to link his personal Apple ID and work account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a66Mno"&gt;The request struck him as odd. Like anyone who owns an Apple product, Preston’s Apple ID was intimately tied to his personal data — it connected his devices to the company’s various services, including his iCloud backups. How could he be sure his personal messages and documents wouldn’t land on his work laptop? Still, he was too giddy about his new job as a firmware engineer to care. He went ahead and linked the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7C692k"&gt;Three years later, when Preston handed in his resignation, the choice came back to haunt him. His manager told him to return his work laptop, and — per Apple protocol — said he shouldn’t wipe the computer’s hard drive. His initial worry had come to pass: his personal messages were on this work laptop, as were private documents concerning his taxes and a recent home loan. Preston pushed back, saying some of the files contained highly personal information and there was no reasonable way to make sure they were all removed from the laptop without wiping it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JTFGIN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DHpRb1"&gt;He was told the policy wasn’t negotiable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8jpj8"&gt;Preston’s story is part of a growing tension inside Apple, where some employees say the company isn’t doing enough to protect their personal privacy and, at times, actively seeks to invade it for security reasons. Employees have been asked to install software builds on their phones to test out new features prior to launch — only to find the builds expose their personal messages. Others have found that when testing new products like Apple’s Face ID, images are recorded every time they open their phones. “If they did this to a customer, people would lose their goddamn minds,” says Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fATl5U"&gt;Apple employees also can’t use their work email addresses to sign up for iCloud accounts, so many use their personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rw557J"&gt;The blurring of personal and work accounts has resulted in some unusual situations, including Gjøvik allegedly being forced to hand compromising photos of herself to Apple lawyers when her team became involved in an unrelated legal dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5fNLD"&gt;Underpinning all of this is a stringent employment agreement that gives Apple the right to conduct extensive employee surveillance, including “physical, video, or electronic surveillance” as well as the ability to “search your workspace such as file cabinets, desks, and offices (even if locked), review phone records, or search any non-Apple property (such as backpacks, purses) on company premises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGA1QT"&gt;Apple also tells employees that they should have “no expectation of privacy when using &lt;em&gt;your or someone else’s personal devices for Apple business&lt;/em&gt;, when using Apple systems or networks, or when on Apple premises” (emphasis added). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXwTkm"&gt;Many employees have a choice between getting an Apple-owned phone or having the company pay for their phone plan. But one source tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that trying to maintain two phones can become impractical. In software engineering, certain employees are expected to download a “live-on” program that puts out daily builds with bug fixes. “You can’t have a successful live-on program without people treating these devices exactly the same as a personal phone,” the source says. “So a work device or a work account just won’t cut it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OHPENx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gcIeVu"&gt;None of these policies are unique. Tech companies almost always have rules in place to search employees’ corporate devices, including personal devices used for work. It’s also common practice for tech companies to ask employees to test new software, which could potentially expose personal information. But Apple sets itself apart from other tech giants through its commitment to consumer privacy. As &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-initiative"&gt;Tim Cook said at the CPDP Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in January 2021&lt;/a&gt;, businesses built on buying and selling user data, without the knowledge or consent of consumers, “[degrade] our fundamental right to privacy first, and our social fabric by consequence.” The lack of employee privacy has made the perceived hypocrisy particularly irksome to some workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAgJJd"&gt;Now, as employees begin to push back against a variety of Apple norms and rules, these policies are coming under the spotlight, raising the question of whether the company has done enough to safeguard personal employee data. It might seem like a company obsessed with secrecy would be sympathetic to its employees’ wishes to have confidential information of their own. But at Apple, secrecy requires the opposite: extensive knowledge, and control, over its workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="W0EPAn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fX9LEK"&gt;This is how it starts: a new Apple employee is told during onboarding that collaborating with their colleagues will require them to make extensive use of iCloud storage, and their manager offers a two terabyte upgrade. This will link their personal Apple ID to their work account — in fact, the instructions for accessing this upgrade explicitly say “you must link your personal Apple ID with your AppleConnect work account.” The connection will give them access to collaborative apps like Pages and Numbers that they might need to do their jobs. (Apple employees who do not have a business need to collaborate do not go through this process.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL0ABq"&gt;Employees &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; pause during onboarding and say they want to create a new Apple ID specifically for work or use a different phone. But most do not — it seems a little paranoid, and the Apple instructions say to go ahead and use your personal account. What’s more, most Apple devices don’t support using multiple Apple IDs. To switch between iCloud accounts on an iPhone, you have to completely sign out of one ID and into another — a clunky, disruptive process. It is far easier culturally and technically to simply link personal and work accounts, which adds a new Apple Work folder to the employee’s iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CYWXBP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rsRVfM"&gt;In theory, this Apple Work folder is where all of the collaborative documents for employees are supposed to live in order to keep personal and work files separate. In practice, the owner of a document often forgets to store files in the work folder, and documents quickly become intermingled. In fact, when Apple employees create a document in, say, Pages, the app automatically enters the personal email address used for their Apple ID. “I asked my manager about it and it’s just sort of an issue everyone deals with,” Preston says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ9yZ8"&gt;Employees can choose to not sync certain folders, like their photo libraries. But others, like messages, can be trickier. Apple adopted Slack in 2019, but some teams still use iMessage as a primary way to communicate, which makes opting out of a message sync nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cND06r"&gt;Over the past few weeks, employees have been discussing the difficulty of setting up different Apple IDs to keep work and personal files separate, noting that while it’s possible, there are significant technical hurdles. “I don’t understand why they didn’t create an Apple ID and iCloud account from our work email address during the onboarding process,” one employee said on Slack. “I get mad that I have to use my personal phone to text my boss,” said another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gb5oHV"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KX6B7I"&gt;Concerns about data privacy are not ubiquitous inside Apple. Many employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were aware the company gave itself extensive rights to search their data, but — for various reasons — weren’t overly worried about the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS4l18"&gt;“When I joined Apple, I personally expected it to be pretty invasive and took some serious steps to separate my work and personal life,” one source says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uvat9x"&gt;For other employees, however, the mixing of personal and work data has already had real consequences. In 2018, the engineering team Ashley Gjøvik worked on was involved in a lawsuit. The case had nothing to do with Gjøvik personally, but because she’d worked on a project related to the litigation, Apple lawyers needed to collect documents from her phone and work computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qMBbDh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All data that has your face in it is good data.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjR32s"&gt;Gjøvik asked the lawyers to confirm that they wouldn’t need to access her personal messages. She says her team discouraged the use of two phones; she used the same one for work and personal and, as a result, had private messages on her work device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWh2Gt"&gt;A member of the legal team responded that while the lawyers did not need to access Gjøvik’s photos, they did not want her to delete any messages. During an in-person meeting, Gjøvik says she told the lawyers the messages included nude photos she’d sent to a man she was dating — a sushi chef who lived in Hawaii. Surely, those weren’t relevant to the lawsuit. Could she delete them? She says the lawyers told her no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n70Td0"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JxFw4s"&gt;In 2017, Apple rolled out an app called Gobbler that would allow employees to test Face ID before it became available to customers. The process was routine — Apple often launched new features or apps on employees’ phones, then collected data on how the technology was used to make sure it was ready for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwqUgC"&gt;Gobbler was unique in that it was designed to test face unlock for iPhones and iPads. This meant that every time an employee picked up their phone, the device recorded a short video — hopefully of their face. They could then file “problem reports” on Radar, Apple’s bug tracking system, and include the videos if they found a glitch in the system. “All data that has your face in it is good data,” said an internal email about the project. After rumors of criticism,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Apple eventually changed the codename to “Glimmer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pGlrWf"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Zoe Apple Feature|103688" data-volume-uuid="580d2e156" data-volume-id="103688" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-325" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jV2FDY"&gt;Unlike other Apple features, Glimmer wasn’t automatically installed on employee phones. It required an informed consent form so employees would know what they were getting into. Still, for some people on engineering teams, participation was encouraged — even expected, according to two staff members. Once it was installed, some data that didn’t contain personally identifiable information would automatically upload to Radar, unless employees turned off this setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Pznio"&gt;Apple was careful to instruct employees not to upload anything sensitive, confidential, or private. But it didn’t tell people what was happening with the hundreds of images they didn’t upload in Radar reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMLdGA"&gt;The reports themselves were also a cause for concern. When employees file Radar tickets, they include detailed information about the problems they are seeing. In 2019, Gjøvik filed a ticket about Apple’s photo search capabilities. “If I search for ‘infant’ in my photo library, it returns a selfie I took of myself in bed after laparoscopic surgery to treat my endometriosis,” she wrote, including four images in the ticket. The default sharing settings for the ticket included all of software engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o3fzws"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gprojb"&gt;Radar tickets also are not removable. Even when the tickets are closed, they remain searchable. In training, employees say they are told: “Radar is forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFxerl"&gt;What’s more, when employees file Radar tickets, they are often asked to include diagnostic files, internally called “sysdiagnose” to give Apple more information about the problem. If they are filing a bug about iMessage, they might be asked to install a sysdiagnose profile that exposes their iMessages to the team tasked with fixing the issue. For employees using a live-on device, default settings can mean that, as they are filing a Radar ticket, a sysdiagnose profile is being automatically created in the background, sending data to Apple without the employee realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjiYsZ"&gt;When sysdiagnose profiles are not included, employees have been known to post memes calling out the omission. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/On4EnZwfGWeTJIUzgvtp5knMPOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814656/IMG_3D14F61845E9_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="apGDlX"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g3Kohu"&gt;Gjøvik is currently on administrative leave from Apple due to an ongoing investigation into claims she made about harassment and a hostile work environment. If she leaves the company, she’ll likely face the same conundrum as Jacob Preston, related to the mixing of her personal and work files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujrz0L"&gt;Employees likely wouldn’t care too much about this were it not for another Apple rule that bars them from wiping their devices when they leave the company. If they do, they’ll be in direct violation of their employment agreement, leaving them vulnerable to legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG6d7p"&gt;After Preston gave notice, he received a checklist from his manager that explicitly said: “Do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; wipe or factory reset any Apple owned units (such as laptops, Mac, ipads, and iPhones).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1N0xn"&gt;“Before joining Apple I had a lot of respect for the company,” Preston says. “They’re the one tech company that takes privacy seriously. But then they go and have these policies that are hypocritical and go against their stated values. It’s sort of hard to reconcile. It’s like now that I’m leaving, my privacy isn’t a concern anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6Tj11j"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s parent company acquires VR headset maker Pico</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pico Neo 3 headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDtcCeS1spNipnFMdje8N7VedwA=/0x0:940x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793264/m_carousel_neo3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tmccad"&gt;TikTok parent company ByteDance is acquiring Chinese virtual reality headset maker Pico. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/tiktok-owner-bytedance-acquires-pico-and-takes-first-step-into-virtual-reality.html"&gt;CNBC confirmed the news&lt;/a&gt; today after it was rumored last week and verified by Chinese &lt;a href="https://news.nweon.com/88799"&gt;publication &lt;em&gt;Nweon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. ByteDance told CNBC in a statement that Pico’s “comprehensive suite of software and hardware technologies, as well as the talent and deep expertise of the team, will support both our entry to the VR space and long-term investment in this emerging field,” saying it was “optimistic about the future of VR and its alignment with our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ti8Bih"&gt;Pico is known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13511680/pico-neo-vr-headset-controller-specs-hands-on"&gt;Neo lineup&lt;/a&gt; of standalone virtual reality headsets, most recently the &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/05/pre-order-enterprise-ready-pico-neo-3-starting-from-699/"&gt;Pico Neo 3&lt;/a&gt;. It caters to &lt;a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/05/pre-order-enterprise-ready-pico-neo-3-starting-from-699/"&gt;both consumer and professional&lt;/a&gt; customers, and &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210630005150/en/Facebook-Leads-the-VR-Headset-Market-in-Q1-2021-But-Theres-Plenty-of-Room-for-Others-According-to-IDC"&gt;a June IDC report&lt;/a&gt; estimates that Pico is the third largest maker of VR headsets, following Facebook subsidiary Oculus and Chinese company DPVR. While the consumer-focused Neo 3 launched exclusively in Asia, Pico is slowly expanding its market, with the &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/pico-neo-3-pro-eye-release-date-price/"&gt;business-ready Neo 3 Pro and Neo 3 Pro Eye&lt;/a&gt; set for a North American and European release as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTVq9x"&gt;ByteDance is known primarily as a social app company, thanks to global juggernaut TikTok and China-based Douyin. As CNBC notes, however, it also acquired the major &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/bytedance-takes-on-tencent-with-major-gaming-studio-acquisition.html"&gt;mobile games studio Moonton&lt;/a&gt; in March. It’s got experience releasing hardware as well, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20947721/tiktok-bytedance-smartisan-jianguo-pro-3-release-date-china-price-features"&gt;launched a China-exclusive mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; called the Jianguo Pro 3 in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uURBy"&gt;The Pico acquisition seems unlikely to mix with ByteDance’s TikTok service in the near future. It’s also not clear how the acquisition might affect Pico’s rollout plans. The company has so far avoided direct competition with Oculus — which dominates the global VR market but doesn’t operate within China. But with Facebook intensifying its push into VR, Apple reportedly preparing to enter the market, and Sony preparing a follow-up to its PlayStation VR headset, ByteDance is signaling that it’s also interested in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric robotaxis may not be the climate solution we were led to believe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GM Robot Car Company Cruise" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWAwg9JNctrOYzYxtqpiTx8W4yY=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69793226/1189070698.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n51fWE"&gt;For years, we’ve been told that electric autonomous taxis can help fight climate change by reducing air pollution. But new research from Harvard Law School suggests these supposedly “zero emissions” vehicles could actually exacerbate many of the problems we are facing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hoNOf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1bd9/pdf"&gt;A new study led by Ashley Nunes&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, concluded that fleets of electric autonomous taxis could “dramatically increase energy consumption and emissions that contribute to climate change — not reduce them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vt6sL"&gt;“While electric vehicles themselves have lower emissions than traditional gasoline-powered ones, our work shows that deploying electric robocabs en masse on America’s streets could actually increase the number of trips, miles driven, and overall emissions,” Nunes said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y5Ly7l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our work shows that deploying electric robocabs en masse on America’s streets could actually increase the number of trips, miles driven, and overall emissions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNNs5M"&gt;Transportation is one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, with the most significant share coming from light-duty vehicles, personal cars, vans, trucks, and SUVs. Replacing some of those trips with electric autonomous vehicles operating as part of a ride-hailing fleet could help offset some of those emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neRL2b"&gt;But by studying data from San Francisco, Nunes’ team found that “ubiquitous electric robocabs might erase those energy savings” by increasing demand for rides while also decreasing ride-pooling or carpooling, largely due to their public perception as easy, cheap, and eco-friendly. In other words, more people would be using these cars to get around who might not have otherwise have done so, thanks to their availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMX9st"&gt;“Our work showed that transportation emissions are likely to rise due to the initiation of car trips that — in the absence of electric robocabs — would not be completed, and an increase in the number of Americans who choose to give up sharing rides in favor of using electric robocabs for single occupant trips,” says Nunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uzqcza"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Transportation emissions are likely to rise due to the initiation of car trips that — in the absence of electric robocabs — would not be completed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OHzEHU"&gt;The study cast doubt on assertions from the AV industry that the advent of electric autonomous vehicles would be a net positive for the environment. Kyle Vogt, co-founder, president, and chief technology officer at Cruise, said as much during an event hosted by the National Federation of the Blind back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWtw1d"&gt;“I know AVs will change the way we live and move: they’ll save lives, improve accessibility, reduce emissions and air pollution, and give people back the most important resources: their time and their freedom to go where they want to go when they want to go,” Vogt said, &lt;a href="https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm19/bm1909/bm190906.htm"&gt;according to the transcript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPxV51"&gt;Cruise often touts its commitment to an all-electric fleet — the company only uses battery-powered Chevy Bolts provided by its financial backer, General Motors — as a key factor that distinguishes it from other AV operators. Most other self-driving car companies use a mix of gas-powered, hybrid, and electric vehicles to comprise their fleets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpxjmU"&gt;The media has also helped push the idea that electric robotaxis would counteract the effects of climate change, with overly speculative headlines like “&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/26/ai-weekly-how-self-driving-cars-could-reduce-emissions-eliminate-parking-spots-and-add-1-3-trillion-to-the-u-s-economy/"&gt;How self-driving cars could reduce emissions, eliminate parking spots, and add $1.3 trillion to the US economy&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/brand-connect/ucdavis/driverless-cars-could-be-a-solution-to-climate-change/"&gt;Driverless cars could be a solution to climate change — but two major things have to happen&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhBNzf"&gt;Some AV operators are aware of the conundrum that could arise from the spread of electric robotaxis. Cruise, for example, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;building a purpose-built autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; designed primarily for shared rides. “It’s designed to be comfortable if it’s shared, but if it’s just you, you’ve got so much space in here you can really like stretch out,” Vogt told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HQQqW"&gt;Promoting shared rides would go a long way toward improving the climate profile of autonomous vehicles in the future, the Harvard team concluded. Rather than handing out tax breaks to people who buy EVs, policymakers should consider financial incentives or discounts for people willing to carpool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4R0wOw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Promoting shared rides would go a long way toward improving the climate profile of autonomous vehicles in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amkvnO"&gt;Electric robotaxis would have to be more than “50 percent cleaner than today’s electric cars to reduce emissions, given their anticipated increase in trips,” they said. Cleaning up the electrical grid by eliminating the use of coal and polluting energy sources is another solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czvl5I"&gt;Of course, eliminating the need for car trips altogether by promoting the use of mass transit — or for shorter trips, walking and biking — is the best way to reduce an individual’s overall vehicle miles traveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XuHFS"&gt;Nunes’ study is the latest to poke holes in “zero emissions” claims by the tech and auto industry. A University of Michigan study in 2018 found the shift toward autonomy could &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b04576"&gt;raise (rather than reduce) a vehicle’s energy demands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11116-018-9937-9"&gt;Another research paper&lt;/a&gt; looked at the behavior of households that were offered a free chauffeur service for 60 hours over a seven-day period, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756945/uber-lyft-tnc-vmt-traffic-congestion-study-fehr-peers"&gt;akin to a ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; or a future driverless car. The study participants’ vehicle miles traveled rose by about 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The N64 controller was a weird but essential introduction to joysticks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FoxWXqXMI55fdVqjdaFhU_1XSE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69792992/akrales_210716_4639_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BbmTds"&gt;In the annals of gaming history, there’s no controller better known than the three-pronged piece of plastic that shipped with the Nintendo 64. That’s likely for a few reasons. There’s the unique design, which renders it instantly and unmistakably recognizable as the N64’s gamepad. There’s the popularity of the console, which helped cement Nintendo as one of the definitive names in gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRf5yV"&gt;But the most important part of the N64 controller isn’t the design or the box it attached to: it was the joystick, which introduced millions to a new way of controlling games and paved the way for modern 3D gaming that’s virtually standard today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p8VDVp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo didn’t invent the joystick, but it did popularize it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJyqM0"&gt;Nintendo didn’t invent the joystick or the idea of using it for games, but it did popularize the joystick as a default control option for mainstream 3D games in a way that no one else had done before. Prior to the N64, joysticks were limited largely to flight simulator enthusiasts looking for the most realistic platform to mirror actual flight (although earlier consoles like the Atari 2600 did feature a joystick input, albeit for 2D gaming.) But the N64 controller offered a joystick as the main control scheme for &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;type of game and placed it front and center in players’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o0LY3fPRuDHHzf8-liaj3K4TaXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756844/akrales_210716_4639_0018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xLV7mn"&gt;One reason for that decision was the shift to 3D gaming, a change Nintendo helped usher in with the N64. Moving around a polygonal three-dimensional world meant players needed the ability to navigate more freely than what a traditional D-pad (designed for grid-like pixels on past consoles) would allow. It’s something reflected in my favorite design cue of the N64 joystick: the octagonal well it rests in, which subtly cues players toward the eight cardinal directions they can tilt the stick and subsequently move their character on-screen. (It’s also a detail Nintendo stuck with on its succeeding consoles up until the Wii U.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ox8Tp"&gt;But the magic of the N64’s controller is how Nintendo used the design to teach players how to use the new joystick and navigate in new planes. The strange-looking third controller grip allowed the N64 controller to be held on the two outside grips like a “regular” controller, but the center-mounted stick encourages players to view it as the primary control scheme. And the textured rubber grip rests naturally under your thumb, making it easy to tilt it in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMhh2X"&gt;The joystick also allowed for more subtle movement than a traditional D-pad. In &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, players are introduced to the idea that they can push the joystick hard to run but tilt it lightly to walk. Later on in the game, they can even use it to fly freely in three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DChOCAHMXuzJkVdz6uXFuDmLuHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22756843/akrales_210716_4639_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B8zepK"&gt;The hardware had issues. The mechanism was prone to wearing out and loosening over time, requiring that they be properly maintained, lubricated, and replaced. But it’s important to remember that it was also a first-generation product, released at a time when Nintendo’s biggest competitors, the original PlayStation and Sega Saturn, only had shipped with old-fashioned D-pads. (Both would later release controllers with joysticks after the N64 was released.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGPSDE"&gt;The N64 controller is also very clearly a transition point. Its design looks almost like an SNES controller grew some extra appendages, and the direction pad and face buttons still easily allow for developers and players who were uneasy about the new control scheme to avoid it. There was only the single analog stick, making camera control a frustration in some games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YRP2LF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the PlayStation’s DualShock shaped modern controllers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20978071/playstation-dualshock-controllers-modern-shape-design-ps5-25th-anniversary"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="erL5Ed"&gt;It wouldn’t be until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20978071/playstation-dualshock-controllers-modern-shape-design-ps5-25th-anniversary"&gt;Sony released the Dual Analog Controller in 1997&lt;/a&gt; that the modern double-analog stick design that’s still used on virtually every major controller and gamepad today would arrive. Even Nintendo would go on to offer its own version of PlayStation’s face button / D-pad / dual-stick / triggers layout with the GameCube, the Wii Classic controller, the Wii U, and the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UCWyD"&gt;But the N64’s lone joystick was a starting point, a bridge from the pixelated consoles of the past to the ultra-powerful PlayStations and Xboxes we have today — teaching generations of players a new way to think about gaming and moving in a digital space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tu4SIZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 30th, 12:30pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added mention of the Atari 2600 as predating the Nintendo 64 for console joysticks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSMdgG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opaYkX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZEFmL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CLLsv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgnMJP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TLNUp"&gt;It’s almost unspoken wisdom at this point that you should think twice about buying some costly Apple products in the late summer months, as the company usually announces new stuff during its annual September event. But if you really need or want an iPad with a few pro-level features (but without the high cost of the iPad Pro), this $100 off deal at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748634717956796230" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; on the iPad Air released in 2020 might be what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SztUVq"&gt;Normally $599 for the 64GB version, you can get it now for $499, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet. This model has a 10.9-inch display, and like the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, it charges via USB-C and supports the latest Apple Pencil. Uniquely, it sports a Touch ID sensor within the power button along its side that can unlock the tablet with your fingerprint. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rC38DY"&gt;At Newegg, Gigabyte’s Aero 15 gaming/creator-focused laptop is just $1,249 after a $100 mail-in rebate. It originally sold for $1,799, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F34-233-446" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but today you’ll pay $1,349&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the rebate. For the price, the Aero 15 nets you more impressive specs than many other competing models, including a 15.6-inch 4K OLED screen, an Intel Core i7-11800H processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics chip (maximum graphics power at 105W), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It’s not without a few shortcomings, though, like its less-than-ideal nose cam webcam, the short battery life, and that it can get toasty. This is the KD model, but you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22559671/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;read our review of the similar XD version.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5SZRM"&gt;If you buy this laptop, you’ll get complimentary digital copies of &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Humankind&lt;/em&gt;. And, don’t forget to send in the mail-in rebate to get your $100 off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0zN28n"&gt;If you want to treat yourself to the high-end headphone upgrade you deserve, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750551206747448553" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones are $180 at Best Buy today&lt;/a&gt;, and today only. These originally sold for $349 when they were released a few years ago, and they’ve only dropped substantially in price because their successor, the similar-looking WH-1000XM4, launched last year. Comparatively, the newer model has some features up on the XM3, including support for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections and a sensor that can automatically play or pause your content when you put them on or take them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHZVII"&gt;This $180 price at Best Buy isn’t the best-ever deal, but it’s close. We once saw them selling from Best Buy for $170 in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yKu56c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DH1bHo"&gt;It’s understandable if $180 might be too costly for an impulse buy. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HMWZBXC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Perhaps Anker’s Soundcore Q30 wireless headphones with active noise cancellation for $60 &lt;/a&gt;might be a better choice for you. Normally $80, these headphones are discounted as part of an Amazon Deal of the Day that expires at the end of the day. I can’t personally vouch for these, but they seem great for the cost, with Anker claiming up to 40 hours of playback per charge in noise cancellation mode, as well as support for two Bluetooth devices simultaneously. They even come folded up in their own zip-up hard case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dzSPdu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10725674"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How police laid down a geofence dragnet for Kenosha protestors</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;ATF investigators used a controversial technique to investigate arson incidents connected to the 2020 police protests&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tirtaZ"&gt;On August 23rd, 2020, police shot Jacob Blake four times in the back in Kenosha, Wisconsin — and within hours, the streets were full of protestors. The National Guard was activated the following morning, and the next week would see &lt;a href="https://abc7chicago.com/kenosha-shooting-protest-looting-fires/6402998/"&gt;as many as 40 buildings destroyed&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two people shot dead by a counter-protestor before order was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZidnm"&gt;But while the events of that week have been closely watched, many of the law enforcement tactics used to respond to those protests are only now coming to light. A series of six newly unsealed warrants (&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051458-kenosha-warrant-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051459-kenosha-warrant-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051460-kenosha-warrant-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051461-kenosha-warrant-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051462-kenosha-warrant-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051463-kenosha-warrant-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/08/26/google-gave-feds-data-on-phones-located-at-kenosha-riot-arsons/?sh=7040672c1dea"&gt;some previously reported by &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show a persistent effort to use Google’s location services to identify Android users in the vicinity of arson incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3LUPU"&gt;Issued in quick succession on September 3rd, the warrants came from a team of 50 arson investigators from the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, deployed to Kenosha to prosecute property damage cases connected to the protests. Using the warrants, The agents targeted seven different geographical zones, asking to identify anyone located within that area during a span that could stretch as long as two hours. The result was a kind of location dragnet, spread over some of the busiest times and locations in the first days of the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="hTS5tv"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1-DslUXsAHgihu4uvATP8oh4rdV110Cl4" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94Acpn"&gt;Searching location data for users in a particular area — called a geofence warrant — is a controversial practice that has become widespread in recent years. In one incident in 2020, the data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21169533/florida-google-runkeeper-geofence-police-privacy"&gt;implicated a bicyclist&lt;/a&gt; in the burglary of a home he often rode by. But while the technique is always controversial, it’s particularly alarming when it’s used in conjunction with a mass protest event, inevitably sweeping up innocent civilians alongside suspected arsonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcjT9V"&gt;Jennifer Lynch, who leads the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Street Level Surveillance project, says the fact that police were able to obtain the six warrants with little pushback from the courts shows how dangerous geofence warrants can be. “We know there were hundreds if not thousands of people in the area who were engaged in lawful protest activity,” says Lynch. “It’s unconstitutionally broad. There’s no probable cause alleged in any of the warrants that would support a search encompassing so many people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJGE1H"&gt;Most concerning to privacy advocates, the warrants contain no acknowledgement of the risks of incidental data collection or provisions that would limit the privacy risks of such a request. “When you have an investigation that necessarily involves the collection of information on protests,” says Brett Kaufman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberty Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, “protections need to be in place to both limit collection on the front end and establish the destruction of incidental data afterwards. Otherwise, you’re just giving the government carte blanche.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwwVOA"&gt;The six geofence warrants issued after the Kenosha protests vary widely in their specificity. The most particular request draws on video footage and an eyewitness account of an attempted arson at a TCF Bank just southwest of the city center. That evidence allowed police to narrow the timeframe to a 22-minute period when someone on the north side of the bank broke its windows and hurled in flaming objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSuasSdLLTKoVn9rvtuBSlvirUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22814500/Screen_Shot_2021_08_30_at_8.47.51_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The area around the Kenosha public library, as marked by police. Under the terms of &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21051459-kenosha-warrant-2" target="_blank"&gt;the warrant&lt;/a&gt;, any users detected in this area between 1AM and 3AM on August 25th would be flagged to investigators.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXRoHq"&gt;Other warrants are far more general. A different warrant looks at a suspected arson of the Kenosha Public Library, based on lighter fluid and rags that were discovered in a northeast window well alongside minimal fire damage. Without direct witnesses to the fire, police set a two-hour window and a geofence covering the middle third of the downtown’s largest public park space. It was a significant span of time on the busiest night of the protest in an area that provided a natural meeting place for anyone who had taken to the streets that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze1LQB"&gt;The near-certainty of incidental collection is particularly alarming for Lynch. “What’s not provided in the warrants is any discussion of how many people were in that geographic area at the time covered by the warrant,” she says. “Those people were not connected to the arsons under investigation and there’s absolutely no reason law enforcement should be able to get access to their location information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLzeVT"&gt;Notably, this isn’t the first time the technique has been used in the wake of a police protest. In May 2020, Minneapolis police &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/"&gt;used a similar technique&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the vandalization of an Autozone store during protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQAhkh"&gt;While many devices collect location data, Google has become a particular target for geofence warrants because of its data retention practices. iOS stores location data in an anonymized and ephemeral way that makes it less accessible to court orders. Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/1/11824118/google-android-location-data-police-warrants"&gt;been reluctant to adopt such a system for Android&lt;/a&gt;, in part because of the data’s value for targeted advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4SbqQ"&gt;The last pages of the warrants show a particular procedure put in place by Google in an effort to address the privacy risks of the system, although much of the process would take place outside of the oversight of the court. Under the system, Google first produces a series of location points, identified with timestamps and unique IDs but no further identifiable information. Once presented with that list, law enforcement “may, at its discretion, identify a subset of the devices,” the warrant reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLg0he"&gt;But while Google’s system could potentially narrow the scope of the warrant, there’s no guidance for how the requests would be narrowed in practice. Most importantly, there’s no mechanism to stop law enforcement from routinely asking to identify every device ID provided, and Google would have no grounds to resist such a request once the warrant has been issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tqkhc"&gt;As a result, critics of geofence warrants see the system as offering little meaningful protection. “It’s a little preposterous to have Google doing its own assessment of what the constitution requires,” says Kaufman. “The rules that govern this kind of data do not come from a private company. They come from the constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eajA3j"&gt;Kaufman sees the problem as particularly urgent given the rapid growth of geofence warrant requests. Google served more than 11,000 geofence warrants in 2020, according to a transparency report &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/google-geofence-warrants/"&gt;released by the company earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority coming from state and local jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfm74w"&gt;“It really is an alarming development that this has expanded so rapidly,” says Kaufman. “The courts need to start paying particular attention to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TT8Pcn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A previous version of this piece said Jacob Blake was shot during a traffic stop. In fact, police were responding to a 911 call. The Verge regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
