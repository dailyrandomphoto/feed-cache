    <title>Microsoft will require proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter buildings in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Microsoft Campus Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_URPiM1gKHtGkIUXzVSmW1rsWa8=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672140/1234212446.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NO65G8"&gt;Microsoft has informed employees that it will require proof of vaccination for anyone entering a Microsoft building in the US starting in September. Employees who have a medical condition or a protected reason, such as religion, that prevents them from getting a vaccine can get a special accommodation. The company has also pushed its full office reopening date from September to “no earlier than October 4th, 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsmSMK"&gt;Here is the company’s full statement, shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WdRDII"&gt;As we have done since the beginning of the pandemic, we continue to closely track new developments and adapt our plans as this situation evolves, keeping employee health and safety top of mind. Based on our continued consultation with health and data experts, our earliest date for the full opening of our U.S. worksites will be no earlier than October 4, 2021. Starting in September, we’ll also require proof of vaccination for all employees, vendors, and any guests entering Microsoft buildings in the U.S., and will have an accommodation process in place for employees. We continue to review the situation on a local basis in each region/country/state where we work and will adjust dates and policies as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7fnqA"&gt;Staff who are caregivers to immunosuppressed people or are parents with children too young to get the vaccine will be able to work from home until January, Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wn3K7C"&gt;Microsoft’s announcements follow a surge in COVID-19 cases around the country and stricter policies put in place by other tech companies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606444/facebook-mask-requirement-employees-covid-19-delta"&gt;Facebook is requiring all US employees to wear masks in offices&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;all employees are vaccinated against COVID-19 when they return to offices&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook expects to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-says-track-reopen-all-us-offices-by-october-2021-06-09/"&gt;fully reopen in October&lt;/a&gt;. Google will also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598316/google-vaccination-requirement-return-offices-covid-19-delta-variant"&gt;require employees to be vaccinated before they can return to the office&lt;/a&gt; and has delayed that return to October 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get the Xbox Wireless headset and controller together and save $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Xbox Wireless headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsZsMrP6Z2FXnsXs0rwEOinEcRM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672122/cfaulkner_210311_4469_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tSeyDE"&gt;Online retailer Antonline is hosting bundles that include Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Headset and one of the new first-party Xbox wireless controllers for $25 less than it’d cost to purchase each item separately. There’s a bundle with the headset paired with &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431921"&gt;a pulse red controller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431922"&gt;a shock blue controller&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headsets+Earsets/1431825"&gt;one with an electric volt controller&lt;/a&gt;. Each are selling for $140 right now, and Antonline suggests acting fast as it told us that deals including this headset tend to sell out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNBbYr"&gt;This bundle isn’t just a good deal, it’s a way to get your hands on the elusive Xbox Wireless Headset that has frequently gone in and out of stock since it released. Not to mention, it’s an incredible headset that should make most Xbox owners (or PC users with an Xbox wireless adapter) pretty happy. It features a Surface Headphones-like design with twistable dials on the ear cups for adjusting volume and game / chat audio. You can also pair a device like a phone via Bluetooth so you can chat and listen to game audio simultaneously. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwLWBm"&gt;As for the controller, these are some of the wilder colors that Microsoft has released. These are the newer models that have the share button for Xbox Series X / S consoles, as well as a USB-C charging port (and cable included). It can connect to other devices like the iPad, iPhone, or Android devices via Bluetooth, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is now available on LG smart TVs in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mzpLAYavmEM9wexKzxsatWHLOvQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672078/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KCGSw2"&gt;Having already brought it to pretty much every other streaming device and platform, today WarnerMedia announced that HBO Max is now available on LG smart TVs in the United States. The US rollout follows Latin America and the Carribean, where HBO Max came to LG sets in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Vs0BX"&gt;HBO Max can be downloaded from LG’s channel store on TVs running the company’s webOS software. If you’ve enabled voice controls, you can also say “HBO Max” into your TV’s remote to open the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96gZ2w"&gt;To anyone using a streaming device or game console to access their favorite services, this news might not matter much; HBO Max is easy to find on Apple TV, Chromecast with Google TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Xbox or PlayStation. But if you’re someone who sticks with the TV’s native apps, this fills what was a significant hole in the services that are available on LG’s webOS platform. Now every major service is accounted for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpYyPt"&gt;WarnerMedia notes that today’s launch on LG smart TVs comes just in time for the August 5th premiere of &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, which “will be available on the platform for 31 days at&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;no additional cost to subscribers in 4K Ultra HD, HDR10 and Dolby Vision.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get a Touch ID-equipped Magic Keyboard without buying a whole iMac now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y3a7_JZxg5joX8tqJa7KD4EjT-8=/0x0:1971x1314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671811/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_10.05.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0WZyP2"&gt;It’s taken a few months, but Apple is now selling the new, Touch ID-equipped version of its Magic Keyboard for anyone to buy, starting &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK293LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607386%2Fapple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at $149 for the standard version&lt;/a&gt; and $179 for a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK2C3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-with-touch-id-and-numeric-keypad-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607386%2Fapple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full-sized model with a numpad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-purchase/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF6A4u"&gt;The Touch ID keyboard was introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;alongside the M1 iMac earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but at the time, the only way to get one was to buy a new computer. Now, though, anyone can buy one of the new keyboards, albeit with one key caveat: the standalone models are only available in Apple’s usual white / aluminum color scheme, instead of the more colorful models that come with the brightly hued iMacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rDtAOl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iMac M1 review: the all-in-one for almost everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u7anwR"&gt;And for those who &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have their accessories match, Apple is also selling &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK2D3AM%2FA%2Fmagic-trackpad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607386%2Fapple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the updated Magic Trackpad&lt;/a&gt; for $129, with the more rounded corners that better match the similar curved keyboard corners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajM00a"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t used the standalone release as an opportunity to switch to a more standardized cable: both the keyboards and the trackpad still use Lightning ports to charge, and include a woven Lightning to USB-C cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Yz3t"&gt;As was the case with the Magic Keyboard model that shipped with the M1 iMac, the standalone Touch ID keyboards still will only let you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397196/magic-keyboard-touch-id-m1-mac-macbook-intel"&gt;use the biometric sensor&lt;/a&gt; with an M1 Mac — a list that includes Apple’s recent MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW223O"&gt;That makes the newly available standalone keyboard particularly useful for owners of the M1 Mac Mini, given that it’s the only M1-based computer that doesn’t include some form of Touch ID biometric security out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The infrastructure deal could create pipelines for captured CO2  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Members Of Congress Work On Infrastructure Legislation On Capitol Hill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDlxXET5zt-6WM8SbfgDiU-CfIA=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671633/1233622087.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) walks back to his office after a bipartisan group of Senators and White House officials came to an agreement over the Biden administrations proposed infrastructure plan at the U.S. Capitol on June 23, 2021 in Washington, DC.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0mrQjt"&gt;A new generation of pipelines could be born out of the bipartisan infrastructure deal making its way through Congress. But instead of hauling oil and gas, the pipelines would carry planet-heating carbon dioxide. The massive bill would allocate funding for new infrastructure devoted to capturing carbon dioxide, and transporting it to places where it can be buried underground or used in products like carbonated &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/direct-air-carbon-capture-global-thermostat/"&gt;soda&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCw1wM"&gt;Carbon capture technology aims to scrub CO2 directly at the source of emissions — but it’s remained controversial among climate activists, with many seeing it as a false solution that distracts from emission reduction goals. But Congress’ new bipartisan infrastructure plan would invest billions of dollars into the idea, committing the US to ambitious carbon capture and removal schemes that have never been attempted at this large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ArX8rt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The infrastructure bill has opened the floodgates for carbon capture piping.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqpXsE"&gt;“The infrastructure bill has opened the floodgates for carbon capture piping. Watch out,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/envirolawprof/status/1422247810246713363"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Alan Ramo, professor emeritus at Golden Gate University School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDqFyO"&gt;The new provisions focus mostly on using carbon capture and removal to tackle industrial emissions, rather than emissions from the power sector. The Biden Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404056/climate-tech-joe-biden-summit-carbon-capture-green-hydrogen"&gt;has particularly encouraged carbon capture&lt;/a&gt; for industries like cement and steel, which are difficult to electrify and decarbonize. (Cement alone is responsible for 8 percent of global CO2 emissions.) Focusing on those industries might keep carbon capture from being used as a way to extend the life of coal plants or other heavy-emitting power sources, a problem that’s come up with &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93y8dv/the-oil-industrys-new-climate-change-solution-is-more-pipelines?utm_medium=social+&amp;amp;utm_source=VICE_Twitter"&gt;carbon capture technologies used in the power sector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVcyng"&gt;The new infrastructure bill would fund a sort of network for industrial carbon capture and storage. There’s already been significant work on scrubber technology that removes carbon dioxide at the source, so the new bill directs much of its funding at building a pipeline network that would can carry that CO2 away from the initial emissions point. The bill also funds projects that could serve as a destination for that CO2, either using it in commercial products or injecting into the ground for storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0CqJw"&gt;The full text of the bill, which senators released on August 1st, recasts the suite of emerging carbon capture and removal technologies as essentially a new type of critical infrastructure. “Carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure share similar barriers to deployment previously faced by other types of critical national infrastructure, such as high capital costs and chicken-and-egg challenges, that require Federal and State support, in combination with private investment, to be overcome,” the bill reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OD9U2g"&gt;All in all, the bipartisan infrastructure package earmarks more than $8.58 billion for carbon capture and removal. Much of the money is split between funding infrastructure for transporting carbon dioxide and finding a final destination for it. The Department of Energy would get $100 million to engineer “transport infrastructure,” aka pipelines for moving CO2. There’s another $2.1 billion to provide low-interest loans and grants for carbon dioxide transportation infrastructure projects from 2022 to 2026.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiDYeH"&gt;The bill would also give the DOE $2.5 billion over five years to develop “commercial large-scale” projects to safely store CO2. It sets aside funds to permit wells for burying carbon dioxide deep in geologic formations. The bill specifically eyes the outer continental shelf — the offshore area beyond states’ jurisdiction — as one place for carbon sequestration and allows the Department of Interior to permit carbon storage projects there. The bill also creates a grant program for states and local governments to buy and use products made with captured carbon, which might include things like concrete and plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpwQGs"&gt;The bill also envisions four regional hubs across the US for “direct air capture” plants — facilities that draw carbon dioxide down directly from the atmosphere. Over the next five years, $3.5 billion would go toward these “regional hubs,” each capable of drawing down at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually (roughly as much as 120,000 homes in the US might generate from their energy use each year). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Operations At A Carbon Engineering Direct Air Capture Pilot Facility" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7yrrk6kGOknt6sYhbZB27Qg-Gk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758193/1186605536.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technicians inspect the direct air capture system at the Carbon Engineering Ltd. pilot facility in Squamish, British Columbia, Canada, on Monday, Nov. 4th, 2019. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JLw8Cj"&gt;Carbon capture and removal is still expensive and at relatively early stages of development, which means it can likely only be developed with significant government funding. And there’s been even less attention paid to the pipeline infrastructure to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B50EZJ"&gt;“The problem is who pays for this giant pipeline initially, when there only are a handful of projects,” says Noah Deich, president of the nonprofit Carbon180, which advocates for the carbon removal technologies. “That’s what the legislation is incentivizing essentially, to build the big pipelines from the beginning so that it overcomes that chicken and egg issue and gets more and more of these industrial projects happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zo7nbt"&gt;But critics still worry that a focus on carbon capture and removal takes away from efforts to wean economies off fossil fuels in the first place, which puts a stop to carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants that usually accompany it. Hundreds of environmental groups sent a &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20072021/democrats-climate-infrastructure-legislation-carbon-capture-storage/"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Biden last month calling carbon capture “a dangerous distraction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGsN3k"&gt;The groups also warned that it would take money away from other important environmental efforts. The bipartisan infrastructure bill ended up including &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-climate-environment-and-nature-bills-e0d52ee9e29f72b1bee85c47fa7ae878?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=146128964&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--67RE-sezW7j-Q2YzbVqzWLuXTxIrY3zB28n2QWK7x2bTpIJ2-41eSdLmX4wGkNSQ5XVHrQ6mlSduZRyBB_Vkqf3A1wszFIpRsPlzLdDO8Q8dL2kw&amp;amp;utm_content=146128964&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;a lot less&lt;/a&gt; funding for climate action and environmental cleanup than the Biden administration proposed earlier this year. But the infrastructure package includes much of what advocates for carbon capture and removal had asked for in an earlier bill called the &lt;a href="https://carboncapturecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SCALE-Act_Fact-Sheet-1.pdf"&gt;SCALE Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOJv6j"&gt;The infrastructure bill provides “minimal support” for a renewable energy transition while “squandering” billions on carbon capture, Carroll Muffett, the president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a corporate giveaway, the energy provisions in the Infrastructure bill are a massive success. As a response to the climate emergency, they are a dismal failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="JRHjXM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like pipelines for fossil fuels, there are risks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tg6ckE"&gt;There are also fears around the pipelines themselves. CO2 pipelines would probably be concentrated in industrial areas, and thus would be less sprawling than pipelines used for fossil fuels. But that could add an extra burden on neighborhoods already overloaded with industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlfYyL"&gt;And like pipelines for fossil fuels, there are risks that come with that infrastructure potentially failing. CO2 that’s captured is moved at high concentrations under high pressure. That makes it a potential asphyxiant if the infrastructure moving it fails. When a pipeline carrying CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in Mississippi &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2020/02/27/yazoo-county-pipe-rupture-co-2-gas-leak-first-responders-rescues/4871726002/"&gt;ruptured last year&lt;/a&gt;, 45 people were treated at a hospital. A sheriff’s investigator described sick people acting “&lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2020/02/27/yazoo-county-pipe-rupture-co-2-gas-leak-first-responders-rescues/4871726002/"&gt;like zombies&lt;/a&gt;” after the incident.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMDQEC"&gt;“Transporting and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) involves a massive network of perilous pipelines connected to underground injection sites, each with their own set of dangers,” the July letter from environmental groups to Biden reads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s Tab P11 Pro with an OLED screen is just $310 at eBay</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BxDLf5"&gt;There are a smattering of deals happening across the web. Some products we’ve covered are seeing some of the lowest prices yet. Like an 11.5-inch tablet with an OLED screen. For a limited time, Lenovo is discounting its Tab P11 Pro tablet that has a vivid OLED screen from its usual $500 price down to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F174820374306%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607346%2Flenovo-tab-samsung-galaxy-buds-logitech-gaming-mouse-deal-sale-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just $310 through Lenovo’s official eBay page&lt;/a&gt;. This is the base model that has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GgzJ0"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert mentioned in the review of this product that this tablet is great for watching movies on, with its display and quad speakers packing a punch. This model is set to receive Android 11 in October 2021, and it will receive security updates through late 2023, &lt;a href="https://support.lenovo.com/ca/en/solutions/ht501098-android-upgrade-matrix"&gt;according to Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451264/lenovo-tab-p11-pro-tablet-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="upSXOU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10683294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XPSkB"&gt;It’s also a great day to score discounts on Samsung wireless earbuds. Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live in the bold, mystic blue colorway &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F194202087189%2F%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607346%2Flenovo-tab-samsung-galaxy-buds-logitech-gaming-mouse-deal-sale-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available refurbished directly through Samsung via eBay for just $70&lt;/a&gt;. These originally sold for $170, and seeing them for $100 new would be a deal worth leaping for. Samsung says these come in “like new” condition in their original packaging, and they have a two-year warranty. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of this model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0N9w4L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kAwN9o"&gt;If you don’t want to shop at Woot, Amazon’s Warehouse for used and refurbished products is also offering great deals. Per &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15194164-amazon-warehouse-20-discount-off-select-items?src=frontpage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can get 20 percent off (discount applies at checkout) on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B6Y618/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=galaxy+buds+live&amp;amp;m=A2L77EE7U53NWQ&amp;amp;qid=1627995103&amp;amp;s=warehouse-deals&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Galaxy Buds Live in multiple colors&lt;/a&gt;, and the final price should equal or beat the deal on eBay. This 20 percent off deal applies to most products within Amazon’s Warehouse, so go ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=warehouse-deals&amp;amp;bbn=16059675011&amp;amp;ascsubtag=2ba4c818f45911eb8dd13ebc8cc252b30INT"&gt;type in your dream product on the search bar at this page&lt;/a&gt; to see if you can score a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Hero on the left is discounted today. It shares many features in common with the pricier wireless G502 Lightspeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U5RggM"&gt;If you’ve been looking for an affordable gaming mouse that’s stacked to the nines with buttons and has premium features like removable weight and a free-spinning scroll wheel, you’re in luck today. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s beloved G502 Hero wired gaming mouse is $38 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down from its usual $45 or so price (Amazon says it will be “in stock soon,” so it may not ship immediately). It has a lot in common with the wireless G502 Lightspeed mouse that usually costs more than twice as much. The button layout, the build quality, and the performance are very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A8nCRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="98lyc8"&gt;Here are a few other deals that might be of interest to you:&lt;/p&gt;

These headphones normally cost $549, but the price has been falling slightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sPdgRz"&gt;Also at Woot, &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142085?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fkingston-512gb-microsdxc-memory-card-adapter-5%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_2_3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 512GB microSD card from Kingston&lt;/a&gt; costs just $54 (normally priced at $80). This is one of the lowest prices that I’ve seen for a microSD card with a massive amount of storage capacity. Samsung and SanDisk’s competing cards are about $70 at Amazon right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IDgnJL"&gt;If you live near a Micro Center store, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/630284/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-vermeer-38ghz-8-core-am4-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included?storeid=071"&gt;you can reserve one of AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800X processors for the lowest price yet&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $450, it’s $360 now, and you can save an additional $20 if you purchase it with an eligible motherboard, per &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15192259-amd-ryzen-7-5800x-3-8-ghz-eight-core-am4-processor-360-free-store-pickup?src=frontpage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Crime-tracking app Citizen now includes a premium-priced safety help line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshots from Citizen Protect" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XR89B6eCqS-HSuZ2MBwgp6Amjqk=/255x0:2145x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671428/01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Citizen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="efp5YR"&gt;The crime-tracking app Citizen is now launching its own emergency response service, promising access to agents who can call 911 or keep tabs on a potentially dangerous situation. Protect, which costs $19.99 per month, builds on a beta program that launched earlier this year. It’s part of a larger — and sometimes controversial — expansion effort at the startup, which has built a crime-mapping system into a live broadcasting platform while experimenting with private security services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgPWOm"&gt;Citizen Protect is essentially a private safety help line that draws on smartphone features like location tracking. When subscribers open the Citizen app, they can hit a button to call a “Protect Agent” via video, audio, or text. Agents are supposed to talk subscribers through unsafe scenarios and help callers navigate to a safe public place if necessary. They can dial 911 or a designated emergency contact and provide location information from the caller’s phone. And they can create a public Citizen incident with the subscriber’s consent, alerting nearby Citizen users to what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QpyBq5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users can call a “Protect Agent” via video, audio, or text&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="khzdy2"&gt;On iOS, subscribers can turn on an automated “Protect Mode” as well. This sets the app to listen for a “distress signal” such as a scream — after which it will ask if the user wants to call an agent, then connect to one automatically if there’s no answer. Users can also shake their phones rapidly to connect with an agent. (Citizen says it will add these options to Android soon.) If users are in trouble but can’t directly ask for help, agents can still listen in via a phone’s microphone and call 911 if they deem it necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV5d5M"&gt;Citizen’s main service is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/style/citizen-neighborhood-crime-app.html"&gt;crime-tracking app&lt;/a&gt; that posts reports of nearby safety incidents based on user tips, police scanner data, and other sources. It’s moved into live video as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595648/citizen-app-crime-scene-paid-live-streamer-nyc-la-emergencies"&gt;recruiting paid streamers&lt;/a&gt; to cover reports of missing children, house fires, and crime scenes. In a statement, Citizen CEO Andrew Frame said Protect marks an evolution from “a one-way system” for broadcasting safety alerts to “a two-way system where users can request help from Citizen.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Citizen Protect screenshots" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJMByBbu8IMRzR-pW1dwlKpJoEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758167/04.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="17d4Y0"&gt;Citizen may have an incentive to publicize calls in a way that 911 operators don’t. Earlier this year the company launched OnAir, a live broadcast system that blends crime tracking with local reporting. In a high-profile misfire, Citizen OnAir streamers urged users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles"&gt;hunt down an innocent man&lt;/a&gt; falsely suspected of arson. That said, publicity could be helpful to some subscribers: Citizen promotes its ability to spread the word about lost people and pets, for instance, crediting the app with 20 rescues since its 2017 launch. And it promises agents will never create a Citizen alert without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GaqOW"&gt;Citizen has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447756/citizen-app-private-security-securitas-los-angeles-professional"&gt;tested patrol cars rented from private security outfits&lt;/a&gt;, but at least so far, Protect isn’t a substitute for police or 911. Its agents don’t dispatch special private forces, and they’re purely remote operators. Some features also don’t seem like a huge upgrade to existing smartphone options. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208076"&gt;Emergency SOS&lt;/a&gt; can discreetly call 911 and share location data alongside an emergency call, and it includes extra features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936113/apple-watch-emergency-sos-fall-detection-set-up-how-to"&gt;automatic fall detection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiXooR"&gt;In a call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Citizen promoted Protect for risky situations that aren’t yet 911-worthy emergencies. The company claims agents’ presence has helped deescalate disputes during the beta, offering examples like someone having a heated argument with a volatile roommate. It says some Black beta users have asked agents to watch if they’re stopped by law enforcement, building on Citizen’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/12/21284113/police-protests-surveillance-instagram-washington-dc"&gt;capabilities for monitoring police during protests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag3K1I"&gt;Protect’s value hinges on its promise of quick and competent support across the roughly 60 US cities where it operates. Citizen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Protect operators are hired directly, not subcontracted through another security service, and that its staff has comfortably supported around 100,000 beta users. It declined to disclose how many agents it employs, and it hasn’t offered detail on how often most Protect beta users call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="X158oX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Citizen promotes Protect for risky situations that aren’t yet 911 emergencies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l5qSlX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90639153/citizen-public-safety-surveillance"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; article questioned&lt;/a&gt; the capabilities of Protect agents during the beta, noting that the qualifications in a job listing were “minimal.” Conversely, Citizen describes its agents as “highly trained safety experts” who sometimes have experience as social workers, police dispatchers, and emergency responders. Among other things, it says the employees complete a four-week Public Safety Telecommunicator certification course that includes training on bias and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pnszu4"&gt;Critics have accused Citizen of &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/it-creates-a-culture-of-fear-how-crime-tracking-apps-incite-unnecessary-panic/"&gt;inciting fear and paranoia&lt;/a&gt; so it can sell peace of mind through services like Protect. One former employee &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; that&lt;/a&gt; “the whole idea behind Protect is that you could convince people to pay for the product once you’ve gotten them to the highest point of anxiety you can possibly get them to.” Citizen has denied the claim, saying that it surfaces only “relevant, real-time information” about people’s surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTCgH3"&gt;But Protect could offer some support for people experiencing persistent health issues or threats like stalking. Unlike a 911 call, a Protect call doesn’t directly prompt a police dispatch that could turn violent. And there’s no sharing system that could amplify noncredible or bias-fueled accusations the way a social network might, so an agent could theoretically defuse situations without getting anyone else involved. While Protect is described as an app feature, its value will probably depend on the humans Citizen can hire — and how Citizen tells them to respond to users’ calls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sri Lanka’s cannabis-seekers are gathering on Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOsK2LU2-ISVzUr_o8mfU-AJIQs=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671411/VRG_4679_SriLanka_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook groups have become a gray market for the country’s weed dealers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BwqatQ"&gt;One weekend about a year ago in Balangoda, a misty mountain town outside Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, Sanjana was supposed to meet a dealer she found on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/923602878094040"&gt;Thriloka Wijaya Pathra&lt;/a&gt;, a Facebook group for cannabis users in Sri Lanka. Like many strangers who had connected over Facebook, Sanjana had decided to buy a few joints of ganja (a local word for weed). Then a family emergency happened and Sanjana couldn’t make it. A few days later, another group member told Sanjana that police caught her dealer. Perhaps he was released after a fine. Perhaps he went behind the bars. Sanjana didn’t hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObsZLX"&gt;“The only thing I know is that this stuff is illegal in Sri Lanka and it can get you in trouble,” Sanjana, now an 18-year-old, recalled to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, while waiting for another dealer to bring ganja grown domestically, 4.5 hours north of Colombo. “I was at my boyfriend’s place in Balangoda,” Sanjana said, chuckling. “If it’s two to three joints, I’ve heard they release you after a $30 fine. Plus my boyfriend works in the police. He could’ve got me out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOfTEq"&gt;Cannabis has a complicated history in the island nation. While native medicinal practitioners used cannabis to treat illnesses in the past, a law introduced in 1935 under British colonial rule criminalized cannabis. Though a 1967 government act permitted registered Ayurvedic doctors to use cannabis for medicinal purposes, today Sri Lanka &lt;a href="https://sensiseeds.com/en/blog/countries/cannabis-in-sri-lanka-laws-use-history/"&gt;still considers&lt;/a&gt; cannabis to be a “dangerous drug,” and recreational use can result in fines and years of prison time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RmFph9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People feel that Facebook is safer than real life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i0qzfS"&gt;Despite these laws, cannabis is the &lt;a href="https://www.unafei.or.jp/publications/pdf/RS_No107/No107_15_IP_SriLanka.pdf"&gt;most-used illicit drug in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, with an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.unodc.org/southasia/frontpage/2009/October/interview-with-mr.-mendes.html"&gt;600,000 users&lt;/a&gt;; natural scientist Wasantha Sena Weliange believes that number is much higher. In recent years, cannabis has become extremely popular with Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3nJPo"&gt;Buwanka, 25, is an Instagram influencer in Colombo who despised cannabis as a schoolkid. The anti-cannabis rhetoric, Buwanka said, comes from his parents’ generation, who believed cannabis was harmful. “Because that’s what everyone thought in the 1960s and 1970s. My parents fed me the same mentality. So as a teen, I was the first to report my classmates if they smoked ganja,” said Buwanka, who only wanted to reveal his first name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imALsD"&gt;But things changed when he left for college in Adelaide, Australia. Thousands of miles away from his Sri Lankan home, he began to feel lonely. When his roommate gave him ganja, he gave it a try. “I became happier. I started going out and joining all the cool events in the city.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ujf54"&gt;Buwanka now thinks that people refuse cannabis not because they dislike it, but because it’s tied to social stigma. “We constantly believe ganja is bad and if someone smokes ganja, they are addicts who have no use for society.” But Facebook communities, he said, are working toward changing this stereotype by gathering like-minded people into one place and creating a forum for discussion. “People feel that Facebook is safer than real life. They are more confident in sharing what they want on social media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNpxsY"&gt;When Sanjana joined Thriloka Wijaya Pathra two years ago, there were only a few thousand members — now there are over 177,000. The group, which takes its name from the Sanskrit for cannabis, provides a platform for cannabis users to get together and share information: different uses of cannabis, medicinal qualities, details on how to roll a joint, etc. Members post pictures of their cannabis plants in tiny pots grown in secret inside their houses. And of course there are memes and TikTok videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hp6i3c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dinesh considers himself “just a pawn” in a large drug supply chain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hsZx2e"&gt;Anil, 19, smokes weed in Ja-Ela, a town just a few miles north of Colombo. He started smoking at 15 with his rugby teammates. “Every stoner grows a ganja plant, or at least we try,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, recalling his unsuccessful attempts to grow cannabis in a clay pot. “Because this shit is hard to find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtpXnY"&gt;In Sri Lanka, police often &lt;a href="http://www.colombopage.com/archive_19A/Feb26_1551154235CH.php"&gt;raid cannabis plantations&lt;/a&gt;, destroy them, and put traditional growers behind bars. This leads to a shortage of fresh, local weed. Smokers, Anil said, have found a solution: Kerala ganja — commonly known as &lt;em&gt;KG&lt;/em&gt; — smuggled from South India to Sri Lanka. Anil meets KG users in a place he calls “smokers den” in Colombo, a sort of cannabis retreat run by a 30-year-old in his private apartment where smokers can meet, chat, dance, and party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9uaJE"&gt;Although local distributors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gopiharan/status/1005353974235463680?lang=en"&gt;spray poisonous ingredients&lt;/a&gt; like formaldehyde and domestic pest killers like Mortein on these products, making commonly available KG a &lt;a href="https://www.sundayobserver.lk/2019/09/08/health/medi-snippets-kerala-ganja-users-are-risk-heart-failure-stroke"&gt;harmful narcotic&lt;/a&gt;, Anil boasts that he smokes “pure KG” — cannabis without added chemicals — and can identify the “real stuff” when he sees it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lcdF8"&gt;“There’s nothing like pure KG now. All KG is a shit mix of chemicals,” said Dinesh, 28, who is a drug dealer and a tuk-tuk driver in the Colombo suburb of Mattakkuliya. Like Dinesh, many weed distributors in Sri Lanka are tuk-tuk drivers who sell low-quality, cheap KG. Dinesh, who started dealing drugs when he was 16, soon after he dropped out of school, considers himself “just a pawn” in a large drug supply chain. He receives goods from several others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JPcv68"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s cheap. It’s everywhere.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fzIZ9h"&gt;While his customers come from all walks of life, Dinesh said that most of them are teens. Most young users, he said, don’t come face to face; they send someone older to buy ganja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGgGG"&gt;His prices start at $2 for a small packet of KG, enough for a joint. “This cheap stuff has lots of chemicals. The more chemicals, the more you feel,” said Dinesh. “It’s a different kind of high. It’s the sudden thrill that young boys, and occasionally girls, love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KZogY"&gt;Dinesh agrees that teens are aware of the harmful substances in chemically treated KG. “But it’s what most people can afford,” he said. “Rich kids come to me and buy &lt;a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Hashish_vs_Marijuana"&gt;hash&lt;/a&gt; and kush [imported drugs with higher levels of THC].” Dinesh sells a gram of kush for about 7,000 LKR ($40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80MSef"&gt;Janith, a 19-year-old in Colombo who goes to a paid private school, said his friends also use expensive edibles, like gummies from Canada that go for $100. Janith and his mates consider KG a “bad trip” they avoid. But young smokers often don’t have an idea about what is good or not, so they search on Reddit or join Facebook groups to find information and connect with fellow smokers, Janith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFS30h"&gt;Although a March &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/923602878094040/posts/1171718439949148"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; on the Thriloka Wijaya Pathra group asks members to not talk about KG, a June post from a member asks his fellow smokers what they prefer, KG or local ganja. Most users wrote KG. A handful of them said they use KG since local ganja is hard to find. Sanjana agreed. “It’s cheap. It’s everywhere.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qT4im9"&gt;Sanjana, who has smoked KG, believes that Facebook groups like Thriloka Wijaya Pathra play a key role in educating smokers. When Sanjana initially joined, she saw a series of Facebook posts about cannabis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go9UsE"&gt;“Maybe there are bad sides to cannabis, but why would I stop something if it makes me feel good?” said Sanjana, “In the past, some people commented against using cannabis. But now people get correct information and see there’s no harm. It’s all thanks to these groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P63ayF"&gt;Gen Z aren’t the only ones using social media to talk about cannabis. When Buwanka posted an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG5IzyZhA_9/"&gt;IGTV video&lt;/a&gt; about cannabis and why it should be legalized in Sri Lanka about eight months ago, it caught attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYQZ0R"&gt;But Buwanka’s video didn’t go viral on Instagram. It was when cannabis community groups on Facebook shared it that he received a roaring response. There were 138,000 views on popular Facebook pages like Weedboy. Comments poured in. People loved Buwanka’s video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7k78VF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Only a handful of urban people use Instagram, but everyone’s on Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gKGY1Y"&gt;Buwanka said it was because he spoke in a local language, Sinhala. “Most cannabis users don’t speak English. When you go online, you can read about cannabis, but it’s all in English. I needed to do something that everyone could understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A2tfQ"&gt;“Only a handful of urban people use Instagram, but everyone’s on Facebook,” said Buwanka. “That’s why it went viral on Facebook.” While over &lt;a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-sri_lanka/2020/01"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lankans have a Facebook account, only &lt;a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/instagram-users-in-sri_lanka/2020/01"&gt;4.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lankans are on Instagram. Most Facebook users are young. Over a third of them are under 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q6MnB"&gt;Of course, safe use of cannabis isn’t the only thing they talk about. While these Facebook groups don’t allow users to sell cannabis or share details about dealers in public, Buwanka said that Facebook users still talk about these things. “Especially during lockdowns, people would come to these groups and comment, ‘I’m from Gampola and we’ve run dry over here.’ Or, ‘My tuk-tuk dealer has tested positive for COVID. Can someone send me some ganja?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFFLP3"&gt;These groups have connected the cannabis community with one another, giving smokers a chance to share details outside the groups. Buwanka said that members chat on Messenger and share supplier details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UViayh"&gt;“You make friends in these groups, but it’s hard to send ganja to some other place because it’s risky. I know people put it in perfume bottles and send it via delivery guys,” said Sanjana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWhvCY"&gt;During holidays, Sanjana smokes a few joints with her 17-year-old cousin; they post about cannabis on Thriloka Wijaya Pathra and share photos. “Because our society expects girls to be cultural, people think that cannabis is only for boys and girls can’t use it,” said Sanjana. “That’s bullshit. Everyone can use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJrYBW"&gt;Sanjana thinks that Facebook helps change how people think. “When I first posted, people wrote negative things. Boys thought, ‘Girls can’t use ganja.’ But now a lot of members support the idea of girls smoking,” said Sanjana, who responded to negative comments with a rolling-eyes emoji and wrote, “Girls need to feel good, just like you do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oGw1r8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you can just walk into a shop and buy fresh ganja at affordable prices, why would you choose harmful stuff?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NZln4"&gt;While young smokers are finding community on Facebook, 56-year-old natural scientist Wasantha Sena Weliange, who is &lt;a href="https://www.themorning.lk/high-time-for-cannabis-legalisation/"&gt;fighting to legalize&lt;/a&gt; cannabis in Sri Lanka, runs his own &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/448451116534844"&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; to support generational cannabis farmers. Weliange, who wrote a Sinhala-language book about cannabis, is now building a hemp museum and a cannabis village in Thanamalvila in the southeast of the country. “On Facebook, we are trying to establish knowledge and influence young people to join the fight to legalize cannabis,” Weliange said. “We get calls from a lot of young people. They are happy to see this. They are curious. Some of them ask me, ‘Can I mix ganja with yogurt?’ or ‘What can we make from them?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axtpw4"&gt;Weliange believes that legalizing cannabis will not only help farmers, but also prevent young people from using chemically processed KG and other harmful substances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oJK6E"&gt;This also resonated with Buwanka. “If you can just walk into a shop and buy fresh ganja at affordable prices, why would you choose harmful stuff?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HN44UP"&gt;While the government has discussed &lt;a href="http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2020/09/13/news-features/legalising-and-exporting-cannabis-cards"&gt;planting cannabis for export purposes&lt;/a&gt;, Sri Lanka’s &lt;a href="https://www.ucanews.com/news/sri-lankan-religious-leaders-oppose-cannabis-cultivation/89629"&gt;dominant Buddhist clergy&lt;/a&gt; are against decriminalizing cannabis for everyday use. But both Gen Z and older generations are still using it, and frequenting Facebook to meet each other. “If it wasn’t for social media, I don’t think we can come together around a tree and talk about cannabis,” Buwanka said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KbEZM"&gt;Meanwhile, Anil still believes he can identify good KG, while Janith says friends make brownies when they get together. Dinesh knows his job is risky, as police can raid him, but he’s happy being a dealer as long as it brings him money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4yGj66"&gt;“If they legalize it, I will be the first to plant ganja in my garden,” said Sanjana, who’s planning to study a Japanese-language course in order to go work in Japan with her cousin. “But the only problem is that cannabis is illegal in Japan. I’ve heard you can’t get around it like we do here.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Boeing launch its astronaut capsule to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASA/Kim Shiflett" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hDIeWCBP92CG4HI8VoLtYlc4PN4=/0x116:1365x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671303/51347154310_cb53a69a6b_k.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Boeing’s Starliner capsule sits atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket | NASA/Kim Shiflett&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MNIyb"&gt;Boeing is set to launch its Starliner astronaut capsule to the International Space Station (ISS) as soon as Wednesday, more than a year and a half after its first orbital Starliner test failed to reach the station and returned home earlier than planned. The mission is a test, and there won’t be any humans on board. Originally slated to launch on July 30th, Boeing and NASA have delayed the launch date twice so far, the first delay due to a mishap at the International Space Station and the second due to an issue that Boeing has yet to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYAajT"&gt;If all goes well, it’ll mark a crucial step toward Boeing and NASA’s goal to use Starliner for routine astronaut missions, and a key chance to salvage the aerospace giant’s reputation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;after years of setbacks and controversies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVlemU"&gt;The test mission, called Orbital Flight Test 2, will launch from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station using an Atlas-V rocket built by United Launch Alliance. Starliner, sitting on top of the rocket, will do what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/2/18244499/spacex-crew-dragon-launch-first-capsule-iss-nasa-passenger-flight"&gt;Boeing’s rival SpaceX did with its Crew Dragon capsule in early 2019&lt;/a&gt; — go to space, dock to the ISS, remain there for 10 days, then return back to Earth. Both companies have developed their capsules under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, with Boeing’s Starliner contract at $4.5 billion and SpaceX’s at $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVS5n1"&gt;Starliner, a seven-seated astronaut pod shaped like a flat acorn, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/22/21033757/boeing-cst-100-starliner-landing-success-oft-rough-flight"&gt;suffered a series of software glitches&lt;/a&gt; during its 2019 test flight, forcing Boeing to skip its space station docking and bring it home early just two days after launching to space. In the next 18 months, Boeing worked to settle 80 different concerns that sprang from lengthy technical investigations led by company employees and independent experts at NASA. Those 80 recommendations have been implemented, Boeing’s Starliner chief John Vollmer told reporters on Tuesday, and Starliner is ready to fly again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w1Dg8e"&gt;What time is the launch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GM2H0z"&gt;Liftoff could be Wednesday at 1PM ET, the next launch opportunity after Tuesday’s delay. That delay, tweeted by Boeing Tuesday morning roughly three hours before a planned 1:20PM liftoff, was caused by a technical issue with Starliner, but it’s unclear how severe that issue is and the company has yet to provide more details on the matter. Tory Bruno, the CEO of ULA (the company launching Starliner to space), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1422565560089468933?s=20"&gt;said mission teams will try to launch tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wKIp7e"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're confirming today's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starliner?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Starliner&lt;/a&gt; Orbital Flight Test-2 launch is scrubbed. More details soon.&lt;/p&gt;— Boeing Space (@BoeingSpace) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BoeingSpace/status/1422564382320496640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pmpQrb"&gt;Forecasts from the Air Force predicted only a 50 percent chance of favorable launch weather — odds that usually keep mission teams optimistic for a liftoff. Boeing and NASA postponed the mission from last Friday after a new Russian science module that docked the day before Starliner’s planned launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601752/russia-nauka-module-software-glitch-iss-space-station-nasa"&gt;started uncontrollably firing its thrusters and pushed the entire space station out of position&lt;/a&gt;. NASA’s ISS team needed time to make sure everything on the space station was back to normal before welcoming a new spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEY2ox"&gt;Whenever Starliner launches, it’ll try docking to the International Space Station roughly 24 hours later to begin its ten-day stay. NASA astronauts already on board the station — Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur, Mark Vande Hei — will run tests inside the capsule before it undocks roughly 10 days later. The exact time Starliner undocks to begin its trek home depends on weather forecasts over New Mexico, where the capsule will return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HIzTDJ"&gt;How to watch Starliner’s mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Swqpbf"&gt;Like all of its launches, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/live/"&gt;NASA plans to stream Starliner’s launch on a YouTube feed&lt;/a&gt;, with live coverage starting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;roughly an hour before liftoff. NASA’s live coverage of Starliner’s ISS docking begins the following day a few hours beforehand, and will also be viewable on the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;main live YouTube feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liAbuM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Tuesday, 11:00AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added update from Boeing that Starliner’s Tuesday launch has been postponed to Wednesday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon and Best Buy’s latest Fire TVs have a sleeker design and better HDR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFYqK_rdb5GVsalYEwVZlNPwJS8=/34x0:2485x1634/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69671298/B823E2AA_EE2D_4D51_9125_88DEF71EF1B4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ddycRY"&gt;Amazon and Best Buy are continuing on with their TV partnership that started three years ago. Today, the companies announced new Insignia and Toshiba TVs that run Amazon’s Fire TV software. The latest F50 series improves on previous “Fire TV Edition” sets — Amazon is just calling them “Fire TVs” now — with expanded quantum dot HDR color for a more vivid picture. The new models also feature slimmer bezels, DTS Virtual-X audio from the built-in speakers, and continue to support Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Boc3m"&gt;Pricing will start at $599.99 for a 50-inch model, and the F50 series tops out at 70 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5yK0L"&gt;Between different models and screen sizes (ranging from 24 inches to 75 inches) sold in the US and Canada, there are now over 80 Insignia and Toshiba Fire TVs available. Both are Best Buy’s house brands, and customers can order any of the TVs on Amazon’s website for in-store pickup at their nearest Best Buy store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuOPgs"&gt;When they ship later this summer, the latest TVs will come preloaded with Amazon’s revamped, content-focused Fire TV software experience. The included remote will also support Alexa voice commands. You’ve still got to press and hold the Alexa button to make voice requests; Amazon and Best Buy continue to refrain from putting always-listening mics in these TVs, which seems like the right decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WaDX2"&gt;These are still being positioned as inexpensive TVs that are centered around &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; entertainment; if you’re looking for the best set for showcasing your new Xbox Series X or PS5, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere. While Amazon has released higher-end Fire TV sets in other countries (like an OLED from Grundig in Germany), so far there’s nothing in its US lineup that can go toe to toe with TCL’s flagship Roku TVs in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
