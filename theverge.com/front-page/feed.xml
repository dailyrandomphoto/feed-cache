    <title>The first full trailer for Chloé Zhao’s Eternals promises an epoch-spanning epic from Marvel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/boeVYkeypbaP7hyrVSEMWpd4pJg=/431x0:1997x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333726/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_9.03.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvzQKp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417115/marvel-eternals-chloe-zhao-oscar-winner-teaser-footage-black-panther-captain-marvel-sequels"&gt;After a brief teaser&lt;/a&gt; earlier in May, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WVDKZJkGlY"&gt;Marvel has finally revealed a full-length trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, set to hit theaters on November 5th. In addition to being the latest entry in the MCU, &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is the first film from Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao since winning Best Picture and Best Director wins for &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H0Akx"&gt;The trailer doesn’t actually do much to showcase the plot of what &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; will be about, instead focusing on the civilization-spanning scope of the superhero team and its members throughout human history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZmyNM"&gt;“We have watched and guided. We have helped them progress and seen them accomplish wonders,” Salma Hayek’s Ajak muses, as we see the Eternals help humanity raise crops, establish cities, and war throughout the ages. “Throughout the years, we have never interfered — until now.” As to what threat is causing the Eternals to join together and intervene in the course of human events? That will have to wait until future trailers (or the actual film itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80Ql6o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; is notable for several reasons beyond its plot. The cast — led by Gemma Chan (Sersi), with Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, and Don Lee, as well as &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; expats Richard Madden and Kit Harington — is easily the most diverse lineup of actors in any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films to date. (Albeit, it’s a milestone that took over a decade and nearly two-dozen films to reach.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/exIWYbbafM0lThFnCycTSoBVJ38=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535783/Eternals_Teaser_1_Sheet_v10_Lg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s7cw3M"&gt;It’s also a big swing on Marvel’s part in terms of getting audiences on board with a new ensemble cast based on a less popular property. The Eternals — a group of immortal heroes who have existed alongside human civilization for centuries, often mistaken for the gods of human mythology — aren’t exactly household names, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2021/1/6/22216945/eternals-1-review-2021"&gt;even with a much-hyped new run of comics&lt;/a&gt; from superstar writer Kieron Gillen currently in print. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="no6f9B"&gt;It’s a similar kind of gamble that the company has taken in the past on other lesser-known teams, like &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; — now one of Marvel’s most beloved group of characters. But these experiments have also gone south fast: just ask Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Inhumans&lt;/em&gt;, which was passed off from feature-length film down to the now-defunct Marvel Television studios to turn into a series instead, which was widely panned and then canceled after a single season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfGCu3"&gt;With a cast full of Hollywood A-listers and one of the most exciting directors around working on the project, it seems unlikely that &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; will meet &lt;em&gt;Inhumans&lt;/em&gt;’ fate — but we’ll have to wait until November to find out for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How futuristic floating wind turbines might ride the waves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Block Island wind farm as seen from Montauk Point, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7m-I9iMyZmOp6TfB1CJLY2O9XgQ=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333620/1317979252.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UvtVxP"&gt;GE shared some new details today of a concept that might advance the development of futuristic floating wind farms. Floating turbines are engineering marvels — or nightmares, depending on how you see it — that could make massive swathes of deep ocean available to offshore wind development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6qbXqt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Make massive swathes of deep ocean available to offshore wind &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FIoNGR"&gt;While they hold a lot of potential, the floating behemoths have so far been too costly to deploy at commercial scale. And because they’re floating, they also face a barrage of technical challenges&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that turbines fixed to the seabed don’t have to weather. GE hopes to solve some of those problems through advanced turbine controls that it’s developing alongside consulting firm Glosten. They’re pairing this with their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/business/GE-wind-turbine.html#:~:text=General%20Electric's%20prototype%20for%20a,is%20the%20largest%20ever%20built.&amp;amp;text=The%20prototype%20is%20the%20first,largest%20already%20in%20commercial%20service."&gt;largest turbine model&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty and Washington Monument combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JIkGZ"&gt;GE received a &lt;a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/control-co-design-and-co-optimization-lightweight-12-mw-wind-turbine-actuated"&gt;$3 million award&lt;/a&gt; from the US Department of Energy to support the two-year project, which started last year. If the company can prove, through modeling and simulations, that its design will work, then it might move forward with its partners on the project to build a prototype. Today, they’re revealing some details of their design during an “&lt;a href="https://www.arpae-summit.com/"&gt;Energy Innovation Summit&lt;/a&gt;” hosted by the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwuxWs"&gt;Designing a turbine that can float gracefully on the water is like “putting a bus on a tall pole, making it float and then stabilizing it while it interacts with wind and waves,” according to Rogier Blom, GE’s principal investigator for the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kW37e1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Putting a bus on a tall pole, making it float”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Koen7r"&gt;The turbines themselves are essentially the same as other turbines fixed to the seafloor. The big differences are the design of the platform holding it up and the controls used to maneuver them on rough open ocean. GE is working to couple the design of an existing 12MW turbine and platform with automated controls so that they can work together in a more streamlined way. The controls, built-in sensors and computers, improve how the turbine responds to wind and waves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHVRKC"&gt;If these controls are successful, the floating turbine could automatically adjust itself to catch strong gales without tipping over. That would ultimately maximize their power output, making them more profitable. Floating turbines without more advanced controls need to be bulkier so that they can stand up to surf. But with a smarter design, GE aims to reduce the platform’s mass by more than a third compared to other designs for floating turbines — which would ultimately cut down on costs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The design for GE’s floating wind turbine concept" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gkrs67DGJgObH5qAXhvesuGyJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531748/ARPA_E_Summit_ATLANTIS_project_image__1_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new design for GE’s floating wind turbine concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ux2gbE"&gt;GE is using a so-called “tension-leg platform” that’s anchored to the seabed with adjustable “tendons.” Its new technology would be able to sense gusts of wind and swells in the ocean and, in real time, adjust the length of the tendons accordingly so that the platform can smoothly ride the waves. Blom describes the process as “see, think, do.” The control system’s sensors, for example, detect a change in wind speed, determine how that change affects the turbine, and then make adjustments to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0v7ww"&gt;Tension-leg platforms are “innovative” and one of the most stable platform designs, according to Walt Musial, a principal engineer who leads offshore wind research at &lt;a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2020/floating-offshore-wind-rises.html"&gt;the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s also very difficult to install, and a prototype hasn’t even been demonstrated yet with a full-scale offshore wind turbine on top (although similar technology has been used for offshore oil production), according to Musial. Then again, everything about floating wind farms is still pretty novel. There are only a handful of floating wind turbines operating in the world and no commercial-scale wind farms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wi0JFD"&gt;That could soon change. Musial forecasts the first commercial-scale project to come online, probably in Asia, in just a few years. Developing advanced controls, as GE is attempting, plays a big role in making that happen, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mZuhI2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They can move far away enough from shore to potentially satisfy coastal residents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TWVGQN"&gt;“We are excited about this project because this could be a common enabling technology to tap into [a majority] of offshore wind resources,“ says Blom. Offshore wind designs are currently limited to waters shallower than 60 meters deep. That puts 60 percent of US offshore wind resources out of reach of fixed offshore turbines. But those resources could be developed with floating farms, &lt;a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2020/floating-offshore-wind-rises.html"&gt;according to NREL&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWHJA2"&gt;There are other advantages to &lt;a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/will-floating-turbines-usher-in-a-new-wave-of-offshore-wind"&gt;floating wind farms&lt;/a&gt;. They can move far away enough from shore to potentially satisfy coastal residents concerned about how turbines might affect fishing, birds, or seaside views. They also don’t disturb the seabed — except for anchors used to moor the platform. That solves yet another problem that’s stymied offshore wind development: a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296979/us-offshore-ships-wind-boom-installation-vessels"&gt;shortage of specialized ships&lt;/a&gt; needed to install turbine foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tv6GGH"&gt;There’s been skepticism in the past about whether floating turbines can develop fast enough and bring costs down to a point where they can really take off. They’re also competing with their seafloor-fixed counterparts that are quickly advancing into deeper and deeper waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0fWWb"&gt;“We shouldn’t underestimate the creativity of the fixed offshore wind industry, because they are also pushing the boundary,” says Po Wen Cheng, head of wind energy at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Aircraft Design. When he started in offshore wind research some 20 years ago, people didn’t think traditional turbines could be installed in waters deeper than 20 meters. They’ve since smashed that limit. But in a race to develop enough renewable energy to stave off the climate crisis, there may be enough room yet for both floating and fixed designs to take to the seas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon is offering customers free Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass for up to a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NbGxCieqwryDJ_uVp_c1udB_CF0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333468/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLwTrr"&gt;Verizon has a new deal for new and existing unlimited plan subscribers starting May 25th: up to a year of &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/gaming/apple-arcade/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/gaming/google-play/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt;, free of charge. Specifically, customers who pay for the Play More Unlimited and Get More Unlimited plans get 12 months of either app subscription service for free, while all other unlimited plans get six months. It’s worth noting that both free options are longer than the ones Apple or Google offer themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pccJT7"&gt;The $80 per month Play More plan or $90 per month Get More plan (that’s the price for a single line) also come with other benefits to sweeten the deal. Play More comes with an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up to 15GB of 5G data, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371902/verizon-unlimited-plans-free-disney-plus-espn-hulu-bundle"&gt;the Disney Bundle&lt;/a&gt; (Hulu, Disney Plus, ESPN Plus), six months of Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MdnOH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not quite unlimited, but the add-ons are nice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E7CmXf"&gt;Meanwhile, Get More offers an “unlimited” mobile hotspot with up 30GB of 5G data, the Disney Bundle, a continuous subscription to Apple Music, and 12 months of Discovery Plus. Verizon frequently offers all sorts of other promotions so you can check &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/plans/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D39986104348088388961888296802413619485%7CMCAID%3D304EA1F622850B1E-40001414C26A22B2%7CMCORGID%3D843F02BE53271A1A0A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1621640023&amp;amp;mboxSession=4b9bd75675694d1c8939eaadd9212408" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; for the most up-to-date deals. (Each plan only guarantees 50GB of 5G/4G data at most, so none of them are technically “unlimited.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGn63Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280589/apple-arcade-gaming-subscription-release-date-pricing-features"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; are similar conceptually — pay monthly for access to a selection of the best apps from a platform without in-app purchases — but differ meaningfully in what they actually offer. Apple Arcade is focused on games and by far has some of the most interesting exclusives. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21026128/apple-arcade-best-games-iphone-ipad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grindstone &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Card of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were early favorites, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;the recent addition of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a JRPG from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, is also well worth subscribing for, even if you have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxAtTn"&gt;Play Pass is a bit more holistic as an offering, but might be worth it if you’re new to Android. Google includes popular games &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; apps in the service, spanning everything from a farming sim like &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;(normally $4.99) to a utility app like AccuWeather (free, but includes in-app purchases). It also offers a larger selection than Apple Arcade, with &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/31/google-play-pass-800/#:~:text=Google%20Play%20Pass%20now%20offers%20more%20than%20800%20Android%20apps%20and%20games&amp;amp;text=Google%20introduced%20Play%20Pass%20in,of%20the%20%244.99%20monthly%20membership."&gt;now over 800 apps and games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a0jgO"&gt;Neither Apple Arcade nor Google Play Pass are particularly expensive on their own at $4.99 per month each, but their free trials also aren’t as long as what Verizon is offering. Apple will toss in three months of Arcade for free if you purchase a new Apple device, but otherwise offers a one-month free trial. Google also only offers a one-month free trial for Play Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk9jdR"&gt;If you’re interested in Verizon’s deal, but want a better understanding of what’s available to you, check out our lists of the best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178231/apple-arcade-iphone-ipad-best-games-2020"&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22170029/best-play-pass-games-google-android-phone"&gt;Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SiriusXM is starting a TikTok music channel to appeal to the teens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtlyyUSgK7qxBVnFY1zm4y8T7EU=/78x0:1203x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333225/WF_788501_TikTokPlaylistsPromotionalCampaign_PR_Design_R3_BlogHeader_1280x750.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SiriusXM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9zHk0"&gt;SiriusXM wants to reach the youth, and starting today, it’s going to do so through the cultural cachet of TikTok. Sirius, which owns Pandora and the podcasting company Stitcher, announced a new partnership with the social video app today that’ll bring TikTok-popularized music to the satellite radio provider. TikTok Radio, a new music channel, will broadcast trending sounds through the SiriusXM app, browser, and connected devices. Sirius says tuning in should sound like swiping through TikTok’s “For You” page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnTSPF"&gt;It’s also using the partnership to launch a new Pandora series, called TikTok Tastemakers, that’ll involve popular TikTok creators, like Bella Poarch, hosting and curating playlists with their favorite songs alongside commentary. They’ll also promote the shows on TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loDhag"&gt;The partnership really seems to mutually benefit both companies. TikTok gets even more brand promotion, while Sirius now has something to market to teens. Right now, the company’s most prominent deal is with Howard Stern, someone many teens likely haven’t tuned in to hear. Offering a TikTok station might make selling them a satellite radio subscription slightly easier — or if nothing else, it’ll make driving around in their parents’ car more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metro Exodus on PC adds support for PS5 controller’s amazing adaptive triggers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DualSense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwrXsQ02WIelATSSt5VeSOv--dU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69333123/vpavic_4261_20201023_0028.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btApyF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; has become one of the first PC games to support the PS5 DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.metrothegame.com/news/patch-notes-pc-hotfix/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20added%20playstation%205%20dualsense%20controller%20support"&gt;a recent patch&lt;/a&gt;. Although many PC games already support the PS5 controller’s basic features, with Valve adding support for it to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591013/steam-input-api-ps5-dualsense-controller-support"&gt;Steam Input API last year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; now supports its advanced haptics, as well as its trigger features, which add extra resistance depending on what you’re doing in-game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwylhA"&gt;Videos posted by Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mrdomino_/status/1395878817441271810"&gt;@mrdomino_&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndyPlaytonic/status/1396112580511518729"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt;’s Andy Robinson&lt;/a&gt; show the feature in action, including showing the controller’s right trigger springing back with the recoil from various weapons. It’s nothing new compared to what we’ve seen from native PS5 games like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s great to see that same functionality replicated on PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W6Z4e9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PS5’s DualSense is now fully functional on PC, via Metro Exodus’ latest update. &lt;a href="https://t.co/97yVVYYIJy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/97yVVYYIJy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Robinson (@AndyPlaytonic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndyPlaytonic/status/1396112580511518729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="poJ3Zo"&gt;The patch means &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;’s full support for the controller has actually arrived on PC before the PS5 itself. The official PS5 version of the game isn’t due to release &lt;a href="https://www.metrothegame.com/news/metro-exodus-gen-9-coming-june-18/"&gt;until June 18th&lt;/a&gt;, when it will include full support for the controller’s haptic features alongside other features like ray tracing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8c5sH"&gt;There appears to be a couple of downsides for PC players, however, with &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metro-exodus-is-the-first-pc-game-to-utilise-ps5s-dualsense-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the advanced DualSense features only seem to work over a wired connection, and not wirelessly. &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/metro-exodus-dualsense-support-on-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; that the feature is exclusive to the Steam version of the game, and won’t work on purchases from the Epic Games Store or GOG. We’ve followed up with the game’s publisher for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQZbLl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fypg5K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford’s F-150 Lightning Pro is an electric pickup truck for businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1H4toINMEmiyi9YQDF88Ex6kbkk=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69332936/ford_f150_lightning_pro_0025.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G07eZ3"&gt;Ford has revealed a version of its new F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck aimed specifically at commercial customers. It’s called the F-150 Lightning Pro, and it starts at $39,974 for a version with an estimated 230 miles of range. Extended-range versions of the truck, which are expected to get 300 miles on a full battery, will start at $49,974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2DCql"&gt;Much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;the retail version of the electric F-150&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning Pro stands to win Ford a lot of business as long as the company executes well when the truck starts shipping in 2022. Fleets all over the country are already considering a switch to electric vehicles, either to get ahead of zero-emission guidelines at the state or federal level, or in an attempt to take advantage of what should be a lower total cost of ownership with electric vehicles. Ford claims the Lightning Pro could cut maintenance costs up to 40 percent over eight years and 100,000 miles of use compared to a 2.7L EcoBoost F-150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CeaYJF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The F-150 Lightning Pro is one of the only electric trucks aimed at commercial customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdpcPD"&gt;Multiple electric pickups are coming to market over the next year or two, including Tesla’s Cybertruck, the GMC Hummer EV, and the Rivian R1T. But almost none are geared specifically towards commercial fleets. One of the only examples is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;electric pickup truck being developed by Ohio startup Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;. That truck is supposed to go into production later this year, but it will start at around $52,000, and the company doesn’t have anywhere near the track record of an established automaker like Ford. Paired with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;the E-Transit van&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightning Pro gives Ford a potent one-two punch in the fight to electrify the commercial market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N987VR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10515280"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIwun5"&gt;There aren’t a lot of obvious differences between the Lightning Pro and the retail versions of the electric F-150 that Ford revealed last week. Like the retail version, it only comes in a four-door SuperCrew cab and 5.5-foot bed configuration. Buyers can choose to equip the Lightning Pro with the standard or extended range battery. The standard range version will have a max 7,700-pound towing capacity when equipped with the optional towing package, while the extended range can pull up to 10,000 pounds. Both versions use a dual-motor, all-wheel drive setup, with the standard range truck maxing out at an estimated 426 horsepower, while the extended range version can make around 563HP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1gzl6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford F-150 Lightning revealed: an electric truck for the masses","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uH8g3T"&gt;Both Lightning Pro trucks have onboard power available, which can run electric tools or other accessories, though buyers will have to pay more for extra outlets (including a 240 volt plug in the bed) and higher total output. The extended range option also comes with an 80-amp charging station that can pretty much help refill a truck’s battery overnight. All versions of the commercial truck come with the massive, water-resistant front trunk, which has 14.1 cubic feet of storage and its own set of electrical outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTLb9C"&gt;There is one big difference between the commercial and retail versions, though: the Lightning Pro will come with Ford’s commercial telematics software, which makes it easier for fleet owners to keep tabs on the location, charging status, or health of their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGkjC2"&gt;“It’s actually complimentary for customers, and it gives insights such as: what’s your odometer [at]? What warning lights and diagnostic trouble codes are there? And we’re going so far as to provide preventative and proactive prognostics,” says Alex Purdy, the head of connectivity on Ford’s business operations side. Purdy says Ford even offers a data service that works with any other third-party fleet telematics software businesses might already have up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="INPO5D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there are unique challenges”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qivY2n"&gt;Ford’s fleet software will also help operators tackle some of the more unconventional issues that might crop up as they switch to electric vehicles. For instance, some workers take their fleet vehicles home at night, fill up the gas tank on their own, and get reimbursed by their employer. Ford could help install home chargers for those workers, Purdy says, but the company has also written into the fleet software a way to let employers reimburse workers for the cost of at-home charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kq2Cs"&gt;“These are the kinds of things that make Ford different,” Purdy says. “We say that we know how people use their vehicles, and it feels like a hollow thing — it’s not actually hollow in this case at all, because there are unique challenges with making an electric vehicle, relevant, useful, and adoptable by commercial customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces bigger and smaller versions of its TV-like Smart Monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jdq5m-75yjM2IaLkZaAyndfnnac=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69332653/Smart_Monitor_PR_main1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLuDrb"&gt;Samsung’s Smart Monitor range is expanding. The company’s line of Tizen-powered smart computer displays &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-smart-monitor-lineup-worldwide-to-meet-growing-demand-of-do-it-all-displays"&gt;now includes&lt;/a&gt; a 43-inch 4K M7 model as well as a 24-inch 1080p M5, marking the biggest and smallest Smart Monitors to be made available to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egIBP3"&gt;Samsung introduced the Smart Monitor last year and describes it as a “do-it-all” display designed for both work and entertainment. The screens have built-in speakers and smart TV functionality through Samsung’s Tizen platform, meaning you can run video apps like Netflix directly on the device, as well as remote desktop access and productivity software like Office 365. The Smart Monitors have a remote control that works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Bixby, and there’s also wireless support for DeX, Samsung’s desktop-style environment that runs on Galaxy smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MCpkG2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s new Smart Monitor is like a TV for your PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21562738/samsung-smart-monitor-m5-m7-tizen-smart-tv-airplay-2-usb-c-release-date-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JATagp"&gt;The M7 series now includes 43-inch and 32-inch 4K options. The M5 series uses 1080p panels and comes in 24-inch, 27-inch, and 32-inch sizes. Samsung is also introducing a white version of the 27-inch and 32-inch M5 Smart Monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXji3o"&gt;Samsung hasn’t announced pricing yet for the new models, but for context, the 32-inch M7 was released at $399.99 while the 27-inch M5 was $229.99, so you can probably expect prices slightly above and below those two extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly hit with campaign by pro-Palestinian activists leaving 1-star app store ratings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Facebook, Inc. logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbcxN_kZXw2OFymE7bzIv9W9j2s=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69331565/1233004792.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iny5gO"&gt;A social media campaign by pro-Palestine activists has pushed down the ranking for Facebook’s app in Apple and Google’s app stores, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The activists are seeking to protest Facebook’s alleged censorship of Palestinian accounts on its platform, and are instructing people to leave Facebook’s app a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Skkyy__/status/1394588317900025858"&gt;one-star review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50MaNh"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;NBC New&lt;/em&gt;s, Facebook is treating the situation as a high-priority issue internally; one software engineer wrote in a post on an internal Facebook message board that “users are upset with our handling of the situation,” adding that the users “have started protesting by leaving 1-star reviews.”  Facebook has reached out to have the reviews removed, but so far, Apple has declined the request to remove the reviews. It’s not clear how or if Google responded to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRbdQF"&gt;The rating for Facebook’s iOS app on the App Store as of Sunday afternoon was 2.3 stars out of 5, with 1-star ratings far outpacing others. In the Google Play store the situation was similar; the Android Facebook app had a slightly higher 2.4 rating, with the majority of the reviews 1-star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvjnPi"&gt;Apple and Google did not immediately reply to requests for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4ezoe"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson said in a statement to&lt;em&gt; NBC&lt;/em&gt; that the company does not censor it users, but applies its policies equally “regardless of who is posting or their personal beliefs.” The spokesperson added that the company has a dedicated team that includes Arabic and Hebrew speakers who are “closely monitoring the situation on the ground, who are focused on making sure we’re removing harmful content, while addressing any enforcement errors as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrUndz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvXQbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Trese, Respect, Friends: The Reunion, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZoVXqVZmNzNXdvoIg5FHZ8sfhvs=/0x4:1358x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69331064/trese.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix in June | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUy0RgeggCQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=NetflixPhilippines" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Q7QtV"&gt;Still reeling from that shocking ending to last week’s &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt;? Me too! I have literally no idea what to expect in tonight’s episode or from next week’s finale. I can’t say the same for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead,&lt;/em&gt; a movie I really, really wanted to like but which felt really predictable. I found myself wishing the entire movie could have been as wild as its opening credits. &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; looks spectacular (except perhaps for the digitally-added Tig Notaro character), but could have done away with a few of the rag-tag mercenary characters and tightened things up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9QyiE"&gt;Here are this week’s trailers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R8iD42"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jUy0RgeggCQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lCpj1c"&gt;Trese&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pRJFzO"&gt;This long-awaited adaptation of the award-winning Filipino comic of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a woman who protects Manila from monsters that are based on Filipino mythology. In the English-language version, Shay Mitchell stars as Trese (Liza Soberano voices her in the Filipino-language version), along with Griffin Puatu, Manny Jacinto, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Dante Basco. &lt;em&gt;Trese &lt;/em&gt;comes to Netflix in the US on June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SJgHCs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTtxoz3OIlU?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3&amp;amp;start=3" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AI3VjS"&gt;Respect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sAtLhj"&gt;Jennifer Hudson stars in this biopic of the late Aretha Franklin and looks at the Queen of Soul’s early years as her star was on the rise. Naturally, it looks and sounds amazing. Forest Whitaker and Audra McDonald also star in &lt;em&gt;Respect&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ThBOqg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUpFzScK7P8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nGO7t9"&gt;The Mysterious Benedict Society &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7XYxKb"&gt;Four gifted orphans are recruited for a secret mission by Mr. Benedict to figure out what’s behind the mysterious LIVE Institute. This series is based on the book series by Trenton Lee Stewart, with Tony Hale starring as Benedict and his shady twin brother Mr. Curtain. Kristen Schaal also stars in &lt;em&gt;The Mysterious Benedict Society&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1073102/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; June 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3yY1jJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRXVQ77ehRQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YwwePC"&gt;Friends: The Reunion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cGv7eG"&gt;This trailer does not make me want to watch this reunion, but I was already leaning in that direction anyway.&lt;em&gt; Friends &lt;/em&gt;was, of course, wildly popular in its decade-long run on network television, and is a popular show on streaming as well. But I’m far from the first person to point out that this is not a show that aged well— in addition to the conspicuous lack of non-white characters throughout most of the show’s run, it had &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/04/fat-monica-friends-25-years-later/"&gt;ongoing fatphobic storylines&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.out.com/television/2019/10/01/heres-your-reminder-friends-was-really-really-homophobic"&gt;homophobic&lt;/a&gt; jokes and storylines as well (and also for the love of god, who cares whether you were “on a break,” Ross: you were in the wrong, the end). If the reunion would deal with and discuss some of &lt;em&gt;Friends’ &lt;/em&gt;more problematic elements, that might be interesting to watch. But the trailer makes no indication this will be the case;  rather it looks like it will include a lot of obsequious questions for the cast members from James Corden (?). The &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; reunion comes to &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=NewTrailers052421"&gt;HBO Max &lt;/a&gt;on May 27th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="MzKv8c"&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aDonQ"&gt;We got a glimpse of this movie with a teaser a couple of weeks ago but this is the first full-length trailer for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;, a post-apocalyptic fairytale based on a DC comic, with a hybrid deer-boy seeking answers about other hybrid children like him. I’m into it. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix June 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The needless drama of buying a PS5</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STXeel"&gt;Securing a PS5 is not easy, and it feels like it could be. With a combination of greed and incompetence, the stores selling PS5s in the United States have transformed the process into a weirdly dramatic affair where you’re forced to join Discords and follow overly exuberant guys on Twitter in the hopes that they’ll give you a heads-up on a PS5 “drop” — a store making a big shipment of PS5s available for purchase. These stores have turned every drop into an event, when really, buying a PS5 should be as easy as buying a pepper grinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAccHq"&gt;The other day, a package was sitting in the vestibule of my apartment building. I noticed my name on the label and mentally cataloged any recent purchases I may have made or packages someone mentioned sending. This didn’t match anything I was expecting, and I brought it upstairs, carefully opened the box... and found &lt;a href="https://mannkitchen.com/blogs/blog/what-makes-the-worlds-best-pepper-mill-the-worlds-best-pepper-mill"&gt;the pepper grinder I’d Kickstarted back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It began shipping months before, and my name had finally popped to the top of the queue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTS7ZT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have gotten extremely good at Recaptcha&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4CBFt"&gt;Buying a PS5 feels like trying to enter a supremely pricey raffle, securing a COVID vaccine slot in March 2021, or getting tickets to a &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt; preview in 2005 before we knew Joss Whedon was an awful human and Browncoats were insufferable. Every time a PS5 “drop” is imminent, my blood pressure rises to the occasion, trying to prepare me for a Sisyphean “Add to Cart — slog through a Recaptcha — watch the PS5 leave my cart” process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4BDr1"&gt;Again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvVzOT"&gt;I have gotten extremely good at Recaptcha. (I only learned Thursday that my ad-blocker may be responsible for my prolonged experience with Recaptcha and that I should white list any site I’m trying to buy a PS5 from.) I can spot the smudgiest bus and the most hidden car with ease. I can now safely tell you that it’s okay to not click on the one tiny bit of the bicycle in a lonely square but to not ignore things that look like a crosswalk but aren’t because Recaptcha’s database is different from the database you call a brain and cares not for logic but only for your furious clicks of things it approximates are other things. Recaptcha was created to teach computers to see, and I am confident that when a nuclear murder robot one day tracks me down in the midst of a crowd to forcefully shuffle off my mortal coil, I will have trained the damn thing with Recaptcha clicks to buy a PS5 that I still do not own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJbeO0"&gt;I didn’t take part in the initial rush to buy Sony’s next-generation console. I already had an Xbox Series X and told myself I’d get a PS5 when the furor had died down and an exclusive I was interested in was closer to launching. I’m old enough now that lining up for hours outside Walmart or Best Buy has lost any romance it once had. I like to think I am an adult and can patiently wait to buy the thing when it does not involve Black Friday rushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mthcuh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A whole weird sub-economy has sprung up around the PS5&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uOnzvu"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; is out in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5la9WX"&gt;Six months in, the furor to buy a PS5 has not died down. Thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; affecting everything from laptops to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, the PS5 supply has not been able to meet demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;Sony admitted the delay would last well into 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nAovp"&gt;If a PS5 were like my pepper grinder, video game preorders at GameStop, or most things at mom-and-pop stores, then I would simply put my name on a list at a retailer, put some money down, and patiently wait for my name to appear in the queue and then the PS5 on my doorstep. But that isn’t what has happened. Instead, a whole weird sub-economy has sprung up around the PS5 and other products affected by the semiconductor shortage, like the Xbox Series X, AMD’s entire new lineup of GPUs and CPUs, and Nvidia’s newest GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nW0GGV"&gt;Sites, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, have gotten very good at pointing readers to restocks that become obsolete minutes after the drops go live. Personalities on Twitter have developed whole brands around restocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU1Cal"&gt;Retailers have put labyrinthine mechanisms in place in an attempt to discourage scalpers who resell the products for hundreds more. In practice, scalpers still seem to have no issue stocking up, while typical consumers are left feeling like they’ve entered a lottery and the prize is spending hundreds of dollars. Enterprising programmers have attempted to halt scalpers in other ways, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-nvidia-rtx-3080-ebay-debacle-exposed-a-scalper-bot-1845133050"&gt;such as overbidding on products on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part, people are in a race with other people who just want to try out &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; and a guy who wants to try to sell a PS5 for $500 more on eBay or StockX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yq0rLy"&gt;NewEgg’s solution has been to transform buying a PS5 into an actual raffle. Newegg periodically announces free drawings. The prize? You get to buy a PS5! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In8PIq"&gt;Best Buy and Target’s apparent method to halt scalpers is to force you to wait between the first and second click to add the item to your cart and then require you to pick up the PS5 in person. Given I live in New York City, where one walks everywhere, I have been okay with losing out on these PS5s, as I assume it also means missing out on being robbed as walk home with a giant PS5 box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="l7aZYm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Retailers have put labyrinthine mechanisms in place in an attempt to discourage scalpers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36VZqa"&gt;Walmart and GameStop both ship you the actual device. That’s perfect! However, both are inconsistent with drops, and GameStop forces you to pad your purchase with gift certificates and games you probably don’t want. Worse, neither company has updated its website since, I think, HTML became the primary language of websites. After many Recaptchas, I got a PS5 into my cart at both stores, only to lose them when the checkout process ground to a crawl.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dr1var"&gt;Sony will sell you a PS5 directly but uses a randomized queue similar to the one San Diego Comic-Con relies on to book hotels. You can use as many computers as you like to sit in the queue (and you will be forced into a few Recaptcha processes along the way). But unlike the others, if you get in, you actually get in. No elation over getting a PS5 in your cart only to experience the extremely stupid but very real annoyance of losing it because they’re sold out in your area or the Waltons’ billion-dollar empire can’t handle a few thousand people trying to check out at once. You’re in. You get a PS5. You have to pay shipping because Sony only offers free shipping on purchases over $510. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpmxYU"&gt;And this awful and overly dramatic way of doing business isn’t going away anytime soon. The semiconductor shortage means there will be plenty of must-buy gadgets in short supply and the companies with barely functional webpages have feverish consumers in need of the next new thing over a barrel. They can make us jump through hoops just for the chance — the mere chance — of buying something because they have the supply and we all have the demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw2G3X"&gt;My PS5 apparently ships from Sony next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P28pPw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
