    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxmOa"&gt;The SpaceX Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station has been delayed again, this time to November 10th at 9:03PM ET, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/11/07/nasa-spacex-adjust-crew-2-station-departure-date/"&gt;NASA said Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. Although NASA had originally planned to have a changing of the guard with the Crew-2 astronauts greeting the Crew-3 team before Crew-2 departed, the space agency has decided to return the Crew 2 to Earth first, pushing that mission from Sunday to Monday, November 8th at 2:05PM ET, because of weather concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmpd0O"&gt;Wednesday so far has an 80 percent chance of favorable weather for liftoff, SpaceX noted in a tweet on Sunday. If all goes to plan the craft will take off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and dock with the ISS at about 7:10PM ET on November 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IFkpwZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following Crew-2’s return to Earth, Falcon 9 will launch Dragon’s third long-duration crew mission to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Space_Station&lt;/a&gt; as soon as Wednesday, November 10; weather forecast is 80% favorable for liftoff &lt;a href="https://t.co/xOFGVw3fOP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xOFGVw3fOP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SpaceX (@SpaceX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1457375316003880963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BFPCCc"&gt;After it was originally scheduled for an October 31st launch, the Crew-3 has seen several delays, for weather concerns, and once for a “minor medical issue” with one of the crew members. . Four astronauts—NASA’s Thomas Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron, and the European Space Agency’s Matthias Maurer— will travel aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft to begin a six-month stay in orbit on the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHPU31"&gt;Crew-3 is the third operational crewed flight for SpaceX as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which uses private craft to bring NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. If it ever launches, it will be the fifth time Space X has sent people to orbit aboard its Crew Dragon; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcT0EO"&gt;NASA’s livestream coverage of the launch will be available &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yAe7n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ra4r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhlgyT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk polls his Twitter followers, and a majority votes he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla stock </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-US-POLITICS-ELECTION-ECONOMY-TESLA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyzGx3raWrRYNjc3325O1p_XkrE=/0x152:3678x2604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108047/1234651136.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers | Photo by PATRICK PLEUL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JchOSd"&gt;Tesla CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;wealthiest&lt;/a&gt; person in the world Elon Musk tweeted out a poll Saturday, asking his Twitter followers whether he should sell 10 percent of his stock in the automaker, ostensibly to pay more tax. When the poll closed Sunday afternoon, 57.9 percent of more than 3.5 million participants had voted “yes,” and 42.1 percent voted “no.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coNDYE"&gt;“Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Saturday. He said in a subsequent tweet that he’d abide by the results of the poll “whichever way it goes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5dcmVn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPNAbf"&gt;Musk had been a vocal critic of a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-billionaires-income-tax-would-work-11635325201?mod=article_inline"&gt;proposal to tax unrealized gains&lt;/a&gt; on publicly traded assets for some of the wealthiest Americans. Under the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Billionaires%20Income%20Tax%20-%20One%20Pager.pdf"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), if assets increased in value, even if the person didn’t sell the assets, the person would have to pay taxes on the unrealized gain. It would basically end the tax loophole that lets billionaires defer capital gains taxes indefinitely, while still being able to borrow against that wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMidhq"&gt;“Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452792781726961668"&gt;tweeted in October&lt;/a&gt;, in response to a tweet expressing concerns about the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYvF1I"&gt;Wyden responded to Musk’s idea, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1457110175932846080?s=20"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday: “Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll, It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1PfxF"&gt;Saturday was also not the first time Musk has floated the idea of selling off some Tesla stock. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZP67-DECVw&amp;amp;ab_channel=Recode"&gt;Musk told journalist Kara Swisher at Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; in September that he planned to sell a big chunk of his Tesla stock options before they expired. “I have a bunch of [stock] options that are expiring early next year, so that’s a huge block of options we’ll sell in Q4,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnW8ZV"&gt;Swisher asked if he was surprised by how much Tesla’s stock had gone up. “I have gone on record and said I think [Tesla’s] stock price is too high, in my opinion,” Musk added later. “What am I supposed to do? I’m not the one making it go up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTbnZh"&gt;ProPublica journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eisingerj/status/1457099957635272707?s=21"&gt;Jesse Eisinger pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the third tweet in Musk’s Saturday thread — “Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock”— appeared to confirm the news site’s reporting on how &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;the ultra-wealthy avoid paying income taxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QHjEBm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457067398712942592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QheKCL"&gt;“Thank you for confirming our story: That for the ultra wealthy income taxes are essentially voluntary,” Eisinger tweeted, noting that Musk had previously called the story “misleading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIjOQY"&gt;As of Sunday afternoon, Musk had not commented on the poll results. We’ll update this post if he does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBAtbo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: November 7th, 2:37PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds final result of Musk’s Twitter poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says it will end OneDrive updates to Windows 7 and 8 in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9v0GGeYwWNwjU89uuuO3ff1UXR8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108787/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9RtmAN"&gt;Microsoft says OneDrive users on Windows, 7, 8, or 8.1 will be unable to sync their content to the cloud starting on March 1st, 2022, according to a blog &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/end-of-support-for-onedrive-desktop-application-on-windows-7-8/ba-p/2929066"&gt;post on its Tech Community forum&lt;/a&gt;. OneDrive will also no longer receive updates if it’s running on a system that doesn’t have Windows 10 or Windows 11 installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTDgN2"&gt;Files will still be accessible from the OneDrive app no matter what version of Windows you’re using — they’ll just no longer automatically upload to the cloud. To avoid any issues with OneDrive, Microsoft recommends upgrading to a newer version of Windows before March of next year. As for systems that aren’t able to run Windows 10 or Windows 11, Microsoft says that users can still back up their files by uploading them to the OneDrive web app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2zOco"&gt;In addition to halting updates and the ability to sync, &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/onedrive-sync-app-no-longer-supported-on-windows-7-8-or-8-1-a3bd41c7-5f82-42c3-aa46-de782581be2a"&gt;OneDrive on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 will lose support on January 1st&lt;/a&gt;. According to Microsoft, the reason for the change is “to focus resources on new technologies and operating systems, and to provide users with the most up-to-date and secure experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYxPfl"&gt;The lifecycle for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-8"&gt;Windows 8 ended in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, with Microsoft halting mainstream support for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-81"&gt;Windows 8.1 in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065122/microsoft-windows-7-end-of-support-lifecycle-millions-pcs"&gt;Windows 7 in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Now that Microsoft is planning to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533018/microsoft-windows-10-end-support-date"&gt; end support for Windows 10 in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, it might be time to start preparing for a Windows 11 upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will reportedly make games available via the App Store on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ro84Ro2U8gA3HdKD5gpspEoUVI=/81x0:879x532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108589/Screen_Shot_2021_11_02_at_1.24.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uKpxIa"&gt;Earlier this month, Netflix officially got into gaming by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;rolling out a mobile game service for Android users&lt;/a&gt;. While Netflix says that it's working on an iOS version of the service, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;tech reporter Mark Gurman says that Apple’s App Store policies will prevent Netflix from making games available from its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RS4ih"&gt;Apple bars third-party apps from functioning as a hub for games, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;become a point of contention with cloud gaming services&lt;/a&gt; like Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Google Stadia. Cloud gaming services can only get around this by offering their games through a web app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple"&gt;just like Facebook has already done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RUev3O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple will need to change its rules or grant Netflix an exemption”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsebeq"&gt;According to Gurman’s latest &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; newsletter, Netflix will tiptoe around Apple’s rules by making its games available via the App Store. This means that games won’t be downloadable or playable from the Netflix app — you’ll only be able to launch them from there. The service currently functions in this way on Android; the games are neatly packaged in a dedicated tab on the Netflix app, but are downloaded individually from the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWXEa6"&gt;While this setup is fine, it isn’t ideal for an all-in-one gaming service. Users should be able to download and play games from within the service itself. That’s why Gurman predicts that Netflix will eventually bring its games to the cloud. Again, this would work fine for Android, but Apple’s policies make it nearly impossible for cloud gaming to thrive, forcing services to settle for measly web apps. If and when Netflix decides to embrace cloud gaming, it’s unclear what will happen to the service on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dm6jE"&gt;“Apple will need to change its rules or grant Netflix an exemption,” Gurman says. “That leaves the ultimate success of Netflix’s service in the hands of Apple, a longtime partner but also a growing rival.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forza Horizon 5 will add on-screen sign language interpreters in a post-launch update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3b6UY8gBmOahTeoULjND-AMUF8=/295x0:1587x861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108394/forza_screen_cap.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Forza Horizon 4 will add sign language interpreters to cut scenes in a post-launch update | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o450zdpHZ7U&amp;amp;t=259s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Forza" target="_blank"&gt;Playground Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NoX385"&gt;The developers of &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; are planning to add on-screen sign language interpreters who would appear in a picture-in-picture display during the game’s cutscenes. The feature won’t be available when the game launches worldwide on November 9th, but Playground Games creative director Mike Brown wrote in a blog post on Xbox Wire that it would be “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="722oTq"&gt;“We’re constantly listening to the community to make &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; an inclusive experience for everyone to enjoy,” Brown &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/04/gaming-for-everyone-the-accessibility-features-of-forza-horizon-5/"&gt;said in a blog post on Xbox Wire&lt;/a&gt;. “With this in mind, the team is excited to share we are also working on American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) support for cinematics in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;.” He didn’t offer an exact release date for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvTjoX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; will have several other accessibility features available at launch. They include a game speed modification setting to play at reduced speeds when playing off line, a high contrast mode, a color blindness mode, customizable subtitles, a screen reader narrator who reads aloud text, buttons, and other game elements, and the ability to disable moving backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dU4bNG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o450zdpHZ7U?rel=0&amp;amp;start=259" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="935CuW"&gt;“We want everyone in the world to be able to experience our game, and with more than an estimated 400 million gamers with disabilities across the globe, it is vital that all players be able to tailor their gameplay in a way that works best for them,” Brown wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86DI0q"&gt;Forza Horizon 5 launches November 9th on Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC. Those who bought the Premium Edition or Premium Add-Ons Bundle got access to play the game starting November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2w4UOs"&gt;A little over two years ago when Rivian’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;all-electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; were still just blueprints, American carmakers Ford and GM were itching to invest. Fast-forward to the present, and Ford wound up becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;one of Rivian’s biggest partners alongside Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. What most people may not realize, however, is that Ford nearly lost its spot to GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cR456n"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ford-won-the-race-for-rivian-11636171218"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; describes some of the clandestine dealings in cinematic detail, and explores how Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe’s bond with Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s former president of global operations, became the foundation of Ford’s investment in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsHR4P"&gt;According to the&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Hinrichs first met with Scaringe in 2018. But because Ford had just missed its earnings targets, it wasn’t ready to invest in Rivian. This left room for GM, which had already started working on its electric vehicles, to slide in. However, &lt;em&gt;The WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says that leaders at Rivian remained skeptical of a deal with GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwjjJt"&gt;In 2019, Hinrichs met with Scaringe just after Amazon invested $700 million in Rivian. Hinrichs tried convincing him to reconsider a deal with Ford, after Scaringe said his company was on the verge of a deal with GM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Qs9WGf"&gt;Sensing hesitancy about GM, Mr. Hinrichs said he urged the young executive to reconsider. ‘Just because you got engaged to someone doesn’t mean you need to marry them,’ Mr. Hinrichs said he told Mr. Scaringe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TUXBJ6"&gt;Hinrichs gave Scaringe yet another chance to talk — both of them happened to have meetings in Seattle, and Hinrichs offered to give Scaringe a ride back to Detroit in Ford’s Gulfstream jet. Scaringe still had yet to seal a deal with GM, and during the flight, Hinrich and Scaringe laid out a deal. When they landed, Hinrichs helped Scaringe stay out of sight of nearby GM executives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tv0qWh"&gt;As the plane taxied toward a hangar used by both Ford and GM, executives on board spotted another jet outside the hangar with two GM-made black Cadillac Escalades waiting nearby. Mr. Hinrichs said he sensed Mr. Scaringe didn’t want to be seen by GM executives, so Mr Hinrichs requested that a Lincoln Navigator be pulled alongside the plane. When the door opened, Mr. Scaringe dashed down the plane’s steps and into the Navigator, keeping his head down as Mr. Hinrichs loaded their luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvlmns"&gt;Ford and Rivian’s talks continued overnight, and the two companies reached a deal at 4AM, according to the&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. In April 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech"&gt;Ford announced that it would invest $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in the startup — it has since invested a total of $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUug2t"&gt;The stories of how deals come together don’t always have as many twists and turns as the stories of how deals fall apart. This great &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ford-won-the-race-for-rivian-11636171218"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; has a little of both, and it’s a fascinating read. Go check out the dramatic tale, that has all the makings of a movie — or a really captivating novel.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Arcane is a slick and exciting intro to League of Legends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEY9sMVp5sF8cH4Pqbx5wSSAxd8=/240x0:1545x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70106449/Vi_fight.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWXeqg"&gt;For years, fans have been wondering just when the heck &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot would make an animated series. It seemed inevitable. The studio previously created stunning animated shorts to promote everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;new characters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700154/league-of-legends-world-2021-anthem-music-video"&gt;esports tournaments&lt;/a&gt;. And with an increasing focus on expanding &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s storytelling — something that’s tough to do within the confines of a team-based strategy game — a show made a whole lot of sense. Now, it’s real, with a nine-episode series called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;. The best part: not only is it a lot of fun, but you don’t have to know anything about &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTbT6U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is set (mostly) in a city called Piltover early on, which is on the verge of a big change that could impact the entirety of the fantasy realm of Runeterra: a pair of scientists are figuring out a way to harness the dangerous power of magic to use in everything from weapons to tools to transportation. Amidst this backdrop, the show follows a handful of characters throughout the city. Things start out with a street kid named Vi leading a small gang to a big score, heading to the upper reaches of the city to steal some expensive-looking gadgets. The heist, naturally, goes bad and ends with some exploding crystals. The perspective then shifts to the likes of the aforementioned scientists and an underworld kingpin with lots of scars and a big grudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gf5rGf"&gt;What’s great about &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;’s fantasy-meets-steampunk world is that it’s pretty easy to understand. The show doesn’t waste time with big lore dumps, nor does it expect you already know who these characters are. Vi, for instance, is one of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s most popular characters, but the show serves mostly as an origin story for her and a few others. For fans, it’s a cool chance to see how some of these characters came to be — you even learn about Vi’s iconic gauntlets — but for everyone else, you’re being introduced to interesting people at a pivotal point in their lives. No prior knowledge necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="irZkb1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Svs_hl897c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh1r2b"&gt;It helps that the story is relatively straightforward. There isn’t anything about &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; that I would call new or revolutionary. It’s a fairly typical fantasy tale that just happens to be really well done. The villains are intimidating, the would-be heroes are messy and relatable, the action is extremely satisfying to watch, and everything moves at a brisk pace. The best thing &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; has going for it is just how stylish it looks. Each frame looks like a gorgeous piece of hand-painted concept art; in motion, it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. It’s also a world that feels lived-in and fully realized. The slums of Piltover have a toxic green look to them (police officers even wear masks when they venture in), while the upper levels are bright, airy, and luxurious. I especially loved all of the strange mechanical creations that help keep the city alive and bustling. What I’m saying is, after watching the first few episodes, I want an &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; art book ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4ZjAK"&gt;One of the more interesting things about the show is how it’s being released. It’s not an all-you-can-watch binge-fest, nor are episodes dropping weekly. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; uses something of a hybrid format. The nine episodes are divided into chapters and are being released as three-episode bundles over the course of three weeks. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579993/fear-street-netflix-horror-trilogy-summer-movie"&gt;It’s reminiscent of Netflix’s experimental &lt;em&gt;Fear Stree&lt;/em&gt;t trilogy of horror movies&lt;/a&gt;.) For the first chapter, at least, it works well because the three episodes have their own clear arc, while episode four picks up some time later, though that’s as far as I’ve watched so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEyNC8"&gt;Early on,&lt;em&gt; Arcane&lt;/em&gt; walks a fine line. It’s both a tribute and an introduction to a vast fantasy realm that’s been around for a decade and has millions of existing fans. Those viewers will find a story with some exciting Easter eggs and a deeper look at characters that have been around for ages. Everyone else is in for a surprisingly thrilling adventure that doesn’t skimp on style. Really, the most jarring thing for newcomers might be if they’re inspired to play &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; itself, which is decidedly lacking in the style and speed that make the show work so well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sE8_Kr6c4stj8ukazGjMdrkuf1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105878/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnCDgO"&gt;Evidence is mounting that WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whatsapp-new-community-feature-apk-teardown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; first spotted&lt;/a&gt; the possibility in October, but now &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-communities/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has come forward&lt;/a&gt; with similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuvdZ"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;, the Communities feature appears to give group admins more power over groups. This includes the ability to create groups within groups, which may be similar to how channels are arranged beneath an umbrella Discord community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="WhatsApp Communities feature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yGOOzNKzFmslJfuWJ8wvNaYmB9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22991747/whatsapp_communities_beta.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by WABetaInfo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zDSuEp"&gt;Admins may be able to invite new users via a Community Invite Link and then start messaging other members. It’s hard to tell how exactly these chats might look right now, but &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; notes that they appear to be end-to-end encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwYVWd"&gt;It also looks like a subtle design change will help distinguish Communities from regular group chats. As &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; points out, community icons will be squares with rounded corners, a format that WhatsApp mistakenly enabled (and then quickly disabled) in October. There’s no word on when Communities will be officially rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ausP9C"&gt;By working on a Communities feature, WhatsApp may be trying to close the widening gap between it and other messaging apps like Telegram and Signal. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424769/whatsapp-privacy-policy-deadline-controversy-functionality"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; caused confusion among users about what it would share with parent company Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;sparking a mass exodus&lt;/a&gt; to those other apps. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;WhatsApp went down along with Facebook’s entire network&lt;/a&gt; of apps last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712191/telegram-70-million-new-users-facebook-outage-surge-whatsapp"&gt;Telegram gained a whopping 70 million users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly is aware of the level of ‘problematic use’ among its users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4cl22QviTCKJZdg_pANy3B-TXbg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105825/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;More leaked documents suggest Facebook is aware of its problems | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvIzrM"&gt;Facebook’s own internal research found 1 in 8 of its users reported compulsive social media use that interfered with their sleep, work, and relationships— what the social media platform calls “problematic use” but is more commonly known as “internet addiction,” the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bad-for-you-360-million-users-say-yes-company-documents-facebook-files-11636124681"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="366TOG"&gt;The social media platform had a team focused on user well-being, which suggested ways to curb problematic use, some of which were put into place. But the company shut down the team in 2019, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NB488C"&gt;Pratiti Raychoudhury, a vice president of research for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta, Facebook’s new parent&lt;/a&gt; company, writes in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/wsj-report-ignores-our-approach-to-well-being-research/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; misrepresented the research (a claim the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681056/facebook-vp-disputes-report-wall-street-journal-instagram-teens-clegg"&gt;has made&lt;/a&gt; about some of the other articles the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has produced based on Facebook’s internal documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TR3YR2"&gt;She says the company “has been engaged and supportive throughout our multiyear effort to better understand and empower people who use our services to manage problematic use. That’s why this work has taken place over multiple years, including now.” Raychoudhury argues that “problematic use does not equal addiction,” and that the company ships “features to help people manage their experiences on our apps and services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6oc4d"&gt;The report is the latest in an ongoing series from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; called the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;, based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen, which suggest Facebook is aware of the problems its platforms can cause. One set of reports, for instance, suggested Facebook knew that its Instagram platform was toxic for teenage users. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Haugen testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on October 5th, saying Facebook was “internally dysfunctional,” and that it was unlikely to change its behaviors without action from external regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nE11f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal appeals court temporarily halts new Biden vaccine rule for companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tXVMP7qOG7PCm3YyYVQStUPItZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105574/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;New vaccine rules have been frozen by an appeals court | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSYpdy"&gt;A federal appeals court on Saturday issued a stay against the Biden administration’s vaccine rules for US companies. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22757969/biden-covid-vaccine-osha-cms-masking-federal-mandate"&gt;rule announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; requires workers at businesses with 100 or more employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, or submit to weekly testing. The rule requires affected companies to provide paid time for employees to get vaccinated, and to ensure any unvaccinated employees wear face masks while at work. The deadline for meeting the provisions is January 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiljM"&gt;Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1457045504710356999"&gt;petitioned for an emergency stay&lt;/a&gt; of the rule, which was to be enforced by the Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The petition was joined by attorneys general from Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah, and several private businesses and advocacy groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvUpzR"&gt;The three-judge panel with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/21/21-60845.0.pdf"&gt;said Saturday&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that it was issuing the stay “because the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the mandate.” The court didn’t provide additional detail for why it issued the stay, but the Biden administration now has until 5PM ET on Monday to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQIJFu"&gt;Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda said in a statement that the Labor Department was “confident” it has the legal authority to issue the rule, and was prepared to defend it in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjBATH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
