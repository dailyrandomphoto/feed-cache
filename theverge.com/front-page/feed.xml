    <title>The next big social network trend? Shortform audio</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Forget long Clubhouse convos, these founders see voice notes as the future&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AuPOki"&gt;“So I’ve identified a few metrics and KPIs that I’m going to start tracking in order to better my overall life experience,” Farbod Nowzad says, seemingly seriously, into his phone microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIpQlz"&gt;He lists his KPIs, or key performance indicators: the number of smoothies he drinks per week, the amount of time he spends listening to live techno music, and the number of rooftop bars he visits. I tap through to hear more. Someone named Nikolai recommends people maximize the “number of water fixtures that come into your line of sight on a daily basis” and the “number of times that you can say, ‘I’ll have the usual’ and have someone else understand it.” More people chime in, all in audio clips under 90 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYspo0"&gt;This, to multiple founders and investors, is the future of audio: shortform recordings that are social, shareable, and thought-provoking, or, at a bare minimum, make you want to listen and say something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hji0oK"&gt;Multiple startups, including &lt;a href="https://beams.fm/"&gt;Beams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://quest.audio/"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;, and Nowzad’s app &lt;a href="https://pludo.xyz/"&gt;Pludo&lt;/a&gt; are betting their efforts, and investors’ cash, that there’s business to be had in this user-generated audio. Even the world’s largest social platform sees this as a possibility; Facebook announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;Soundbites&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, a forthcoming product also built around shareable, short audio clips. They all see what’s happening on TikTok — masses of people creating viral video clips — and want to repeat that success with just sound. It could be the next viral frontier, and a medium that mints new stars and makes everyone lots of cash, should any of these apps actually take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WzOPyY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Can solely audio go viral?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SUeyf1"&gt;The best way to think of these efforts is as apps for voice notes, except your voice notes have a time limit and people can respond to them with more voice notes that also have a time limit. Oh, and the voice notes aren’t edited, either. It’s like taking the social aspect of Clubhouse but limiting it with a time constraint, although the analogy that keeps coming up when I talk to the founders is Twitter, and &lt;em&gt;blogs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUkZ5O"&gt;“[Once we had blogs] we then had tools like Twitter and Tumblr that removed all of the complexity and just said, ‘You don’t need to think of yourself as bloggers, just type words into the box and press publish,’ and that led to this unlock of so much creativity,” says Austin Petersmith, the founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://racket.com/c/help"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt;, another shortform audio platform that’s currently in beta and has raised an initial seed round of funding, although Petersmith wouldn’t disclose the amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ME0Uz"&gt;Giving people an online microphone and a time constraint, he says, makes podcasting easier to approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtX8XK"&gt;“Hundreds of millions of people are making TikToks actively, hundreds of millions of people are blogging actively, and there are less than a million people podcasting actively,” he says. “I think it makes no sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WyhfF12YjnPHllHD0bGfu1v4HPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720086/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_2.08.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the Racket interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pjy05z"&gt;Racket limits people to nine minutes of recording, which right now, they can only do on the web. An app is in development, though, as are plans to make the platform open to everyone. Petersmith says 18,000 minutes of audio have been published since the company’s launch this year; 70,000 people have listened to a Racket, which is what they call the audio snippets; and 17,000 people have signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0RD8a"&gt;But why the audio mania now? Alan Sternberg, co-founder of Beams, which he and his co-founder say has raised $3 million, says the apps’ arrivals come from a confluence of factors: the improvement of phones’ microphones, Clubhouse popularizing the idea of social audio, and rapid speech-to-text transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWctkg"&gt;Notably, none of these apps offer RSS feeds to distribute content to other apps, essentially setting them up as proprietary vehicles through which people can consume and create content. They very much are not podcasts. Sternberg says RSS is a problem, even, because it doesn’t allow for a social network to grow in one app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y96mUZ"&gt;“I think the problem with RSS, when you look at podcasting, it’s like a decentralized technology that wasn’t made to be a social network,” he says, suggesting that’s why apps like Beams need to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pELJYk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zy-QZHzWYE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2K7Z6z"&gt;Meanwhile, for investors, the shortform audio trend makes sense as a way to build on the success of live social audio apps and improve on them, at least in one investor’s mind. Jake Chapman, an investor in Racket, points out multiple issues he sees with live audio. Namely, conversations veer off track from the promised room topic, as is the nature of conversation, and because they’re live and not recorded, at least in Clubhouse’s case, the app can’t optimize for discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8yctm"&gt;“I think the short snippet audio companies have a much better chance of success [than apps like Clubhouse],” he says. “I think they can scratch the same kind of itch. So Racket, for instance, because rackets are prerecorded, so they’re asynchronous, and because they’re short, the signal-to-noise ratio is completely flipped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrq1ev"&gt;He also says apps that specialize in longform audio will have higher costs when transcribing hours-long conversations and optimizing discovery around them, versus shortform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bPIeoZsOJgUWMn_owtNaWYnGgTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720077/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_2.06.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Quest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of Quest, a shortform audio app focused on career advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LDR7gy"&gt;Of course, podcasting has already existed for years and is having &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; Big Tech moment now, too. Amazon recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549391/amazon-music-art19-hosting-platform-advertisers"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; a podcasting hosting company, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;the podcast network Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, and Spotify has spent upward of a billion dollars on exclusive content deals and acquiring companies across the space. No one really thought podcasting was broken, but Big Tech saw an opportunity to cash in on it, mostly through serving and targeting ads against shows, and seized it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0Lp5A"&gt;Spotify notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; Anchor in 2019, arguably the app that pioneered the idea of mobile audio recording. It didn’t focus on shortform audio, however, and was more designed to democratize podcast creation, as it still tries to do today. Anchor attempted to make its app a place to listen, as well as create, but failed to ever make it a destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YTdno"&gt;That’s the real hurdle for these startups. Podcasts thrive when they’re available across platforms — some shows do well on YouTube, others find an audience on Apple Podcasts, and still others do well on Pocket Casts. But these new apps and their founders see locked-down content as the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VIMYZU"&gt;These startups face two main hurdles, though: Facebook, which is going to enter the space soon and plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay out $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; to creators across its platform over the next year, and the outstanding question that exists, of whether people want to hear this audio format. Will anyone actually listen to a stranger give them ideas of KPIs to optimize their life? Or would they just prefer a tweet?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is on sale for $619 at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9pekq"&gt;Whether you’d like to admit it or not, school is quickly approaching. And if you’re in need of a reliable laptop that won’t force you to completely deplete your savings, Chromebooks aren’t a bad way to go. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; deliver great value for the money, and many offer terrific performance for far less than you would pay for a more premium machine. Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is one such device, even if the high-end convertible is one of the more expensive Chromebooks on the market right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEUc0Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746320001237385626#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Currently discounted at Best Buy to $619&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 model packs in 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i5, which is more than enough processing power for most people. Moreover, it boasts a great keyboard and a brilliant 3:2 screen, along with two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and enough battery life for a full day in the classroom — virtual or otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Apple’s pint-sized answer to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; still produces good sound for its size, though, and Siri remains a viable alternative to Alexa and Google Assistant, despite lagging behind when it comes to features and functionality. The compact smart speaker also plays nice with HomeKit-compatible devices and Apple Music, rendering it a device really built for those who are already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem. Normally $100, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598683-REG%2Fapple_aphomepmsg_homepod_mini_space_gray.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F16%2F22577815%2Facer-chromebook-spin-713-apple-homepod-mini-microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering a rare $10 discount&lt;/a&gt; on Home Pod Mini, bringing the price down to $90 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xpKyaN"&gt;With COVID-19 restrictions easing and in-person gatherings become more commonplace again, now might not be a bad time to pick up an extra controller for your Xbox One, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, or Windows 10 machine. Thankfully, the black incarnation of Microsoft’s latest Xbox Wireless Controller is compatible with all three and remains available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Shock-Blue-one/dp/B08DF248LD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%2F8xn59crbsqgz%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26ranSiteID%3DVZfI20jEa0c-HbHu3oCkeQ1z2svgZK2uRQ%26epi%3DVZfI20jEa0c-HbHu3oCkeQ1z2svgZK2uRQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__iglaeqnhj9kfq1cckk0sohzif22xudv630gxj2fe00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528VZfI20jEa0c-HbHu3oCkeQ1z2svgZK2uRQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_iglaeqnhj9kfq1cckk0sohzif22xudv630gxj2fe00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store for $49&lt;/a&gt;, matching its second-lowest price. Unlike the previous model, the new-ish controller features a textured grip, USB-C support, and a dedicated Share button, letting you quickly capture and share your content with the press of a button. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21452750/microsoft-xbox-series-x-controller-1tb-expansion-cards-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The stakes for fighting misinformation are life and death</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DSZ6HM"&gt;The United States surgeon general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578431/white-house-surgeon-general-facebook-youtube-twitter-covid-19-misinformation-vaccines"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; this week calling for a whole-of-society response to health misinformation, calling it a “serious threat to public health.” It took a sweeping look at a wide range of misinformation, on everything from masks to unproven drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qpfBV"&gt;But the focus of Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s remarks &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/15/politics/surgeon-general-vaccine-misinformation-advisory/index.html"&gt;circled back&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines. Daily vaccination rates have stalled out at around 500,000 shots per day, and in many pockets of the country, a majority of people aren’t getting immunized. The US is struggling to bump those numbers up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIRkXH"&gt;Misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines spreads fast, and so do the accompanying consequences. The rapid spread of the more transmissible Delta coronavirus variant makes them even easier to see. Case counts are going up around the country, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/7/13/22576416/nyc-covid-cases-rise-in-areas-with-low-vaccination-rates"&gt;in areas&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html"&gt;low vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/unvaccinated-covid19-los-angeles-county-hospitalizations/10887037/"&gt;Every person hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with COVID-19 in Los Angeles County is unvaccinated. &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/6242"&gt;In Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, 94 percent of COVID-19 cases since May were among the unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FN2rL7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1XuIz"&gt;In Missouri, the new center of the Delta-driven US surge, health care workers are exhausted by the avoidable COVID-19 cases and deaths they see every day. They’re frustrated that people in their communities aren’t getting vaccinated. In addition to fighting the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/15/springfield-missouri-delta-outbreak/"&gt;health officials are battling&lt;/a&gt; theories that the vaccine is causing the spike in cases, apathy from young people who think they don’t need to get vaccinated, and the false idea that the vaccine contains a microchip. With &lt;a href="https://data.news-leader.com/covid-19-vaccine-tracker/missouri/29/"&gt;much of the population&lt;/a&gt; in the state avoiding shots, the virus is inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oP9KfY"&gt;“We are going to see more people get really sick. We are going to see a lot of people die,” Katie Towns, the acting health director at the Springfield-Greene County Health Department in Missouri, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/15/springfield-missouri-delta-outbreak/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV4CNX"&gt;Misinformation is also winning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;in Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, where the health department stopped all vaccine outreach to young people after pressure and backlash from conservative lawmakers. Anti-vaxxers and others opposed to public health measures have the ear of people in power, and it’s frightening, psychologist and anti-vaccine researcher Seth Kalichman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578519/vaccine-politicization-tennessee-covid-hpv-flu"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oorVGY"&gt;Vaccines are some of the most powerful public health tools at our disposal. Because they’re so good, and particularly because the COVID-19 vaccines are so good, the fallout from any drops in vaccination rates is predictable. When people don’t get vaccinated, people get sick, and people die. That means the stakes for &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf"&gt;proposals and efforts&lt;/a&gt; to curb vaccine misinformation — crack down on social media platforms, distribute correct information, develop health literacy programs — couldn’t be higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sx6qGZ"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHfsse"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lFW43s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/12/flu-jab-may-reduce-severe-effects-of-covid-suggests-study"&gt;Flu jab may reduce severe effects of Covid, suggests study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;COVID-19 patients who had a flu shot were less likely to have a stroke or admitted to emergency departments than patients who didn’t, a new study found. It’s not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccine. (Ian Sample/&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Studying people who don’t respond to the COVID-19 vaccine, for example, can help us understand the immune system. (Roxanne Khamsi/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MAVbj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bat-scientists-warn-that-the-world-may-never-know-covid-19-origins-11626026153?st=xzj3j18omaz5awx&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;Bat Scientists Warn That the World May Never Know Covid-19 Origins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Research that tries to track down a smoking gun is challenging and often fails. Scientists also often disagree on what various data means. (Amy Dockser Marcus/&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odMcn4"&gt;Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="km92xC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01893-0"&gt;Quarter-dose of Moderna COVID vaccine still rouses a big immune response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;A smaller dose of the vaccine could still help protect people from COVID-19. That could make limited supplies of the shot stretch further. (Elie Dolgin/&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB6tnb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/12/when-and-how-will-we-know-covid-19-booster-shots/"&gt;When and how will we know if we need Covid-19 booster shots?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech are pushing for a third shot in the COVID-19 vaccine regimen. Federal agencies in the United States are pushing back, saying that the data doesn’t show a need yet. The booster debate also raises issues of vaccine equity. (&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0efwX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574180/fda-johnson-warning-covid-vaccine-guillain-barre"&gt;FDA adds warning about a nerve condition to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who got the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot have slightly higher rates of a condition called Guillain–Barré syndrome, which can cause weakness and coordination problems, than would be expected in the general population. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pcWjDM"&gt;And I went back and forth about it for a while. It’s almost like I was paralyzed from trying to do the right thing, if that makes sense……… it was torture. But it just seemed like the advice about vaccinations and pregnant women, at that time, it was still up in the air. It was still a situation where no one was telling me, you know, It’s undisputed, Cheyenne, these are the facts, this is what you should do. So I just tried to make the right choice, the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XfR5U2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/cheyenne-parker-wnba-basketball-atlanta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Player’s Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Atlanta Dream star Cheyenne Parker wrote about grappling with whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 3.5 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 188,726,053 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,062,486 people who have died worldwide — 608,336 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80ZwyN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aB5sN7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="md64mw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa’s latest celebrity voices are Shaq and Melissa McCarthy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HF_RUPVYLFPlsZavLvWBi8YHrcE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69590087/dseifert_201025_4263_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFQPfL"&gt;Shaquille O’Neal and Melissa McCarthy are the latest celebrities to lend their voices to Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-introduce-me-to-melissa-and-shaq"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The two voices can provide weather reports, jokes, and personal stories when asked using the wake words “Hey Melissa” or “Hey Shaq.” Both voices cost $4.99 individually, and are rolling out in the US now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2ahqG"&gt;Amazon kicked off its celebrity Alexa voices initiative &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21013145/amazon-echo-alexa-samuel-l-jackson-celebrity-voice-now-available-price"&gt;with Samuel L. Jackson in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and says this Alexa voice skill was the top selling digital purchase on Amazon.com the day it was launched. In 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436292/amazon-alexa-amitabh-bachchan-celebrity-voice-india-bollywood-star-pricing-release-date"&gt;followed up with Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan&lt;/a&gt;. None of these celebrities replace Alexa’s default voice, but instead offer responses to specific requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4dkC45"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5o_vmcCbrkE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2O3MXP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fnb451SHPMI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MXbTVc"&gt;If you’re after a new Alexa voice for all of your requests, then Amazon says it’s also releasing a new voice option, which you can enable with the command “Alexa, change your voice.” Separately, there’s also a new wake word, “Ziggy,” if you’re tired of the existing selection (which currently includes Alexa, Computer, Echo, and Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lf7qIj"&gt;To enable either celebrity voices, you can ask Alexa for an introduction. The commands “Alexa, introduce me to Shaq,” or “Alexa, introduce me to Melissa” should do the trick. Alternatively, you can manually enable &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XW88QZB/ref=sxts_spks_0_0_fe93319a-8afe-47d4-a26b-1cf04483ed5e?pd_rd_w=O2qZB&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=fe93319a-8afe-47d4-a26b-1cf04483ed5e&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=V1632KG3BYWC589939XH&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=eb63b2db-1485-4d9e-9bda-67920148236d&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=tvO3c&amp;amp;qid=1626434273&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;each&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Melissa-McCarthy-celebrity-personality-Alexa/dp/B08XVTH3ZP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=melissa+mccarthy&amp;amp;qid=1626434258&amp;amp;s=digital-skills&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; via Amazon’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epomaker’s NT68 is a mechanical alternative to your MacBook’s keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HUxPZgYzqkoT1Ka7IjdDlKL6tXg=/1x0:1113x741/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589947/nt68_photo_3_min_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NT68 is designed to sit on top of your laptop’s existing keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epomaker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVmp5b"&gt;If you can’t stand to type on a Macbook’s scissor switch keyboard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;let alone a butterfly model&lt;/a&gt;, and you don’t fancy lugging around one of the small number of laptops with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7495073/msi-mechanical-keyboard-gt80-titan-laptop-ces"&gt;full-on mechanical keyboard built in&lt;/a&gt;, then Epomaker’s new wireless keyboard might be one for you. The NT68 is designed to sit on top of a MacBook or other laptop’s existing keyboard so your fingers don’t have to put up with their rubbery key switches for a single second longer than they need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmFEpo"&gt;It’s not an entirely new idea (&lt;a href="https://nuphy.com/products/nutype-f1"&gt;Nuphy’s NuType F1 keyboard&lt;/a&gt; is another recent example) but the quality and specs of Epomaker’s previous keyboards make the NT68 worthy of attention. It can be hardwired over USB-C, connected via Bluetooth to up to three devices, and its switches are hot-swappable so you can modify the keyboard’s typing feel without having to get a soldering iron out. It uses what’s known as a 65 percent layout, which means you only get five rows of keys and no dedicated function row. It’s compact, but at the cost of some extra keys. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKTDkD0nwXyIUXqmKrjFjcNCwGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22721291/nt68_bg3_min.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epomaker&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ah yes. Ergonomics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tnrX0w"&gt;Oh, and there’s also RGB backlighting if you care about that sort of thing. The NT68 features what Epomaker is calling an “invisible stand,” and its magnetic case can prop up any phones or tablets you want to pair it to. Its 1,900 mAh battery is rated for between two and five weeks of wireless use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa4tKx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If &lt;/em&gt;I was ever going to go to the effort of carrying around a little mechanical keyboard to use on top of a laptop, then I’d be giving the NT68 serious consideration. But that’s a big “if.” For starters, even as someone who owns around half a dozen different keyboards, it still seems straight up inconvenient to carry around an extra keyboard to replace the perfectly functional one built into my laptop. Even then, I couldn’t see myself bothering to put the keyboard &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; a laptop’s keyboard when it’s much more ergonomic and comfortable to sit it on the desk in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VszF3O"&gt;But hey, I’m not going to tell you how to live your life. Epomaker is yet to announce a release date or pricing for the NT68, but it’s inviting people to sign up for updates &lt;a href="https://nt68comingsoon.epomaker.com/"&gt;over on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi overtakes Apple as number two smartphone vendor for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoEJx-ejU8P8R7snEItUUlFIHFo=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589716/DSCF5698.jpg_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A phone repair store at a technology market in Shenzhen, China. | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F52BFY"&gt;Xiaomi is now the second largest smartphone vendor based on worldwide shipments in the second quarter of 2021, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from Canalys. The Chinese company captured 17 percent of global market share, according to the research firm, just behind Samsung’s 19 percent but ahead of Apple’s 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gn7Ak"&gt;BBK’s Oppo and Vivo rounded out the list of top five vendors at 10 percent apiece. All five companies grew their shipments year on year, but what’s notable is just how much Xiaomi has managed to increase its volume — it shipped 83 percent more phones than in Q2 2020, whereas Samsung grew shipments 15 percent and Apple by just one percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxj4as"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've moved up one more spot! Just in from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Canalys&lt;/a&gt;, we are now the 2nd largest smartphone brand worldwide in terms of shipments. This amazing milestone couldn't have been achieved without our beloved Mi Fans! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoMiWithoutYou?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NoMiWithoutYou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT with ✌️from your Xiaomi smartphone :) &lt;a href="https://t.co/kKfuTK8K7J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kKfuTK8K7J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xiaomi (@Xiaomi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xiaomi/status/1415731357368471553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXhzMt"&gt;“Xiaomi is growing its overseas business rapidly,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton says, citing sales boosts in regions including Western Europe, Africa, and Latin America. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McMFbf"&gt;Canalys says global smartphone shipments grew by 12 percent last quarter. Much of the growth seen by smartphone makers is at the expense of Huawei, however, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21114885/huawei-overtakes-apple-2019-analysts-strategy-analytics-counterpoint-research-canalys"&gt;itself overtook Apple in 2019&lt;/a&gt; but has since been essentially shut out of the worldwide market due to US-imposed sanctions and trading bans. So far, Xiaomi appears to be the biggest beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter adds captions to voice tweets more than a year after they first launched</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foo8fxaVSe1QVmIBW-o5TtzioFg=/0x200:1200x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589056/E6XiiGlWQAYISTV.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captions on a voice tweet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UAdrN"&gt;Twitter is now rolling out captions for voice tweets, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415806764113670145"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter first launched voice tweets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;quickly criticized at the time&lt;/a&gt; by accessibility advocates for not having captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W0cfd"&gt;Now, when you make a voice tweet (something you can only do on the iOS app right now), captions will be automatically generated in supported languages, which are English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, French, Indonesian, Korean, and Italian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npgjyG"&gt;To see the captions on a tweet, you can click or tap the CC icon in the top-right corner of the voice tweet window. Captions only appear on new voice tweets, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;so you won’t see them on older ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLFdhH"&gt;Below is a screenshot of what the captions and the CC icon look like on the web, taken from a voice tweet that I made while writing this article:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YD_udtL0AuyfYaYiESAUCkVZaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720808/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_4.26.51_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6X7WpS"&gt;You can also try to listen to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1415814919669260288"&gt;my voice tweet here&lt;/a&gt; and follow along with the captions, though I will warn you that my tweets eventually auto delete. If you’re reading this article a little while after it was published, the voice tweet might be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bOVXE"&gt;When voice tweets launched, it also came to light that there wasn’t a dedicated team at Twitter for accessibility at the time — instead, employees had to volunteer their own time for accessibility work. The company has since fixed that, announcing that it had formed teams &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible"&gt;to focus on accessibility&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r3sWB"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to make Twitter accessible for everyone, we’re rolling out automated captions for Voice Tweets to iOS,” Twitter’s head of global accessibility Gurpreet Kaur said in a statement. “Though it’s still early and we know it won’t be perfect at first, it’s one of many steps we’re taking to expand and strengthen accessibility across our service, and we look forward to continuing our journey to create a truly inclusive service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FamdOk"&gt;Twitter also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;offers captions in Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, its Clubhouse-like social audio rooms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is reportedly in talks to buy the $30 billion foundry company AMD spun off a decade ago</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnbEjP14IxQo_G8xnQoaIGIf9UQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588670/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQfD9C"&gt;In 2008, chipmakers Intel and AMD took two distinct paths: Intel kept manufacturing its own chips to maintain full control, while AMD decided to spin off its semiconductor business as GlobalFoundries, relying on it and other manufacturers to provide the actual silicon. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Intel is looking to snap up AMD’s former fabs as well, in a deal that could value them at $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mSOK"&gt;It’s clear from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story that the deal isn’t a sure thing, and GlobalFoundries outright denied that it was in talks with Intel. But it’s possible Intel’s negotiating with the investment firm that owns GlobalFoundries instead, as the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;points out. It’s also intriguing that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a “no comment” from Intel itself — that’s sometimes a canary to indicate a company &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; comment, just off the record or on deep background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kha7ys"&gt;(“We will decline to comment on rumor and speculation,” an Intel spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="481eGh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel’s pushing fabs on multiple fronts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcJsmf"&gt;There’s an obvious reason why Intel might want GlobalFoundries — Intel is actually ramping up its foundry business now. In an attempt to turn around the struggling company, new Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;announced in March that Intel would no longer go it alone&lt;/a&gt;, outsourcing more of its chip production to third-party foundries, agreeing to produce more chips for other companies using its own foundries, and also investing in new fabs itself. That included a $20 billion investment in new facilities in Arizona, but it could take many years for new buildings to get constructed and ramp up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RSQWX"&gt;In the meanwhile, it could snap up GlobalFoundries, the #4 foundry in the world (&lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210224-10675.html"&gt;according to TrendForce&lt;/a&gt;), one that accounts for 7 percent of all foundry business by revenue. That won’t put Intel on the same footing as a giant TSMC or Samsung (which together account for an estimated 74 percent), but it’d be a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txhn4J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; took &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/07/making-semiconductors-is-hard/"&gt;a tour of GlobalFoundries’ facility in Malta, NY&lt;/a&gt; just last week, if you’d like to hear what it’s like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey says Square has a new Bitcoin business named TBD</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bitcoin Conference Draws Cryptocurrency Fans To Miami" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BShgN1xQbTyleYeN-JwvId0M0dY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588606/1321753461.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yGA1yN"&gt;Jack Dorsey, CEO of both Twitter and Square, is enough of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years"&gt;fan of cryptocurrency &lt;/a&gt;that Square’s push into the area won’t stop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569309/square-hardware-wallet-bitcoin-jack-dorsey"&gt;at releasing a hardware wallet&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the company is creating a new business, to go with existing units like Tidal and Cash App, which is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yC2Lf3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like our new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; hardware wallet, we’re going to do this completely in the open. Open roadmap, open development, and open source. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@brockm&lt;/a&gt; is leading and building this team, and we have some ideas around the initial platform primitives we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415765943385563139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHSWHW"&gt;What does that mean exactly? Is the new business called TBD, or is the name “to be determined” at a later date? In the words of at least one editor of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “I absolutely do not know what he is talking about.” When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Square declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc25hx"&gt;What we do know comes mostly from the unit’s new leader Mike Brock, who confidently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795489954361347"&gt;tweeted out several names of TBD’s founding team&lt;/a&gt;, and says he’s “super excited to return to the world of open source.” Further updates on exactly what TBD is doing should come via Twitter and GitHub accounts. But exactly when those updates might arrive is, well, TBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sea4Dn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@jack&lt;/a&gt; said, we're going to be biasing towards being open and transparent. So we'll be sharing a lot more about our plans in the coming days and weeks. We're also going to be thinking of ways to include the community in our planning. So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Brock (@brockm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795491879624705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
