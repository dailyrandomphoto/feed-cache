    <title>Panasonic photoshopped a white man’s head onto a Black man’s body</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rMF0MPWvLZwHfHqWsLLMyykN2eM=/287x0:7714x4951/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779333/GN01_CUT06_210728.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJZKj0"&gt;We recently wrote how Panasonic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/8/25/22641563/panasonic-soundslayer-wigss-wireless-gaming-speaker-sc-gn01-price-release-date-specs"&gt;maybe went &lt;em&gt;a little &lt;/em&gt;overboard with wacky promotional images for its new SoundSlayer wearable gaming speaker&lt;/a&gt;. Fun, right? Here’s something less amusing: it appears that Panasonic couldn’t be bothered to take actual photos of its product on actual human beings, so it digitally inserted them into royalty-free pictures from Shutterstock and Getty Images. And then, it appears to have done something worse: stick a white man’s head on a Black man’s body, altering his skin tone to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZpWHL"&gt;Let’s start with the less egregious example. Here’s Panasonic’s image of its headset blowing a gamer’s mind:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5jkK23at9eHn3kMFx5ou4QVko5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805194/panasonic_sc_gn01_wearable_immersive_gaming_speaker_wigss_2200.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Panasonic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P94ba3"&gt;If you type “nerdy gamer” into Shutterstock, it’s the &lt;em&gt;very first result&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5BvvXo2PUsO0KdkpaRcg3Tz9iXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805866/1405_2021_08_25_1405_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ehxgrc"&gt;There’s no question &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterstock.com%2Fimage-photo%2Fnerdy-gamer-controller-329959085&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this image from Lasse Behnke&lt;/a&gt; is the one Panasonic used — but the model sure isn’t wearing a Panasonic neck speaker. (It’s also not clear why the DualShock 4’s light bar has been edited out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AtOEw"&gt;Okay, now for the ugly one. First, the image Panasonic provided alongside its new product, and below it, the original photo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAeMHSvtGdoKttVidzM0U11G-Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805328/GN01_CUT06_210728.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Panasonic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W8uXgMbWkAqqsHMbHI-uRLDb7P0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805886/gettyimages_1210346459_2048x2048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Fdetail%2Fphoto%2Fplaying-video-games-royalty-free-image%2F1210346459&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;blackCAT (Getty Images)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Young African American man eating pizza, drinking beer and playing video games.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6bGsBj"&gt;These might look like very different people, but that’s the editing at work — they clearly have the same hands, the same shirt (with the same exact creases), the same arm definition, and the same throat, in the same posture. Someone took the Black man’s body, stuck a white man’s head on top, lightened his skin, and changed the color of his game controller and his shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8FDkqR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a quick juxtaposition to make it even clearer: this Black man's head was digitally replaced. &lt;a href="https://t.co/X8Ac1IlDu6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/X8Ac1IlDu6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1430943826424647685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kEYcfT"&gt;Whose head is on whose body, though? There’s little question that it was the Black man whose identity got erased, instead of the other way around. I took a look at the EXIF data in Panasonic’s picture, and it reads: “Young African American man eating pizza, drinking beer and playing video games.” Not only is that the exact title of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Fdetail%2Fphoto%2Fplaying-video-games-royalty-free-image%2F1210346459&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Getty Image above&lt;/a&gt;, the EXIF also mentions Getty Images and photographer blackCAT, and so it’s &lt;em&gt;extremely &lt;/em&gt;likely Panasonic started with the Black man’s photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0QpBM0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why, Panasonic, why?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1dyG3o"&gt;It’s less clear whether anything would actually prohibit Panasonic from modifying the images in this way, or whether the original photographers and models have any say at all — when you buy a royalty-free image on these platforms, you buy the ability to freely use and modify it, without having to negotiate with the artist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieVVUB"&gt;And while Shutterstock’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterstock.com%2Flicense&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;license agreement does say&lt;/a&gt; customers may not “Portray any person depicted in Visual Content (a “Model”) in a way that a reasonable person would find offensive,” Getty Images &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gettyimages.com%2Feula&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642035%2Fpanasonic-photoshopped-white-head-black-body-photo-picture-gaming-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;doesn’t seem to have&lt;/a&gt; any similar terms. Getty’s restrictions are primarily around “editorial” content, so that journalists’ photos of real-world news events aren’t used in advertising or endorsements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sU7FR"&gt;After we brought these images to Panasonic’s attention yesterday afternoon, it pulled every promo image featuring a human being from its image distribution folder for this product. As of this morning, a representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s still looking into the matter but couldn’t offer a timetable for a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtTWoW"&gt;It’s not the first time a tech company has replaced a Black man’s head with a white one in a promotional image, by the way: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/aug/26/microsoft-race-gaffe"&gt;Microsoft was caught doing it on its Polish website in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will take a smaller cut of publishers’ sales if they join Apple News</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfaN-VxINaeX3d3RUJrAC0R11s0=/194x0:2228x1356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779318/Screen_Shot_2021_08_26_at_8.58.43_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5e7ktH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-introduces-the-news-partner-program%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F26%2F22642902%2Fapple-news-partner-program-lower-commission" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has a new offer for publishers&lt;/a&gt;: join Apple News, and it’ll only take 15 percent out of your in-app purchases and subscriptions instead of 30. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/news-partner/"&gt;Publishers can apply to Apple’s News Partner Program&lt;/a&gt; to take that bargain, but they have to agree to Apple’s requirements, which naturally benefit Apple and go beyond just maintaining a channel in Apple News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAVW3L"&gt;The list of specific eligibility requirements to apply is short but worth sharing in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="re918R"&gt;You must maintain a robust Apple News channel in Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and publish all content to that channel in Apple News Format. If you’re based outside of these regions and do not publish in Apple News Format, you must share content via an RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABvMvR"&gt;The primary function of your app must be to deliver original, professionally-authored news content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRF37b"&gt;Your app must be available on the App Store and allow users to purchase auto-renewable subscriptions through Apple’s in-app purchase system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAbIAM"&gt;The Account Holder of an Apple Developer Program membership must agree to a separate addendum to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DVrn3S"&gt;So publishers are expected to maintain their Apple News channel, publish in the Apple News Format (ANF), and offer an app in the App Store that offers auto-renewable subscriptions and only “original, professionally-authored news content.” Apple says it also wants publishers to help support and fund organizations that educate readers on news media literacy and “further efforts to diversify newsrooms and news coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BvrIdQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A dramatic reduction in fees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJq28u"&gt;It’s extra work to maintain an app and publish in an entirely separate, proprietary format, but based on what Apple reportedly asked of publishers in the past, this might be a welcome reprieve. Apple traditionally takes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12774758/apple-developers-app-store-new-subscription-rules"&gt;a 30 percent commission on in-app subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; that drops to 15 percent after a year, but before Apple News launched, rumors suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222281/apple-news-subscription-service-50-percent-cut-publishers-media-deal"&gt;Apple was asking publishers for 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, news publishers weren’t very happy about that, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21378156/apple-news-publishers-subscription-deal-app-store-cut-terms-amazon-letter"&gt;once they found out Amazon got special treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VyJQr"&gt;After the rough treatment, it’s not clear if the News Partner Program will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307242/apple-news-new-york-times-app-not-available-free-articles-subscription"&gt;entice former publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; There’s also the consideration of how this looks considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; in which Apple is currently embroiled in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;and abroad&lt;/a&gt;. But the company hasn’t exactly been one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;to consider the optics of major business shifting decisions&lt;/a&gt; as of late, so maybe it’s hoping publishers won’t either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix starts testing in-app games for users in Poland</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DF9QXeXep7VsJZo-tjRni0qNfGA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69779254/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T05eJi"&gt;Netflix is taking its next step into gaming by allowing subscribers in Poland on Android to play two &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; games inside the Netflix app, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuQo9F"&gt;“Starting today, members in Poland can try Netflix mobile gaming on Android with two games — &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 1984&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3&lt;/em&gt; — all as part of their membership,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement. “It’s still very, very early days and we will be working hard to deliver the best possible experience in the months ahead with our no ads, no in-app purchases approach to gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trgbLJ"&gt;You can see how it works &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixPL/status/1430895506427764762"&gt;in a tweet from Netflix’s Polish team&lt;/a&gt;. Available games will show up in your home feed. If you tap on a game’s icon, you can learn more about the game and tap a button to download it, which will load up the Google Play Store inside the Netflix app. From there, you can download the game, and when it’s ready, you can play it from Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="enuJYn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Let’s talk Netflix and gaming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today members in Poland can try Netflix mobile gaming on Android with two games, Stranger Things: 1984 and Stranger Things 3. It’s very, very early days and we’ve got a lot of work to do in the months ahead, but this is the first step. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r"&gt;https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcjdBd"&gt;The Netflix spokesperson clarified that games aren’t being streamed to your device — they are downloaded. And even though you are downloading the games to your device, you can only play them inside the Netflix app, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYIj85"&gt;In July, Netflix put some big stakes in the ground about its plans for gaming, hiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;a former EA and Oculus exec&lt;/a&gt; to lead the company’s gaming work and stating that its initial strategy would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;“primarily focused on games for mobile devices.”&lt;/a&gt; Games will also be included for free with users’ Netflix subscriptions — which is all setting up for the company to offer an Apple Arcade-like suite of mobile games available to Netflix subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oarEFb"&gt;This isn’t the first time Netflix has experimented with games. The streaming service offers interactive titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17460092/netflix-interactive-games-minecraft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft: Story Mode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/11/21175211/carmen-sandiego-to-steal-or-not-netflix-interactive-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego: To Steal or Not to Steal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;had several &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; projects&lt;/a&gt; in the works with Telltale, the makers of the hit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17896012/telltale-games-the-walking-dead-storytelling-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17934166/telltale-games-studio-closed-layoffs-end-the-walking-dead"&gt;before the studio collapsed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkBqjc"&gt;It’s unclear when Netflix subscribers outside of Poland or on different device platforms may be able to try the in-app mobile games. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The next generation of a feature called Scan can identify similar clothes, dog breeds, plants, cars, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9Hcci8"&gt;Snapchat’s camera has to date mostly been associated with sending disappearing messages and goofy AR effects, like a virtual dancing hot dog. But what if it did things for you, like suggest ways to make your videos look and sound better? Or show you a similar shirt based on the one you’re looking at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xUzMT"&gt;Starting Thursday, a feature called Scan is being upgraded and placed front and center in the app’s camera, letting it identify a range of things in the real world, like clothes or dog breeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRfOV2"&gt;Scan’s prominent placement in Snapchat means that the company is slowly becoming not just a messaging app, but a visual search engine. Scan also helps address a growing problem for Snapchat users: how to find the millions of AR effects, or Lenses, that are made by Snap’s creator community. With its ability to suggest Lenses based on what you’re looking at, Scan could bring more visibility to the Lenses people make, incentivizing them to keep making AR content for Snapchat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNZXg9"&gt;Visual search isn’t a new idea. In 2017, Google debuted Lens, allowing users to scan items through their phone camera and identify them using its vast index of search results. Lens is integrated in the Google Pixel phones and a number of other Android handsets, as well as baked into the main Google mobile app. Pinterest also has its own visual search feature called Lens that shows similar images based on what you scan in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gy4E3eSxayJv7yN12iupCGgLyDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805687/wreel_210825_4729_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video still by Weston Reel for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uopWY5"&gt;Even though Snap is playing catch-up, it arguably has a better shot at taking the idea of visual search mainstream. Since Snapchat opens to the camera, any change there has big implications for how its nearly 300 million daily users interact with the app. Snap says that more than 170 million people already use Scan at least once a month — that was before it was put front and center on the camera like it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NrGk8x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Long term, we see the camera doing a lot more than what it can do today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQhbwb"&gt;“We definitely think Scan will be one of the priorities for [Snapchat’s] camera going forward,” Eva Zhan, Snap’s head of camera product, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an exclusive interview. “Long term, we see the camera doing a lot more than what it can do today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvFeH4"&gt;Snap first started work on Scan a few years ago after observing how Snapchat users embraced scanning profile QR codes as a way to add friends in the app. After initially working with Shazam to identify songs and Photomath to solve math problems through its camera, Snap added the ability to identify items available for sale on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLWFu4"&gt;This latest version of Scan, which Snap previewed at its developer conference earlier this year, adds detection for dog breeds, plants, wine, cars, and food nutrition info. The majority of Scan’s features are powered by other companies; the app Vivino is behind the wine scanning feature, for example. Soon Allrecipes will power a Scan feature that suggests recipes to make based on a specific food ingredient. Snap plans to keep adding more abilities to Scan over time using a mix of outside partners and what it builds in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xI8eTx3hRjrlnjW2G1Z9vRj8a5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806109/J0773_Snap_Partner_Summit_2021_Screenshop_Scan_Press_Asset_Still_16x9_05152021_version_1120.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ywlsY3"&gt;Scan’s biggest new addition is a shopping feature that was built by Snap and aided by its recent acquisition of Screenshop, an app that lets you upload screenshots of clothing and shop for similar items. Scan can recommend similar clothes based on what you’re looking at and let you buy clothes you discover. Scan’s shopping feature will also soon be added to the camera roll section of Snapchat called Memories, letting people shop for clothes based on what they have saved from their camera or screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjgyW9"&gt;Another core pillar of Scan is what Snap calls camera shortcuts. It works by recommending a combo of a camera mode, soundtrack, and Lense. So if you point the camera at the sky, Lenses specifically designed to work with the sky will be shown alongside a song clip and color filter, letting you apply all the changes at once. According to Zhan, Snap is working to add camera shortcuts to its TikTok rival Spotlight, potentially letting the viewer of a video quickly jump into their camera with the same configuration used to create the video they just watched.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UuHLeQBr4hjVzWyVAozA75a4vog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806110/J0773_Snap_Partner_Summit_2021_Camera_Shortcuts_Scan_Press_Asset_GIF_16x9_05152021_version_1130.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iTV6cI"&gt;I found Scan’s camera shortcuts to be fun initially, but they are currently confined to only a few situations: shots of the sky, human feet, dogs, and dancing. Snap plans to expand the situations that camera shortcuts work in over time, and the integration with Spotlight shows how they could become a more integral part of the video creation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHmCFu"&gt;Snap wants Scan to be an important way that users discover AR lenses going forward. It recently started letting its AR creators tag their Lenses with relevant keywords that will help Scan suggest the right Lenses based on what the camera is observing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEULnQ-hFgWIonZmiBTnYmO-ebk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805726/wreel_210825_4729_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video still by Weston Reel for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rkDD44"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After testing Scan, I found it to be hit or miss&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0UUWzG"&gt;After testing the new Scan for the past couple of weeks, I found it to be hit or miss. There were many instances where Scan incorrectly identified things or didn’t work at all, like when it failed to recognize that there were clothes I was trying to get results for, and also times when it worked perfectly. Sometimes the suggested Lenses were relevant, and other times they were clearly not contextually recommended at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H5sjW"&gt;That said, Snap promises that Scan will get better over time, both in its ability to accurately identify things and with new categories of objects it can detect. No data from Scan is currently being used for ad targeting, but it’s easy to see how the feature could make money with more shopping or advertising tie-ins down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Anzm371v6dShjXssNLgI_z1HMns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530299/Spectacles_DonAllenIII_Portrait.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcBxkd"&gt;Scan gets more compelling in a future world with people wearing AR glasses, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;the latest Snap Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;. For me, it doesn’t feel natural to point my phone at things in the real world as a way to identify them, but the behavior makes more sense if I’m wearing smart glasses that can scan my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em1gT3"&gt;Snap already anticipates this: the new Spectacles have a dedicated Scan button on the frame that triggers Lenses based on what the wearer is viewing. (The new Spectacles aren’t available for sale. Instead Snap is giving them to select AR creators and partners who apply for access.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BkoDXm"&gt;While Scan is fairly bare-bones now, it shows how Snap is evolving the use cases for the camera. Snap sees Scan as an important part of Spectacles — and potentially other cameras — going forward, according to Zhan. “We definitely don’t want to limit Scan to just the Snapchat camera.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I Expect You To Die 2 is the most fun I’ve had solving puzzles this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The player disarming a bomb in an elevator in I Expect You To Die 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0yipJOo0hqK5IM-n2Mawgfz3TjY=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69778383/PhoenixScreenshot__3840x2160_2021_01_26_02_27_50_PM_e0f619f1b3dcd04f53d6196ee895f74d.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.schellgames.com/i-expect-you-to-die-2-press-kit#screenshots" target="_blank"&gt;Schell Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Uo3fX"&gt;You’re not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a secret agent until you put on a funny hat and fake mustache while you’re trying to stop an evil conglomerate from filling a theater with poison gas. At least, that’s what &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2&lt;/em&gt; posits, and I think it’s about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRbw8F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2: The Spy and The Liar&lt;/em&gt; is a sequel to one of the first hit virtual reality titles, which was released by Schell Games in 2016 for first-gen VR headsets. The series riffs on James Bond and other classic super spy franchises. Using motion controls and a headset, you play a field agent whose missions invariably turn into convoluted deathtraps, and you have to escape using whatever objects happen to be nearby. Behind its tongue-in-cheek tone and colorful retro stylings, it’s a master class in translating an often frustrating genre for an often frustrating piece of hardware — and it’s the most fun I’ve had solving puzzles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k2f7a8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like the original game, half the experience is watching things go wrong&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6lLzHD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2&lt;/em&gt; descends from the kinds of classic adventure games that punish tiny slip-ups with a horrible demise. Like the original, it pits you against the evil organization Zoraxis, which has a mysterious plan for (obviously) world domination. Where the original game featured almost totally standalone scenarios, the six new missions are an extended cat-and-mouse game involving an actor named John Juniper. Juniper, voiced by Wil Wheaton, gets a genuinely Bond-worthy character conceit: he prepares for roles by commissioning an elaborate mask of the person he’s embodying, then wears it continuously until his premiere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PqL5G9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgRjYVwe1Wo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwbZHx"&gt;Larger narrative aside, each mission is a puzzle box full of secret compartments and props for you to throw around with your virtual hands. You do this all without leaving your chair; when something is too far away, you can grab it telekinetically with a button on your motion controller. If you know exactly how to solve each puzzle, an &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die&lt;/em&gt; level might take a few minutes to complete. But as the name suggests, half the experience is watching things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pmzIH"&gt;Poison gas was my worst enemy in &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2&lt;/em&gt;, although I’ve also been sliced up by a sharpened pendulum, killed by a grenade in a dumbwaiter, and offed by an exploding cigar. Each failure just leaves you staring into a briefcase with a little slip of virtual paper explaining your cause of death, plus an instant restart button — so it’s not really a big deal. (You see essentially the same thing when you win a scenario, except that you get cake instead of death.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NjrXEb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Physics and motion controls can add a layer of uncertainty to the puzzles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SInhhn"&gt;I tend to find adventure games, especially VR ones, deeply maddening. When you’re already stumped trying to guess how developers want you to solve a puzzle, being stuck in a headset while you’re thinking through it is even worse than staring at a screen, and that’s hampered my enjoyment of other titles like &lt;em&gt;The Room VR&lt;/em&gt;. Additionally, in the &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die &lt;/em&gt;series, physics and motion controls add a layer of uncertainty to all your problem-solving. I got hung up on the sequel a couple of times when I was convinced I’d found the right solution but couldn’t quite maneuver it into place, before realizing that I was missing an obvious step or two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The player lighting a cigar in I Expect You To Die 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8o4KGRLfWhRRplX_EFa5Mdl_Fg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806719/PhoenixScreenshot__3840x2160_2021_01_26_02_26_48_PM_e0f619f1b3dcd04f53d6196ee895f74d.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4RRrDi"&gt;But these hangups highlight how well Schell’s overall trial-and-error setup works. &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2&lt;/em&gt; is built around quick little loops of gameplay complemented by a bunch of random silly fun, and restarting is a chance to explore more pieces of a level. Your long-suffering mission control (voiced by Jared Mason) can offer some gentle hints over the radio, but rather than spelling out solutions when you repeat a level, he cuts down his lines so you can focus. Conversely, because you spend each level in one place, every prop offers a Chekhov’s gun-like hint at a later challenge that you can feel extra clever by averting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oA2NIZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game gives you lots of ways to die, but also lots of ways to feel clever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VKzcmF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2&lt;/em&gt;’s puzzles generally have one solution, and a few parts focus a little too heavily on hitting control panel buttons in a given order. But the developers evoke the feeling that they’ve anticipated all kinds of little sequence-breaking tricks and virtual interactions, rewarding you with a visual flourish or some dialog. (The outfit mentioned above, for instance, will earn you a snarky comment from one character.) One of the sequel’s rare new features is a simple achievement system, which offers cryptic clues about its Easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AknrS"&gt;Even if you’re stuck, you’ll always have something to do in a level. And some actions overlap with the anti-frustration features. Without spoiling the encounter too much, one of my favorite moments in &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2 &lt;/em&gt;involved realizing that I did not, in fact, have to indulge a villain’s monologuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91N12b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die 2&lt;/em&gt; is only a couple of hours long, although if it follows the first game’s pattern, Schell will add a few bonus missions after release. But even at that length, it shows how solid the series’ formula is. &lt;em&gt;I Expect You To Die&lt;/em&gt; wants you to fail, but it makes failure fun — and lets players feel like they’re in on the joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMF8gE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;I Expect You To Die 2 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;was released on August 24th for the Oculus Quest, PlayStation VR, the Oculus Store, and SteamVR on PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deathloop hands-on: a mystery wrapped in a shooter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfzJp3rpRp05-10fZ4O6VSX2uC0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69778333/Deathloop_LaunchScreenshots_3840x2160_01_Julianna.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Arkane’s next game is part immersive sim, part captivating mystery&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5HxH2H"&gt;Arkane Studios is best known for its immersive sims, games like &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; that emphasize player choice to create uniquely open-ended action. The developer’s latest, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, definitely follows in that lineage. It has lots of weapons to experiment with, special powers that can change how you approach a problem, and missions where there are invariably multiple ways to proceed. The difference is that it takes that formula and mashes it together with a time-traveling mystery. It’s still a thrilling action game that forces you to make decisions. But it’s also a game where uncovering clues and following leads are as important as shooting. Sometimes, you’ll actually &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to die and start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtJ31U"&gt;I’ve been able to play through the first few hours of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m only finally starting to understand just how well those two halves can fit together — but it’s been a lot of fun to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjLPMz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the role of Colt, a man who washes up on the beach of a strange island where, he eventually learns, the residents live the same day over and over again. And most of them, like the homicidal leader Julianna, even enjoy it. Initially, you’re just trying to get your bearings. The game throws a lot at you in the beginning. Colt will see words floating around, which appear to be notes from past iterations of himself, warning of danger or highlighting specific paths. He also has Julianna yelling in his ear pretty much constantly, and she seems pretty unreliable — at least whenever she stops threatening Colt. I found myself almost overwhelmed by information at first, especially since it’s often thrown at you in the midst of a tense action set piece. Colt mirrored my feelings; he was constantly yelling and swearing when something strange happened, usually remarking how he’d rather shoot bad guys instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="deathloop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/18hgsALrGMq7I7v5ZmZ6p5LQMN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806576/Deathloop_LaunchScreenshots_3840x2160_01_Hackamajig.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82xUY4"&gt;Here’s the gist, as far as I understand it so far: Colt is stuck on an island called Blackreef, which is run by a handful of “visionaries” who experience the same day on loop. Every time Colt dies, he goes back to that same beach to start the day over again. The only thing that carries over from loop to loop are his memories, which are the key to figuring out what’s going on and breaking the loop for good. The problem, though, is that everyone else on Blackreef is pro-loop, and so will kill Colt on sight for trying to end it. I’m still unclear on the hows or the whys, but that’s the basic premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdkxUU"&gt;Central to all of this are what the game calls leads: basically, information that points you in the right direction. Colt might read a note suggesting that he’ll find an important item in a particular building that will be helpful. One of the first leads, for instance, involves finding Colt’s apartment so that he can try to figure out who he is. You can read notes lying around, messages on computers, and more to pick up new leads and hints so you know what to do next. Whenever you’re following a lead, the game will point you in the right direction with an on-screen marker. Initially, you’re following a specific path, but soon enough the game opens up so that you can choose which lead to follow at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKyihF"&gt;Complicating matters further is the fact that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;’s days are divided into four time periods and four island districts. Any time you move locations, time moves forward… and the districts are different depending on the time of day. For example, at one point I found the code for a safe, but I wasn’t actually able to use it safely until the morning, so I had to die and start the day all over again. It’s complicated, but the game does a good job of holding your hand just enough early on. I somehow never felt lost even though I had little idea of what was happening. I’m just at the stage where things are opening up, however, so that could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7VnNd"&gt;Confusion aside, what I love about &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; so far is its dedication to mystery. There are plenty of games where bits of story are hidden away in optional books and letters, that way players can choose how much they want to invest themselves in the narrative. But in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, those elements aren’t things you can miss: they’re integral to the experience. I found myself digging through every room just in case there was something helpful. Occasionally there was nothing, but I often came across useful details. And those details — whether it’s the code for a locked door or the location of an important person — often make things easier and faster the next loop you play through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="deathloop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aysrES-1r1upRkXIrnvlhHSb5nA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806579/Deathloop_LaunchScreenshots_3840x2160_01_Shift.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w5PLkb"&gt;That mystery is only made more interesting by a combination of a stylish world and extremely fun — and occasionally tense — gameplay. Blackreef is an island that feels lost to time, filled with chunky, retro-futuristic gadgets and vehicles, along with a vibe ripped right out of the 1970s. Huge pieces of strange technology loom in the background, heightening the mystery of just what this place is. The action, meanwhile, requires both experimentation and stealth. The island is absolutely teeming with people, none of whom seem to be on your side, so you can’t just go in guns blazing. (Although the gunplay &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very satisfying.) I found myself mostly sneaking around in hopes of getting stealth assassinations, but as I unlocked new items and abilities, I was able to try new approaches. There’s a hackamajig — that’s the actual name — that lets you open doors or hack turrets, sometimes making it possible to avoid combat altogether. I’ve also started unlocking special powers that do everything from give you a double jump to let you revive yourself without restarting the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TcbCZ"&gt;So far the only major issue I’ve faced has to do with how &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; handles saves. Colt uses a series of tunnels to get from location to location, and these serve as a kind of safe house where you can check over your gear, plot your next move, and save the game. Once you leave the tunnels, you’ll go to a new district and time will move forward. But out in the world, you can’t save at all, which can be frustrating when you’re following leads that are complex with lots of moving parts that can take a while to finish. It’s especially frustrating given that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is launching on the PS5, which doesn’t have a quick resume feature. I’ve mostly been putting my console in rest mode mid-mission and crossing my fingers that it doesn’t decide to turn itself off (which has happened in the past). It’s an annoying design decision in a game that otherwise feels very thoughtful, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22412758/returnal-ps5-how-to-save-debate-housemarque-update"&gt;reminiscent of the controversy&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; big PS5 game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;the sci-fi shooter &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XjET8y"&gt;From what I’ve played so far, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is a bit like if &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; was set on the island from &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;. That’s not something I ever thought I wanted, but I can’t wait to keep playing, even if it means risking losing a few loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cj8EmT"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deathloop &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches September 14th on PS5 and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TSMC is raising chip prices as supply shortages continue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvgnqWiO5XEvjBrgD26sUwCdosg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69778180/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3nem0m"&gt;TSMC is the biggest chipmaker in the world and the company responsible for the processors used by Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and even some Intel products. And its products are about to get a lot more expensive: the company plans to raise prices of its advanced chips by around 10 percent and less advanced products by about 20 percent, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-shortages-are-starting-to-hit-consumers-higher-prices-are-likely-11624276801?mod=article_inline"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8agsp"&gt;Semiconductor supply has become an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;increasingly important factor&lt;/a&gt; for major tech and automotive companies, as chips continue to be hard to come by. There are a lot of factors that go into the prices of phones, laptops, and game consoles beyond the actual bill of materials, so a 10 to 20 percent increase in processor and SOC costs may not necessarily correlate to a similar jump in price for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIEeQE"&gt;But raising the prices of what was already one of the most important and expensive components in a device (for example, two of the iPhone 12’s &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/iphone-12-bill-of-materials-revealed_id128600"&gt;three most expensive parts&lt;/a&gt; are its Qualcomm modem and A14 SOC) means that we could be headed for price increases on some of the most popular devices in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRfPOM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t specify whether Apple will be hit by TSMC’s price increases or if it will choose to pass those extra costs down to customers if it does see increased chip prices. But TSMC is quite literally the only supplier in the world capable of making chips at the advanced level and volume that Apple needs to make its A-series and M-series chips for its iPhones, Macs, and iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiC3QN"&gt;Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/apples-iphone-hot-streak-will-run-into-global-chip-shortage.html"&gt;did warn in the company’s last earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that silicon supply constraints could be coming to its upcoming iPhone and iPad products this fall, especially for older, less advanced chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bpb9xU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VSpjwZ"&gt;The good news is that the raised prices may actually help alleviate some of the supply issues for TSMC by reducing some of the demand that’s been driving the scarcity in parts. It’ll also help TSMC continue to raise money it needs for its ambitious investments in expanding capacity, which include spending $100 billion through 2023 on plans like its $12 billion manufacturing hub in Arizona and other projects. TSMC had previously warned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578361/tsmc-revenue-surge-chip-shortage-continues"&gt;shortages would likely extend into 2022&lt;/a&gt; at its latest quarterly earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s stellar 2-in-1 Chromebook Spin 713 is $200 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0EUlbLMBvb9TxNxk8SMRIC2wkQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69778176/mchin_181029_4126_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6W0SE"&gt;If you’re looking for a Chromebook that rises above many other models in terms of build quality, features, and performance, you should check out Best Buy’s deal on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713. It normally costs $629 to get the model that has a respectable Intel Core i5-10210U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750178633960709533" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but it’s $200 off that price today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s yours for $429. At this price, the Spin 713 is kind of in a league of its own, with a convenient 2-in-1 design, a 2K resolution display with the ideal 3:2 aspect ratio, and long-lasting battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6f8yt"&gt;Acer recently launched a 2021 version of the Spin 713 and it features an improved 11th Gen Intel processor and Thunderbolt 4 support, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but my colleague Monica Chin found&lt;/a&gt; that it had slightly worse battery life than the model that’s discounted today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dlzKCH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10719944"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iBBpqt"&gt;Many modern TVs feature better speakers than they did a decade ago, however, built-in speakers aren’t likely to hold a candle to a dedicated soundbar anytime soon. And if you’re looking to upgrade your TV’s sound without spending a fortune on something like Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623242/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-xbox-series-x-ps5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HT-A7000&lt;/a&gt;, the Sonos Beam is a great way to go. The well-designed, Alexa-enabled speaker is simple to set up and simple to use, and offers good sound for its size, whether you plan on watching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400212/cruella-review-disney-plus-emma-stone-101-dalmatians" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it hits Disney Plus or kicking out the latest tunes from the Weeknd. Normally $400, the white Sonos Beam is on sale right now at the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsonos-beam%2F8VF2Z4SLTXCL%2F241L%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store for $349&lt;/a&gt;, a rare $50 discount. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aAYXE1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f01OwM"&gt;In case you weren’t aware, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639523/oculus-quest-2-pause-sale-recall-base-model-storage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus rereleased its Quest 2 headset&lt;/a&gt; this week with double the amount of storage (128GB compared to 64GB previously) in the base configuration for the same $299 price. To people who already own the Quest 2, this is the opposite of a deal. It’s treachery. But, hey, if you’ve held off on buying one until now, your patience is being rewarded big time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Lcvwb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sAxPI6"&gt;Whether you live in a region where the air quality isn’t currently at its best, or you suffer from allergies year-round, Coway’s Mighty Air Purifier might be what you need to get some relief. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fnco%2FBundle-Coway-Airmega-AP-1512HH-Mighty-Air-Purifier-Replacement-Filter%2F827483065&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This model is cheaper than usual at Walmart, costing $190&lt;/a&gt; instead of around $230, plus it comes with a replacement filter pack, which is a nice bonus. At &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coway-AP-1512HH-Mighty-Purifier-True/dp/B00BTKAPUU?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, it costs $200 currently and doesn’t include an extra set of filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KhjHiP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10719965"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>On TikTok, LGBTQ creators push back against sponsors who just want their identity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eoPDBkXWRLCFq-VPGrbDGcg24Yc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69778029/VRG_ILLO_4687_LGBTQ_TikTok_2.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Claudia Chinyere Akole&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a lucrative opportunity many don’t want to take&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hGxkDb"&gt;A few times per month, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/07/07/lifestyle/how-anania-williams-blew-up-tiktok-became-gen-z-comedy-star/"&gt;Anania Williams&lt;/a&gt; posts sponsored content to his TikTok account, sandwiched in between memes, social commentary, and amateur drag videos. The sponsorships offer financial security, alleviating “a lot of the pressure of coming from a poorer family” by helping him pay for rent and school in Boston, Williams said. This past July, he was able to quit his summer job, turning TikTok into his primary money-making gig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmQYcg"&gt;But more and more, Williams — like other creators from the LGBTQ community — has found himself being asked by advertisers to feature his identity in these sponsored posts, something he isn’t comfortable doing. That’s put these creators in a tough spot: they can either push back and risk a sponsorship, or get paid for something they’d often rather not commercialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3Mp0wG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creators are profoundly ambivalent about turning their own selfhood into a product&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ux06K6"&gt;“I was struggling for a long time, but I’m really grateful for what I do have now where I can at least sustain myself,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvxIfo"&gt;Brand partnerships have become commonplace on TikTok, even for influencers with much smaller reaches than, say, the D’Amelio sisters. But smaller creators don’t always have the option to be choosy about what sponsorships they do and don’t take, making it difficult for creators when advertisers push for an idea they don’t like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhWHle"&gt;This problem became particularly acute for LGBTQ creators in June, when many brands wanted to contract with influencers for Pride Month and TikTok users began expressing skepticism of “corporate pride” en masse. Five TikTok influencers who spoke with me, all members of the LGBTQ community, said they were profoundly ambivalent about the way that sponsored content can end up turning their own selfhood into a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GezolO"&gt;Smaller LGBTQ influencers are sometimes choosing to be picky about the ways in which they choose to do sponsored content — even at risk of their own livelihood. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@meiyarose?lang=en"&gt;Meiya Sparks Lin&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a 311,000-follower channel where they post a mix of makeup tutorials, jokes, and political musings, turned down one deal for pride content, they said, because “there’s been a lot of discussion about commodification of pride, and I don’t think this would go over very well with either me or my audience.” Automotive influencer &lt;a href="https://mechanicshopfemme.com/"&gt;Chaya Milchtein&lt;/a&gt;, who writes and makes videos about (among other things) her identities as a queer fat woman in the automotive industry, says that she turned down several brand deals because “they looked at me like I was sort of a zebra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EDRC9N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The issue comes when it’s very disingenuous, and it’s often very clear when that is”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kQgNIA"&gt; Choosing the wrong sponsorship can also blow back on creators. TikTok comedian and podcaster &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@generationshallow?lang=en"&gt;Andrew Sciallo&lt;/a&gt; promoted a dating app that matches people based on astrological compatibility, for example, which his audience saw as disingenuous. “It felt a bit hypocritical,” he laughed, because all of his content is focused on encouraging gay men to stop using apps such as Grindr and instead make face-to-face connections with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLeLMo"&gt;On the flip side, there can be decent money in sponsorships on LGBTQ topics — if you get the right deal. For LGBTQ and mental health educator &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zoestoller?lang=en&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;Zoe Stoller&lt;/a&gt;, this past June was the most profitable month of their career thus far. She created content promoting HBO Max’s line of shows with LGBTQ characters, and works as a “TikTok educator” with the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvTB1A"&gt;“I think it’s wonderful that brands have made it a common thing to dedicate their pages to celebrating Pride Month, or at least making a post, or changing their logos,” Stoller said. “The issue comes when it’s very disingenuous, and it’s often very clear when that is. You know, when a company just changes their logo to rainbow, but doesn’t have any LGBTQ creators sharing things on their page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzYbFY"&gt;The other issue, Stoller says, is when companies don’t offer to pay LGBTQ creators for their work. “And a lot of companies unfortunately do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp226p"&gt;Lin says that there’s some hope: as someone with access to an audience that brands suddenly very much desire, they can make some of their own demands on how they’ll be represented in a way that, say, actors in previous forms of ad campaigns would not have been able to do. In Lin’s case, they were able to produce other types of content entirely rather than directly engaging with pride-branded videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fmFDpF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creators have to be wary of companies that aren’t “really there to share our stories”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gkcPmk"&gt;Contracts with brands often prohibit influencers from being part of unions. So, any power creators have to organize — withholding sponsorship contracts from brands that don’t support LGBTQ rights, for example — comes by word of mouth, in Discord groups and Clubhouse chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdXMIg"&gt;“A lot of influencers, especially on TikTok because it’s such a new genre of work, will undersell themselves,” Lin said. Sciallo said creators have to be wary of companies that are “not really there to share our stories, they’re there to exploit us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IBhIk"&gt;For Williams and Lin, though, there’s no easy answer on navigating sponsorships as they pay for college by putting themselves out there online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRJ3Ua"&gt;“I don’t know if there’s something I can do to ... change the tide of gay equals money,” Williams said. “But if there’s something I can do, I’m going to do my best to do that.” But for now, on TikTok, LGBTQ does equal a powerful consumer base, and brands are aware of that fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="O1nsDJ"&gt;“I don’t think queer liberation or the liberation of any marginalized peoples can ever really come through, you know, consumer power,” Lin said. “So I think as long as you’re not marketing liberation as a brand, you can do what you want.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jlw5Ts"&gt;Slap bang in the middle of a Venn diagram with two circles labelled “sincere tech startups” and “dystopian satires that are a little on the nose” you will find &lt;a href="https://squareat.com/"&gt;SquarEat&lt;/a&gt;: a company that you would swear is a joke if you weren’t already familiar with how the simulation we’re all living in likes to collide fact and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJEsxs"&gt;SquarEat was apparently born of a simple idea: what if you could eat squares? But boy oh boy does it deliver on that premise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GfRR7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SquarEat says it’s “created a new concept of food” (squares)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lchbPQ"&gt;The company claims to have “created a new concept of food” (squares) which it makes by blitzing ingredients and compressing them into “ready-to-eat” 50 gram packages (squares). You can buy your squares in packs of four or six and have them delivered to your house. They can be eaten hot or cold, heated in a microwave or a frying pan, and come in a &lt;a href="https://squareat.com/squares"&gt;dazzling array of flavors&lt;/a&gt; including chicken, beef, asparagus, peanut, seabass, and salmon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeQOZA"&gt;The Miami-based startup seems to have launched in June, and, honestly, I’m still not totally sure it’s not satire. When images of its products started doing the rounds on Twitter this week most people were similarly confused, with its square meals drawing comparisons to dystopian TV shows and films like &lt;em&gt;Snowpiercer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Soylent Green&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="uAHJeS"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/food/what-squareat-modular-squared-food-company-taking-over-twitter-t229104"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though, SquarEat’s chief marketing officer Laura Vacaflores assures the publication that square food is both real and tragically misunderstood. Vacaflores said the square shape of the foods helps standardize preparation and packaging, and that a single square isn’t supposed to be a full meal replacement. The squares are intended to be eaten as multiple units (my favorite way to measure meal intake) and can be combined with other non-square nutrient forms, aka regular food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NoJ13J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not the first food concept that adopted the square shape, if you, for example, think about tofu”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0XlCj"&gt;“Thanks to the square shape, we are able to run mass production using gourmet techniques […] Allowing us to produce a superior-quality food and sell it at an affordable price,” Vacaflores told &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;. “We are not the first food concept that adopted the square shape, if you, for example, think about tofu. The only thing we are asking people to leave behind is their original idea about the external appearance of the food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocexfz"&gt;Vacaflores added that each square is seasoned ready to go and uses proper ingredients. “There’s no substitute at all [...] For example, the chicken is just chicken breast, black pepper, lemon and rosemary,” she told &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;. “It has nothing weird, no additives. I know a lot of people think this is a meal replacement, but it’s not, it’s just chicken. People try it and say, ‘Wow, it tastes just like chicken,’ and yes, because it is chicken. There’s nothing else.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The squares come in a variety of flavors, both sweet and savory, each 50 grams in size. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZsekdyijRFqFjz0yT4L5OOF3MQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22806553/Screen_Shot_2021_08_26_at_1.00.49_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The square shape is supposed to help standardize packaging and production&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wam1xy"&gt;While SquarEat doesn’t seem to be an elaborate joke, it’s also very much a startup that, I would wager, is not yet manufacturing its squares at anything near industrial scale. The company is currently &lt;a href="https://wefunder.com/squareat"&gt;raising money on WeFunder&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s pitching an extremely ambitious plan to “disrupt the food delivery market” by replacing meal plan programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1cjwF"&gt;Honestly, I’m not sure what to think about SquarEat. It strikes me as an unnecessary and dispiriting way to eat food, but that doesn’t mean it won’t be a success. Meal replacement shake companies like Soylent and Huel are still with us after all, and leaning into the dystopian imagery inherent in their product didn’t seem to hurt them in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Krzdbw"&gt;More than that, I now have a genuine urge to find out what these squares taste like. Their little Lego forms are now embedded firmly in my imagination, and I must know what it feels like to bite into a square chicken. Maybe for lunch today I’ll make a square meal of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
