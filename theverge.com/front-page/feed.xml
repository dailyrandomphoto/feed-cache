    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Design Lab returns for Xbox Series X custom controllers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06FGi3cDUdKmmV4vE64ZHCVeVA4=/156x0:1277x747/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467839/xboxdesignlab.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LzpRjC"&gt;Microsoft is bringing its Xbox Design Lab back for Xbox Series X controllers. Originally launched in 2016, Xbox Design Lab allows Xbox owners to create personalized Xbox controllers. Microsoft is bringing the program back for the next-gen Xbox Series X controllers, after putting it on hold just ahead of the Series X launch last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiBeAC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2FXboxDesignLab&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22531865%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Custom controllers will be available&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, and most European countries today, priced at $69.99 with millions of color combinations. Just like before, you can customize colors in pretty much every part of the controller, including bumpers, thumb sticks, the D-pad, and options for buttons. Engraving is also available for an extra $9.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU9rEq"&gt;All new Xbox Design Lab controllers will be based on the Xbox Series X / S controllers, which have fairly minor tweaks over the original Xbox One controller. Microsoft has reshaped its latest controllers to fit a “wider range of people,” and the latest Xbox controller also includes a redesigned D-pad and a dedicated share button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBmOuP"&gt;Unfortunately, you still can’t create a custom Xbox Elite controller. Microsoft’s Xbox Design Lab is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2FXboxDesignLab&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22531865%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-design-lab-series-x-colors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available today here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from the 2021 fire season in the West</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COCHISE STRONGHOLD, ARIZONA - APRIL 18: A recent forest fire burned out a campground, April 18, 2021, in the Dragoon Mountains of Eastern Arizona.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lk7cnJvGrhWWu7oufi_coSQ_Q7U=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467755/1316479844.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The stage is set for a bad season, but there are still a lot of unknowns&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="iMhCtD"&gt;After a horrific 2020 fire season, the 2021 season is heating up. Ominous signs popped up early this year: a worsening drought and early heatwaves. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with fire, weather, and climate experts to break down what to expect throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ocAsQ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How bad is 2021’s fire season going to get?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lumn6B"&gt;The stage is already set for a pretty bad fire season. Up to 9.5 million acres could burn this year, according to a fire season &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/severe-weather/accuweather-2021-us-wildfire-season-forecast/939026"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; from AccuWeather. That’s 140 percent of the 10-year average. It’s not as much as last year, when more than 10 million acres were scorched. That was the second worst year for fires in the US, in terms of acres burned, &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf"&gt;since 1960&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVl8OE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The potential for “significant fire activity” is “above normal” for pretty much all of the West &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CUqbv"&gt;The potential for “significant fire activity” is “above normal” for pretty much all of the West at some point this year, according to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"&gt;outlook&lt;/a&gt; from the National Interagency Fire Center. A “significant fire” is one that grows so large that locals usually need to call in help from outside the region, according to Nick Nauslar, a fire meteorologist at the Bureau of Land Management. The blaze might span thousands of acres and require hundreds or thousands of personnel to battle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EA6HY9"&gt;But predicting just how bad things will get is still a tough question, so it’s best to break it down into two parts that could influence how this fire season unfolds: known risk factors and wildcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grp25T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, so what are the risk factors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tqr2CX"&gt;A major risk factor is drought. The Western US is in the middle of the most widespread and intense drought in decades. More than &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;83 percent of the West is in a drought&lt;/a&gt;; about half is experiencing “extreme” or “exceptional drought.” In fact, the water level at the Hoover Dam reservoir, the largest in the US, hit a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;historic low&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYxAVD"&gt;“This is currently the most exceptional drought that we’ve ever shown on the map in the Western US,” says Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who creates maps for the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. “When we see droughts like this, it really amplifies the fire season.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-ENVIRONMENT-DROUGHT" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/byP8ub4kys1FdVTC7i7LPcTSNeM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665088/1233384349.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Bridget Bennett / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A growing pale high-water mark known as a “bathtub ring” is seen on the shoreline of Lake Mead at the Hoover Dam near Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 10th, 2021, where the water level has fallen to its lowest since the reservoir was filled in the 1930s. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LbpCpG"&gt;Plants are parched, making them excellent fuel for wildfires. Spring was so hot and dry in California that San Jose State University researchers were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FireWeatherLab/status/1378184587315085313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1378184587315085313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2021%2F04%2F15%2Fweather%2Fcalifornia-wildfire-season-forecast%2Findex.html"&gt;shocked&lt;/a&gt; in April to find no new growth of the Chamise plant, which they track to monitor moisture content in vegetation. Now, the plants are drying out faster than they normally do, with their moisture content just shy of reaching a record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXKQOq"&gt;The lower the moisture content, the easier it is for vegetation to catch fire. In that situation, “If somebody drops a match or cigarette, you know, we’re hosed,” says Craig Clements, a professor and director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San Jose State University. Moisture content is closely tied to a fire’s spread rate, or how fast the blaze moves forward. So when that fuel is critically dry, Clements says, fires can get much bigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2A3VHZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the wildcards?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hqIj6a"&gt;The biggest wildcard is the weather. As of June 1st, there had been fewer acres burned this year than the 10-year average. That’s mostly because there hadn’t been “critical fire weather patterns,” which can be different combinations of high temperatures, strong winds, aridity, and lightning. In 2020, California got an unusual combination of lots of lightning with little rain. That sparked some of the state’s worst blazes, which were fanned by strong gales. California wound up doubling its record for acres burned that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ewj5z7QEP7Gldv_NyBQa9GTO-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21867291/PANO0003-3.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearby wildfires blanketed San Francisco with smoke and turned skies orange during the 2020 fire season. Verge video director Vjeran Pavic took these pictures of San Francisco and Sutro Tower using a drone on September 9th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fFtNSm"&gt;“If we transported us back to early to mid-June 2020, we probably have more potential this year than we did last year,” says Nauslar. “The potential is there, but now it’s a matter of if the weather will line up to realize that potential or not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9edXHk"&gt;Another unknown is people’s behaviors. Do they take extra precautions? Or might they plan an elaborate &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/us/gender-reveal-party-wildfire.html"&gt;baby gender reveal that sparks a blaze&lt;/a&gt;? “As a resident in a high fire hazard area myself, and as someone who understands how quickly these fires can grow and put people in harm’s way, I definitely look at this upcoming season and say, ‘Okay, we’ve got to be vigilant,” says Crystal Kolden, a former firefighter who is now an assistant professor of fire science at the School of Engineering at the University of California, Merced. “We just have to keep reminding people that if there aren’t any human ignitions, then we don’t have any really big fires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7iWXdh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another unknown is people’s behaviors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u83uWQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How’s fire season going so far? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eSuswY"&gt;A scorching heatwave and high winds this week have fed what’s become the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/558859-one-of-arizonas-largest-wildfires-in-history"&gt;sixth-largest &lt;/a&gt;fire in Arizona’s history. Officials listed the cause of the Telegraph Fire burning outside of Phoenix as “&lt;a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7512/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;,” but the cause is still under investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xaqw4G"&gt;Most Western states have already had at least one significant fire this year, according to AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter. “So the season has run ahead of usual, if you will, in that regard,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TcTCr"&gt;Bad weather is starting to make things worse. Hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/17/heat-wave-southwest-fires-drought/"&gt;temperature records fell&lt;/a&gt; this week during a sweltering spring heatwave. Salt Lake City, Utah, reached a record &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSSaltLakeCity/status/1404949205588742146"&gt;107 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit on June 15th. The temperature in Billings, Montana, climbed up to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSBillings/status/1405040165760868352"&gt;108 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Fahrenheit that day, tying its record. And Texas residents face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;power shortages&lt;/a&gt; as they sweat out the heatwave, just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456856/deaths-undercount-texas-freeze-power-outage"&gt;deadly blackouts&lt;/a&gt; during a freak cold snap earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nNIchI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does fire season last? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DmkXSh"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445539/2021-atlantic-hurricane-season-noaa-forecast"&gt;Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;, the fire season in the Western US doesn’t start and end on the same day every year. Unofficially, it’s been thought of as beginning in late spring and lasting through early fall, roughly May to November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz11WZ"&gt;The season hits its peak at different times in different regions. The Southwest typically sees peak fire potential earlier in the season, and then areas further north and west follow. Part of that has to do with what type of vegetation, or fuel, is in each region. Grass tends to dry out faster and then burn earlier. California’s shrubby chaparral takes a little longer to dry out and forests even longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4N735e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10611720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RzsoBq"&gt;Fire season is growing longer, &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2315/study-fire-seasons-getting-longer-more-frequent/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows, thanks to changing rainfall and snowmelt patterns. Fire season has lengthened by 75 agonizing days across the Sierras, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqHr5G"&gt;“[Fire season] used to kind of have a better definition,” Nauslar says. “But now I think we’ve been more talking about ‘fire year.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xHTAjw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Climate change is going to throw some really nasty curveballs at us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1weCgl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is climate change playing a role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rBC6p1"&gt;The “season” is expected to keep growing longer and more intense as the planet heats up.  That’s because climate change is exacerbating many of the risk factors that drive wildfires. Heatwaves are getting more frequent and intense. Typical droughts are becoming megadroughts. Lightning strikes &lt;a href="https://environmentjournal.online/articles/the-future-is-not-forecast-how-lightning-is-affected-by-climate-change/"&gt;could even become more common&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/6/"&gt;By 2060&lt;/a&gt;, the amount of land lit up by lightning-ignited fires could be 130 percent of what it was in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JQUuo3"&gt;“Part of me looks at the upcoming season and says, you know, climate change is going to throw some really nasty curveballs at us, every single year,” Kolden says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzAXKi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9X1WU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 will be available through Sony’s store later today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xS5CiNMvEijE7WtcR5T9S8X8bM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467646/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ww7DNc"&gt;More than six months after its initial debut, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; remains as elusive as ever. Sony also expects console shortages to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;stretch into 2022&lt;/a&gt;, however, as of 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT, both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition will be available at Sony’s store. &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=hsm0u2oyux&amp;amp;ver=v3-javascript-3.6.3&amp;amp;cver=281&amp;amp;man=PS%20Direct%20Prod%20KU%20Action&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fhardware%2Fps5&amp;amp;kupver=akamai-1.0.2"&gt;You can head to that site right now&lt;/a&gt;, and the page will automatically toss you into the queue to (hopefully) secure a PS5 from the batch being released into the wild today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcPHQX"&gt;Sony says that you don’t need to refresh the page, but make sure that you stick around once the queue begins because it’ll likely ask you at some point to verify that you’re still present, or else you might be booted from the queue. If it’s your first time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;welcome to the needless drama involved with buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVpQBa"&gt;So, what’s the difference between the two models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA6hbH"&gt;The standard PS5 ($499.99) and the Digital Edition ($399.99) are nearly identical, aside from the obvious. The standard console features a UHD Blu-ray disc drive whereas the latter does not, meaning you’ll need to download or stream anything you want to watch or play. The Digital Edition also features a slimmer, lighter build because of this, however, keep in that the size difference is slight. Both consoles also sport an 825GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0F29IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7hBTYW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zFuNf"&gt;If you do manage to purchase a PS5, there are a few games and additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550907/ps5-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories-sony"&gt;accessories we suggest you pick up&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736382577329371434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D Headset&lt;/a&gt;, the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WL86N5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;midnight black DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, and the best PS5 exclusive released thus far: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Returnal-PlayStation-5/dp/B08QFPS48J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AasZjK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JTGN3h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nefQI6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;In addition to the accessories above, we also recommend buying an &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so gives you access to online multiplayer, a selection of free monthly titles, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to play a host of PlayStation 4 classics on your PS5 at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Crg6Jf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Rfz4Sb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gk4v7b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N4rM16"&gt;During a normal week, Leiti Hsu dedicates at least one night to hosting her Dream Dinner Party. She hops on Clubhouse to interview guests, describing the food and atmosphere of her fictitious party as a gateway into deep, emotional conversations. Wagyu steak sizzles in front of you, she calls out, a massage table and masseuse sit on call for anyone who wants to take some time away from the (imaginary) table, she reminds you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAAudB"&gt;But last week, Hsu showed us what her Clubhouse room looks like when brought into the real world. Packed inside a New York City apartment, Hsu has brought in an actual masseuse, Tony Qin, to rub people down. A chef stands behind an island prepping “roving omakase,” like octopus salad and spicy tuna onigiri, along with various a la minute dishes. Tom Shpetner, aka Tom the Somm, aka the night’s sommelier, walks around pouring drinks. This party’s his first time back working the room, schmoozing with guests, and gushing about wine since the pandemic shut everything down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMoNsM"&gt;Lisa Ann Markuson, a poet at Ars Poetica, is also available to write poetry on-demand, typed on a typewriter, for guests. “Poems on a cloud,” Markuson says, as she sits on a white fluffy cushion. She writes me a post-pandemic poem about coming out the other end of it: “nourished, healed, no need to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfLZtPl2d2YH7MSxe7iN-hA1jvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663110/akrales_20210607_4616_0046.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host Leiti Hsu welcomed guests into the apartment and encouraged them to, instead of their names, write down their go-to, after-school snack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PWr-ZgV7j27D0n5LGRV6dnJr94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663118/akrales_20210607_4616_0294.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although the event wasn’t broadcast on Clubhouse, partygoers still captured moments they could share online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1mY9_nIbQOAVEHNDN_Yq0Svx4Fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665138/akrales_20210607_4616_0253.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xvOxPa"&gt;This event could represent Clubhouse’s worst-case scenario: why would anyone tune in to an app when they could join in person and eat eggplant katsu with a bunch of cool, creative people? There’s already speculation that fewer users are logging in to Clubhouse regularly, and multiple people at the party tell me this is true — they’ve seen their room numbers drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6vjzO"&gt;The app’s future seems to be on everyone’s mind. Without prompting, one person launches into a defense of Clubhouse without me ever even asking about its problems. Another person tells me that “navel-gazing” about the platform’s future and how it’s doing is a “boring question,” which, interpret that as you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2vm19"&gt;Hsu isn’t the first creator to make her Clubhouse rooms happen in person. Nicole Behnam of the Beyond club has hosted events in person in Los Angeles, while the Lullaby Club, a club with more than 45,000 followers, hosted its first in-person event in New York City in June. (Axel Mansoor, formerly the Clubhouse app icon and founder of the Lullaby Club is even in attendance at this party.) All these events clearly owe their attention and existence to Clubhouse, but the move to in person suggests a shift of sorts, away from the digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjPBMa"&gt;Whether the actual app numbers are waning or not, though, everyone here loves Clubhouse, if only for a chance to meet and get to know new people. The party comes off more like a reunion. The attendees had clearly already chatted, sang together, and shared their secrets on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah5acp"&gt;“It was just like, ‘Yep, I know who you are. You’re that same, silly person that I saw online,’” says an attendee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3wjhC"&gt;The broader group tends to attribute this comfort to having heard each other’s voices first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JKXP7"&gt;“If I met you on Clubhouse, and we had a heart-to-heart, or even if you heard me and I heard you, I’d remember your voice,” Kunal Sood, a Clubhouse creator with more than 35,000 followers tells me. “I feel like that’s what the app does, it gives you a feeling of wanting to be intimately connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZbjqnUFSEbXe889q9ruqN2-q8Sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663114/akrales_20210607_4616_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guests embraced often, making the event feel more like a reunion than a gathering of people meeting for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FswBZvPwGIcVYTuQWOXvaq-6Kcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665111/akrales_20210607_4616_0139.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S9RxPeDskXPaJmd7ixwFkI0Gb08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663112/akrales_20210607_4616_0097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masseuse Tony Qin offered massages to party guests along with a blanket to cover up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nW5Thr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASB1AQ"&gt;And now they could actually, physically connect. Most of the attendees seem to consider themselves &lt;em&gt;huggers&lt;/em&gt;, often going in for a hug, even with me, instead of a handshake. Everyone is constantly embracing and touching each other, putting their arms around one another’s shoulders, resting their heads on others’ shoulders. Contact all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Udmcd7"&gt;“I don’t like shaking hands now,” one attendee and Clubhouse user tells me. “I’ve been hugging people instead now.” “We’re all so touchy-feely,” another person says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l9InM"&gt;Instead of name tags, guests write their after-school snack of choice down on a sticker. Mine — mac and cheese — became my identifier and also my “safe word,” Hsu says, though I’m still not entirely clear where or when I’m supposed to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7dsjB"&gt;Hsu reminds us of this rule after three hours of partying when everyone is instructed to take a seat on the floor around the DJ booth and some microphones. Guests sing, thanks to the presence of the Lullaby Club, and Hsu auctions off a coffee date with the Knicks’ physical therapist, who is at the party, as well as the founder of the period activist group Period.org. The date sells for $400, which Hsu says she’ll donate, along with ticket proceeds from the event, to the nonprofit Food for Soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS078h"&gt;But controlling an in-person crowd isn’t as easy as wrangling a group on the app. Hsu attempts to quiet everyone down, as do multiple party guests who take the mic, but they can’t stop everyone from talking and eating in their small groups. It’s a party, and there’s no mute button IRL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3UP9N"&gt;Hosting in an apartment comes with its own complications, too. Hsu needed to find a physical space, food to dish out, and, broadly, be an attentive party host who wants people to enjoy their time while also not forcing them to quiet down and stop talking, which likely won’t go over in a room of talkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRN_uKjNQaSaYg8Ucf9xyPQHORY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665136/akrales_20210607_4616_0155.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Btn-oalA2hGK0sRRtYzTHqp9SC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665135/akrales_20210607_4616_0050.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/smvfYinyNpZrmfdQU8GSRbdOwzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663113/akrales_20210607_4616_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chef prepared various “roving omakase” dishes, including eggplant katsu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ir1w"&gt;“What I have been astonished by is just speaking things into existence, and on Clubhouse, you can do it to like hundreds or thousands of people,” Hsu says. “In real life, it takes a little bit of a different kind of effort to get 50 people in a room, but no matter what, it’s always speaking things into existence and [getting] the right people here, and their magic unfolds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egYgLg"&gt;Strangely, I consistently get the sense that these people — big Clubhouse users who are used to talking for hours on end — are panicking about what they say to me during this event, even though it’s never incriminating or even all that spicy. Someone tells me the app “changed their life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWJR5wVTGojlpzm4Ems7CSNB_1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663109/akrales_20210607_4616_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Ann Markuson of Ars Poetica sits on a “cloud,” aka a very soft, feathery pillow to type poems on-demand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zNEOwe"&gt;Two Clubhouse creators, who seemingly pride themselves on honest, real, authentic conversation, worried after the event that I might quote them or actually print what they said, which suggested to me that they perhaps feel safer on the app, where conversations disappear, people aren’t supposed to record, and they control the space, despite much of this being true of the real world, too. Still, at this party, what you say might be remembered, repeated, or, if you’re standing in the presence of a journalist, written down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ig7yFo"&gt;They’re intensely loyal to the platform, though, with only some willing to admit to seeing cracks in Clubhouse’s buzzy facade. One person proudly tells me they haven’t logged in to Clubhouse in four months, but they believe if the app can make it through 2021, it’ll be here to stay. Another tells me multiple other platforms have reached out about signing exclusive deals, although they’re loyal to Clubhouse for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyOLsQ"&gt;The following day, two creators message me to point out that Clubhouse numbers are popping off, and sure enough, they are. Rooms are reaching thousands of listeners, a rarity recently. The numbers recalibrate to the usual, lower reach the next day, but none of these people who’ve seen the numbers drop, or have even cut back on their time, seem worried. Clubhouse gave them a platform and place to connect with people. It’s not going anywhere for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qj3Oob"&gt;As I listen to the live auction, I decide to head over to the massage table. Lying face down, I listen to guests name who they’d want at their dream dinner party, like Glenn Close, Issa Rae, and someone’s grandpa. I slightly drift off with the sound of the partygoers chatting in the background, similar to how I have in the app itself. But when my massage ends, and I realize it’s already nearly 11PM with a subway ride ahead of me, I can’t just close the app and immediately fall asleep. I instead make the rounds, saying goodbye to people I met, exchanging info and phone numbers. Maybe we’d meet up for drinks sometime soon, we say. But more likely, I’d catch them on the app, maybe raise my hand as a little hello, and then log off and go back to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thsCPu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3AT9F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Peter Jackson-directed documentary about The Beatles will debut on Disney Plus in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvmBV3EUogzyaBsdcfsCBK32Yhg=/0x9:1192x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467398/beatles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UocEGvQ10OE&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheBeatles" target="_blank"&gt;The Beatles/Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HxXHdq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about the iconic band directed by Peter Jackson, &lt;a href="https://www.thebeatles.com/news/%E2%80%9C-beatles-get-back%E2%80%9D-disney-original-documentary-series-directed-peter-jackson-debut-exclusively"&gt;will debut as a three-part series&lt;/a&gt; on Disney Plus over the Thanksgiving holiday later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cQiqN"&gt;Jackson spent three years restoring and editing some 60 hours of footage shot in January 1969 by &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512327/bio"&gt;Michael Lindsay-Hogg&lt;/a&gt; that hasn’t been seen before, and more than 150 hours of previously unheard audio. It captures John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr preparing for their first live show in more than two years, writing and rehearsing 14 new songs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H187vp"&gt;The documentary also includes the band’s famous rooftop concert on Savile Row in London— you’ve probably &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F346026991&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538527%2Fbeatles-documentary-peter-jackson-directed-disney-plus-november" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen parts of it&lt;/a&gt; — a show that ended up being The Beatles’ final public performance. The film also includes songs that later were released on &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt;, two of the band’s final albums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UOlKhq"&gt;Jackson, perhaps best known as the director of the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, said the documentary wasn’t merely nostalgia, “it’s raw, honest, and human,” he said in a statement. “Over six hours, you’ll get to know The Beatles with an intimacy that you never thought possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j42i6O"&gt;The project has the full support of the two living Beatles McCartney and Starr, Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono and Harrison’s widow Olivia. &lt;em&gt;Get Back &lt;/em&gt;was originally scheduled for a September 2020 release, then bumped to September 2021 before finally being scheduled for&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1092198/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; this Thanksgiving.

    <title>Amazon’s Halo body fat percentage calculator outperforms lab devices  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Halo’s body scanning feature, which calculates body fat percentage." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hp2INOzSvHif8YuZCJPXw6Ttu9k=/1x0:2500x1666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467324/Halo_App_Body_Feature.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aPXzKy"&gt;Amazon’s body fat percentage scanner performs better than other, more cumbersome methods of calculating body fat, a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.21258595v1.full.pdf"&gt;new study showed&lt;/a&gt;. A body scan is one feature on the Amazon Halo Band subscription service, which the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;last August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4UnPx"&gt;The Halo Body feature works through smartphone cameras. Users take four photos of their bodies, which are then combined into a 3D image. Then, Amazon’s tool uses machine learning to calculate the user’s body fat percentage. When Amazon launched Halo, the company said it did an internal study to validate the feature. Now, they’ve released a study — which was funded by Amazon, but conducted with leading experts in the field — showing that the tool works well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeVa0P"&gt;The results show that the tool could be a benchmark for people looking to get more information about their bodies, says Diana Thomas, a mathematician who studies body weight regulation at West Point and was not involved in the study. She wouldn’t use it for scientific research, but it could give users another data point. “It gives you more information,” she says. “If you have a high percent body fat flagged by this, it could be a red flag for you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdIOhT"&gt;Body fat percentage can be a more accurate way to assess someone’s health than their weight. Two people at the same size could have different amounts of fat relative to their overall weight and would have different health risks as a result. Having some body fat is important, but having a high percentage is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/healthy-body-fat-percentage"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt; like heart conditions and diabetes. The percentage of body fat considered healthy &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/body-fat-percentage"&gt;varies&lt;/a&gt; for people of different ages and sexes. Women, for example, have more body fat than men.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhvrKR"&gt;The study used data collected at two sites: Massachusetts General Hospital and Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. It had 134 participants of varying body types and included 82 women and 52 men. Of the group, 81 were Caucasian, 32 were Black, nine were Asian, four were Hispanic, one was American Indian, and seven were multiracial. It’s a small number of people, but that’s typical with this type of research, which has to run people through expensive and unwieldy tests, Thomas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4MPuG"&gt;Each person in the study had their body fat percentage calculated through an X-ray technique that shows fat distribution through the body called dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is the gold standard. The results from those scans were compared to the Amazon system, five scales that calculate body fat (two professional and three consumer), and something called air displacement plethysmography — which uses a pod-shaped device that measures how someone’s body displaces the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RWtxJq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This showed [Halo Body] is more accurate than the burdensome thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neStJB"&gt;The study found that the body fat percentages calculated by Amazon Halo Body were closest to those calculated by DXA. It performed better than the air displacement plethysmography device, which is often used to calculate body fat by people studying weight and body composition, but is cumbersome and tricky to conduct correctly. The pods are expensive, have to be housed in a lab, and require people to wear swim caps and tight-fighting clothing. “This showed [Halo Body] is more accurate than the burdensome thing,” Thomas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgze6F"&gt;The accuracy held for people of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, and body types. “It makes those same kinds of accuracy measurements for people across the spectrum from lean to obese,” says Steven Heymsfield, a body composition expert at Pennington Biomedical Research Center who worked on the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbMct8"&gt;Notably, in the study Halo Body got closer to the DXA’s body fat calculations than the body mass index, or BMI. BMI is often used as a first, crude estimate of someone’s body fat, and it’s calculated based on height and weight. But often, people who are muscular (and weigh more) can have a BMI that says they’re overweight — even if most of that mass is muscle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3J7l1"&gt;BMI is cheap and easy, so it’s appealing as a first look at someone’s body mass and in situations where expensive equipment, like the pod, might not be available. “BMI is still used as the red flag,” Thomas says. But if the Halo Body — which is also easy and cheaper than the lab equipment — is better than BMI, it could be a strong additional resource, she says. “It gives you more accuracy than the crude things we’ve been using.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4bd2N"&gt;There are other devices on the market that also calculate body fat percentage based on images. Heymsfield says he has some in his lab, which range from $4,000 to $20,000. The Halo Band is $99.99 and the subscription for its services is $3.99 per month. This study did not compare Halo Body to those tools. Heymsfield says, though, that based on his experience, it looks like Halo Body could work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdpoEQ"&gt;Technology like the Halo Body is shaking up the field of body composition research, after years of reliance on expensive devices, Heymsfield says. “The question now is, can we use this for research and clinical purposes, not just for the consumer out of curiosity. Can we use this as a real medical device to get body shape and size, so that people can use it to make clinical decisions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doLawn"&gt;It’ll take more validation studies to get to that point. Heymsfield says he’d want to see data on how accurately the Halo Body can estimate waist and hip circumference, for example. Thomas says additional studies should include people with different body types (like athletes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20JexO"&gt;Testing the tool on more people and people with different body types will also be important for consumer use to make sure everyone is getting information with the same accuracy, Thomas says. But one of the best ways to get that information will be to see what happens when people start to use it in the real world. Then, experts will be able to see what kinds of information people are getting from the tool and if they’re making any changes as a result, she says. “At the end of the day, how do you change public health? It’s not the lab rats, it’s actually the people that are using these tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The smart home gym that analyzes your moves will soon have Olympian trainers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xulQrV9X_6Of3fCaScK1QWBtD4I=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466818/04_Tempo_Garage.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xqs1js"&gt;Tempo, the company behind the piece of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction"&gt;exercise equipment that uses Microsoft Kinect&lt;/a&gt; to check your form, is announcing that it’ll have Olympians teach classes on its connected device. The classes are being made as part of an event that’s called the Tempo Games challenge, which will involve participating in workouts led by seven Olympic athletes that will be headed to Tokyo this year — you can see Tempo’s list below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="x8GBY8"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/carlinisles/?hl=en"&gt;Carlin Isles&lt;/a&gt;: Carlin Isles is a champion track and field athlete and the world’s fastest rugby player, holding several records at his alma mater, Ashland University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5JwFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicatatianalong/?hl=en"&gt;Jessica Long&lt;/a&gt;: Jessica Long is one of the world’s most decorated swimmers with over 50 cumulative medals. She was also amongst the youngest competitors for the U.S. when she made her international debut at the 2004 Athens Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfrGyT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnnyhooper/?hl=en"&gt;Johnny Hooper&lt;/a&gt;: A four-time All-American water polo player, Johnny Hooper was instrumental in leading his team to a NCAA championship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIuHPc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kyra_condie/"&gt;Kyra Condie&lt;/a&gt;: Climbing since she was 11 years old and overcoming idiopathic scoliosis, Kyra Condie was a Bouldering World Cup finalist in addition to a regular in the pro climbing competitions around the U.S. and is bound for Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPQg3T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leticiabufoni/"&gt;Letícia Bufoni&lt;/a&gt;: Letícia Bufoni has been skating since she was 9-years-old and is a multi-X Games gold medalist. Letícia is a member of Brazil’s first-ever national skateboarding team and will be among the first to compete in skateboarding in Tokyo on behalf of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0fz87"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/aka_mcfierce/?hl=en"&gt;Paige McPherson&lt;/a&gt;: Paige Arielle “McFierce” McPherson is a 2012 Olympic bronze medalist, Pan Am Games Champ and Grand Prix Champ. She will be competing in the Tokyo Games and will be the first U.S. female athlete to compete in three Games for TaeKwonDo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1vSwy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/willclaye/?hl=en"&gt;Will Claye&lt;/a&gt;: A three time Olympic medalist, Will Claye earned the bronze medal in the long jump and a silver medal in the triple jump, making him the first man since 1936 and the first American since 1904 to medal in both events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJhnUlzz2z2pfXRpLXi9Yvk7BDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19747784/08_Tempo_Feedback.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tempo Studio can give you feedback on how well you’re performing a given move.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdqzWJ"&gt;The Tempo Studio, which is the device users will access the classes from, is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction"&gt;wardrobe-like piece of home gym equipment&lt;/a&gt; that includes a 42-inch touchscreen, weights, and Microsoft Kinect tech that tracks your movement to ensure that you’re doing workout moves correctly. When one of our writers used the Tempo Studio, it also provided an exercise summary with feedback on how to improve your next workout. The classes, including the upcoming Tempo Games ones, are delivered as part of Tempo’s $39-a-month subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n24NZo"&gt;Tempo says that the classes are “inspired” by the athletes’ own training routines, and that they aim to train both your body and your mind. The classes will cover categories like HIIT, strength training, and more, and the Tempo Games challenge will involve completing 14 of them in three weeks, starting June 21st — those who do will get a limited-edition shirt, according to Tempo’s press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnCbbp"&gt;The Tokyo Olympics were meant to take place in 2020, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21174606/summer-olympics-2020-postponed-coronavirus-delay-date"&gt;were postponed&lt;/a&gt; until July 23rd, 2021 due to COVID-19. Since then, both the International Olympics Committee and companies have worked to find some way to introduce a virtual element to the games. The IOC has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464255/olympic-virtual-series-esports-most-popular-games"&gt;an official Olympics virtual series&lt;/a&gt;, which includes classic sports like baseball and cycling, as well as a tournament that will be held in the video game &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/em&gt;, and connected fitness company Peloton has &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/champions-collection/"&gt;its Champions series&lt;/a&gt; of classes led by athletes like Usain Bolt and Scout Bassett.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram Reels now has ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVXV5V4TJam7gPLkRUCD8BbeyVY=/0x0:1812x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466809/reels_ads.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwjPTD"&gt;Get ready to start seeing ads in Instagram Reels. The app’s video feed / TikTok clone will start including ads today across the globe. They’ll look just like any other Reel — full-screen, looping, up to 30 seconds long — and will appear in between other clips. Ads will be identified by a small “sponsored” tag below the name of the advertiser’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ou1F9l"&gt;Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396841/instagram-reels-ads-stickers-video-facebook"&gt;started testing ads&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, Brazil, Germany, and India in April. There’s nothing particularly surprising about more ads making their way into the app, other than the pace with which Instagram has moved to turn this new format into a revenue generator. Facebook also said this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;it would bring ads to Oculus Quest apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QRgJ8"&gt;Reels only launched in August 2020, and the company has yet to share specifics on how the new format has actually been performing. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast"&gt;Instagram leader Adam Mosseri told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the format is growing but that the company is “not yet happy with it.” The feature is currently available in “more than 80 countries,” an Instagram spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzupTZ"&gt;Meanwhile, TikTok has such a huge audience and its ads have been so successful that the company plans to charge up to $2 million for a one-day takeover, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/tiktok-is-jacking-up-prices-as-it-builds-its-ad-business"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But while TikTok’s influence continues to grow (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528534/tiktok-biden-wechat-executive-order-trump-ban-commerce"&gt;and its legal threat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;continues to be postponed&lt;/a&gt;), Instagram still retains the huge advantages of having Facebook’s support behind it and being able to tap into an already massive app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite will launch first on Nintendo Switch in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYafg7bSO3pT3ZxUlJNXiCJ9w5Y=/0x0:1329x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466685/unitenew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3984Wl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team-based, five vs. five strategy game co-developed with Tencent’s TiMi Studio Group, now has a release window — and it’s soon. It’s coming first to Nintendo Switch in July 2021, followed by a release on mobile devices in September. Presumably, it’ll be released on both iOS and Android, but specific platforms weren’t confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B10MAj"&gt;In case you can’t decide which platform you want to play the game on, don’t fret too much, as &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; will support cross-play between Nintendo’s console and mobile devices. &lt;a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/NEW-INFORMATION-REVEALED-FOR-Pokemon-UNITE"&gt;The Pokémon Company announced&lt;/a&gt; that the game will also support cross-progression, which can be enabled by signing in with either your Pokémon Trainer Club account or Nintendo Account on the devices that you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFCoJW"&gt;The game will be free to start, with optional in-game purchases available, including the paid “Aeos gems” currency. You’ll get Aeos coins and tickets just from playing the game, which can unlock cosmetics and other items. There will be season battle passes that you can level up over time to earn in-game rewards. Those paid Aeos gems I mentioned earlier will let you pay to get rewards in the battle pass if you don’t want to put the time in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nynjC"&gt;Like my colleague Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302958/pokemon-unite-esports-competitive-gaming-league-of-legends"&gt;said last year when the game was announced&lt;/a&gt;, a strategy-laced &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game might seem like a strange combination, and it’s splashing onto the scene years after MOBAs like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; exploded in popularity. Yet, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; has a familiar cast of characters, and that might be enough to open the genre up to a new wave of fans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Performing Hamlet in GTA Online is simply the best theater experience lockdown can offer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed_00CdnQ4lsDpX84zQS6zEP2PI=/168x0:1517x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466635/Screen_Shot_2021_06_17_at_3.10.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uV15rc"&gt;Plenty of actors can, I’m sure, cite plays they were in where the audience was bored, listless, or simply nonexistent. But few have had to contend with the challenges presented by performing in a public lobby in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online. &lt;/em&gt;That’s a shame, frankly, because it’s hilarious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyjHxg"&gt;A YouTuber by the name of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCmwCCmU6D0tSYijfIpg8A"&gt;Rustic Mascara&lt;/a&gt; has been testing the limits of this bold new performance space, and, though I can’t explain exactly why, I find it amazing to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWRT1T"&gt;In one video (above), he performs a speech from Act II Scene ii, in which Hamlet explains to his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern why exactly he is so very, very sad. In Rustic’s performance, this is prefaced by requests to nearby players that they please not kill him.  He gets as far as lamenting that the Earth itself “appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors” before being blown up by a rocket. He then respawns and continues with the extremely apt next line “What a piece of work is a man” before being killed again, moments later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaypDX"&gt;Honestly, this is Shakespeare as Shakespeare himself would have wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h21KZm"&gt;Another video (below) shows Rustic and a friend performing the play’s opening scene in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;’s own Vinewood Bowl. Again, things don’t exactly go smoothly, but there’s something incredible about watching the two characters (a pair of guards on night watch) reassure one another that they’ve heard “not a mouse stirring” as the sound of sirens and gunshots fill the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KUwfJH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54sCXRvP3Y0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTG6iV"&gt;That’s all we’ve really got from Rustic so far (there’s two other videos on his channel, but they’re not as good), though I hope his future attempts gather more support. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online &lt;/em&gt;has entertained players with heists and races, but what about incentivizing players to form roving theater troupes, each attempting to perform the classics while fending off rival gangs of gun-wielding actors? After all, a little bit of culture never hurt anybody. &lt;/p&gt;
