    <title>Ford nabs $884 million incentive package for EV ‘mega campus’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKdQEm"&gt;Tennessee lawmakers have approved an $884 million incentive package for the “mega campus” near Memphis where Ford plans to make batteries and electric vehicles, &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/20/tennessee-legislature-gives-final-approval-884-m-ford-deal/8538425002/"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Tennessean&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uyNaG"&gt;The money — which is coming from Tennessee’s current $2.1 billion budget surplus — is the single largest investment in the history of the state. It comes at a time when many major automakers are looking to build new facilities in the US dedicated to EVs, batteries, or other supply chain components necessary for electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBN2MT"&gt;Ford itself has committed to spending more than $5 billion on the Tennessee project with South Korean battery company SK Innovation, which it calls “Blue Oval City.” Ford is also simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696427/ford-ev-battery-factory-tennessee-kentucky-investment"&gt;spinning up battery factories in Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L3kO2T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A $500 million grant, plus hundreds of millions more marked for construction costs &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xGBTI1"&gt;Ford will get $500 million in the form of a grant. The rest is being allocated in a few different ways — the result of a special session held this week where &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2021/10/20/tennessee-legislature-gives-final-approval-884-m-ford-deal/8538425002/"&gt;state legislators haggled for three days&lt;/a&gt;. The state will commit $200 million for road construction around the site and $138.2 million for other infrastructure and demolition work. Another $40 million will go to building a Tennessee College of Applied Technology site near the campus, and $5 million is being offered up for legal services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vLA4ud"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ford reveals plans for massive EV and battery factories in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696427/ford-ev-battery-factory-tennessee-kentucky-investment"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Xa5HRr"&gt;Lastly, $745,100 will go toward starting a governing body called the “Megasite Authority of West Tennessee.” It will consist of 11 members, including Gov. Bill Lee, the state’s House Speaker, and the lieutenant governor. This board will be able to guide land acquisitions, including the ability to use seize private land using eminent domain, though owners have to be fairly compensated. The board will also oversee water management and other contracts related to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSZSG0"&gt;Ford has said the Tennessee campus will stretch nine square miles and will be the biggest facility it has ever built — far eclipsing even its historic River Rouge complex in Michigan (where Ford plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441276/ford-electric-f150-truck-factory-break-ground-michigan"&gt;build the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;). The company claims Blue Oval City will create 6,000 new jobs, though Gov. Lee’s office said this week that the state expects 27,000 jobs to be created when counting “direct, indirect, and induced” roles. Tennessee says it expects the project to generate $22.4 million per year in state tax revenue but $1 billion in annual earnings for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mT49mR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An 11-person board will oversee the project&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gdYdNl"&gt;Ford evaluated a few different sites before landing on Tennessee earlier this year. CEO Jim Farley said two main reasons were the low cost of energy in the state and the availability of an undeveloped site with no environmental problems. (Officials in Ford’s home state of Michigan have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChadLivengood/status/1443250252929196032"&gt;not been too happy with the decision&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="W7IXWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The epic campaign to win Elon Musk’s Tesla factory with memes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vdGsBg"&gt;Tesla helped supercharge the trend of big incentive packages for EV plants in 2014 when it pitted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937076/tesla-gigafactory-battery-factory-nevada-tax-deal-elon-musk"&gt;multiple states against each other&lt;/a&gt; as it searched for a home for the original Gigafactory. The gambit worked, as Tesla netted a $1.3 billion incentive package from Nevada — the largest that state had ever given out at the time. More recently, though, Tesla turned down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;a potentially massive incentive package from Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, in favor of building its newest factory in Austin, Texas, where it received just a few million dollars in tax breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Pt4ml"&gt;Ford is not alone in this effort, as there are a handful of similar factory projects underway as automakers spend billions to create new electric vehicle lineups. GM has announced plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;multiple battery factories in the works with LG Chem&lt;/a&gt; (one was even rumored to be in Tennessee at one point), and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; and Toyota have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732641/toyota-ev-battery-factory-us-investment-spend-amount"&gt;recently said they will build battery factories, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Micro Center leaks specs and pricing for Intel’s new Alder Lake Core i9 CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GbnQ7ZT3x9qEJ5z1MgF3c8N6zZQ=/186x0:1482x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70030545/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.16.23_AM.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFFOdK"&gt;Even though someone managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740060/intel-core-i9-12900k-sold-early"&gt;secure early purchases of a couple of Core i9-12900K CPUs&lt;/a&gt;, we still didn’t have detailed information about Intel’s upcoming line of Alder Lake chips. A (now-removed, but shown below) sale page &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/641915/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-32ghz-sixteen-core-lga-1700-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included#tab-specs"&gt;popped up on Micro Center&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting the chips will be available for $669.99 when they launch on November 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2SzPgorpUvfSf9Bbp3A1MNKE7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948094/micro_center_alder_lake_core_i9_12900k_specs.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LQMLKq"&gt;The spec sheet reveals this chip will have a 3.2GHz operating frequency, capable of 5.2GHz in Turbo Mode, with 16 cores and 30MB of L3 cache. As expected, the specs reveal it also supports DDR5 memory, PCIe Gen 5, and the Intel Z690 chipset motherboards that should go on sale at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMzMGu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22631059/intel-alder-lake-chip-hybrid-architecture-day-2021-desktop-laptop-preview-cores"&gt;During its Architecture Day 2021 event in August&lt;/a&gt;, Intel promised Alder Lake chips with 16 cores using eight performance cores and eight efficient ones. This leak lines up with the top-end promises, right down to listed support for 24 concurrent threads (two each on performance cores, one thread at a time on the efficient cores) and 125W thermal power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXfDQQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 2:07PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted listing on Micro Center has been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft’s first-ever safety report reveals over 4,000 assaults between 2017-2019</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber and Lyft sign in windshield of car, Queens, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SqmU7DMUEzuTLUM1emhIlPou8To=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032145/1310967778.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: Lindsey Nicholson/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jq4R3r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: this story contains descriptions of sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BH0kb6"&gt;Ten people were killed in physical altercations and over 4,000 people were assaulted during Lyft rides from 2017-2019, the company revealed in its &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf"&gt;first-ever safety report&lt;/a&gt;. Also during that period, 105 people died in fatal vehicle crashes involving a Lyft car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9bUOq"&gt;The report was long overdue, coming at least two years after Lyft originally said that it would be published. It represents the first set of publicly available data regarding the safety of Lyft’s ride-hailing platform and how it compares to national US averages. The company is currently facing multiple lawsuits from victims of sexual assault and rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zSGt6q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the numbers appear to paint a dark picture of the ride-hailing industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I147le"&gt;While the numbers appear to paint a dark picture of the ride-hailing industry, Lyft insists that serious incidents are “statistically rare” in its vehicles. “The type of safety incidents detailed in this report occurred on 0.0002 percent of rides,” Jennifer Brandenburger, Head of Policy Development and Research, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Fblog%2Fposts%2Flyfts-community-safety-report&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22740609%2Flyft-safety-report-2017-2019-physical-sexual-assault-death" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, “and well over 99 percent of all rides occur without any safety report at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRqZAl"&gt;Reports of sexual assault in a Lyft ride increased from 1,096 in 2017 to 1,807 in 2019. But the company said bookings increased at a higher rate during that time, resulting in a 19 percent drop in the overall incident rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTGx6"&gt;“While safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we realize that even one is too many,” Brandenburger said. “Behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our goal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3zA4N"&gt;Ride-hailing companies have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;safety reports&lt;/a&gt;, Uber disclosed that 3,045 sexual assaults occurred on Uber trips in 2018 and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/6/20999399/uber-2019-safety-report"&gt;another 3,000 in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, nine people were murdered during Uber rides, and 58 people died in auto-related crashes. Uber said that drivers reported being victims of assaults at roughly the same rate as riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2VpYO3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ride-hailing companies have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wWGYFv"&gt;Lyft’s spin on the report, grim as the numbers may be, is similar to Uber’s take on its own data. Lyft, which services fewer trips than Uber, did not disclose the total number of rides represented in its report, but at 0.0002 percent, the incident rate was the same as Uber’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qh9RsO"&gt;Driver groups criticized Lyft for a lack of attention to safety, especially as it relates to drivers. The report reveals that 10 drivers were killed in fatal assaults. “Lyft frames these fatalities as anomalies,” the group Gig Workers Rising said in a statement. “The truth is ten people are dead. Their families are left with no support from Lyft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dph4tj"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html"&gt;19 women sued Lyft&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to prevent sexual assault perpetrated by drivers and for doing little to investigate the complaints. A California woman who says she was raped by a Lyft driver in 2017 also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870765/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit-alison-turkos-safety-complaints"&gt;sued the company in September&lt;/a&gt; over failing to keep riders safe, while 14 additional women &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit/index.html"&gt;sued Lyft earlier in September&lt;/a&gt; over its handling of sexual assault complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXNwwZ"&gt;Uber and Lyft both conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority. They also have largely attempted to tackle this issue through technology updates, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us"&gt;in-app “panic buttons,”&lt;/a&gt; which let riders instantly dial 911, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143679/uber-rider-reporting-safety-issue-driver-trip"&gt;ways to report a driver for unsafe activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6VguE"&gt;Earlier this year, the companies joined together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325675/uber-lyft-driver-deactivate-assault-murder-share-safety"&gt;to announce a “first-of-its-kind” effort &lt;/a&gt;to share information about drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses, including physical and sexual assault and murder. Drivers are classified as independent contractors, not employees, meaning they can — and frequently do — drive for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feds reportedly take down top ransomware hacker group REvil with a hack of their own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eFikt-oGQcQ2TmMUeWPEsOl9Qtc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032139/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dUXHdA"&gt;The government has successfully hacked the hacking group REvil, the entity behind the ransomware that’s been linked to leaked Apple leaks, attacks on enterprise software vendors, and more, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The outlet’s sources tell it that the FBI, Secret Service, Cyber Command, and organizations from other countries have worked together to take the group’s operations offline this month. The group’s dark web blog, which exposed information gleaned from its targets, is also reportedly offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGeZwj"&gt;Reports about the group going offline started surfacing earlier this week, with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; writing that &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/revil-ransomware-group-goes-dark-after-its-tor-sites-were-hijacked/"&gt;its Tor website was no longer available on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. There was speculation of a hack, fueled by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddd1ms/status/1449865145308651528"&gt;a forum post from one of the group’s suspected leaders&lt;/a&gt; saying that its server was “compromised,” but at the time, it was unclear who was responsible. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; cites sources that say the government’s operation against ransomware hackers, including REvil, is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mdNhsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US has been turning the screws on ransomware groups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pSpqwi"&gt;The US is slowly turning the screws on groups associated with ransomware, as the attacks become more and more costly for companies (one company reportedly paid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;$40 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; to restore its operations). The Treasury pushed sanctions that make it harder to turn hacked machines into cash, and the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714241/us-justice-department-cryptocurrency-enforcement-unit"&gt;created a team&lt;/a&gt; for investigating crimes committed by cryptocurrency exchanges, citing the impact of ransomware several times in &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/7ab719c2-7813-4131-96cd-10ccb7e93dc3"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lU4E3J"&gt;REvil has had plenty of heat on it due to the high-profile or high-impact nature of the attacks it’s linked to. It’s blamed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;an attack on an Apple supplier&lt;/a&gt; that leaked schematics of the MacBooks that launched this week, as well as attacks on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;massive meat processor JBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;IT management software developer Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054951/travelex-currency-exchange-offline-malware-attack-ransom"&gt;Travelex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;. The group was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;named by the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&lt;/a&gt; as one of the biggest ransomware groups in terms of reported payouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BAbf3O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;REvil is one of the largest ransomware groups, according to the Treasury&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsfDM7"&gt;REvil has gone offline before —  &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57826851"&gt;its site disappeared from the dark web&lt;/a&gt; in July, just a month after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466003/jbs-cyberattack-fbi-revil-sodinokibi-criminal-group"&gt;FBI said the group was responsible&lt;/a&gt; for bringing down JBS, a company responsible for a fifth of the world’s meat supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kt6kr"&gt;It’s always possible that the group could come back, though trying to recover from going down in July is reportedly what opened it up to attacks from the US in the first place.  &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; sources&lt;/a&gt;, one of the group’s members restored a backup and unwittingly included systems compromised by law enforcement. A Russian security expert tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that infecting backups is a tactic commonly used by REvil itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will let you subscribe to a newsletter right from a tweet</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8kE6IY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter bought out the email newsletter service, Revue&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this year, hoping to engage journalists and writers who want to share long-form content without feeling limited by Twitter’s 280 character limit. Now, the newly integrated service is getting an update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NFKuQz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  We’ve got big news. (You’re really going to like this.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting today, your followers can subscribe to Revue newsletters directly from Tweets in their timeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is already enabled for all Revue writers on desktop and mobile web, with iOS and Android to follow soon. ✨ &lt;a href="https://t.co/6eBxvGWyxH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6eBxvGWyxH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Revue (@revue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1451564116007657472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GAMDf"&gt;In a tweet, Revue revealed that users can now subscribe to a newsletter just by clicking on a link in a Tweet. And if a user’s email address is linked to their Twitter account, they can now subscribe with a single click, with no email verification required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQRggG"&gt;Revue notes that while the feature is currently available to Revue users on desktop and web, it’s set to arrive on Android and iOS in the near future. This comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632414/twitter-newsletter-subscription-button-revue-profile"&gt;Twitter tested out a newsletter subscription button on users’ profiles&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8QbJH"&gt;Twitter’s acquisition of Revue puts it head-to-head with Substack, a paid newsletter service that helps users establish a following of readers. As Casey Newton notes in &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-i-learned-from-a-year-on-substack"&gt;his article on &lt;em&gt;The Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, popularity on Substack largely depends on your audience on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kuUuqt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The only way a Substack grows is through tweets”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J5Jxuo"&gt;“The only way a Substack grows is through tweets,” Newton said after using the service for a year. “I wish I had other obvious avenues for growth, but to date, it really feels like it’s Twitter or nothing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZEnNd"&gt;With Revue becoming even more ingrained in Twitter’s interface, one can only imagine the effect this might have on Substack users. Creators may feel more inclined to use Revue instead, thanks to its convenience and the fact that it seamlessly integrates into their tweets and profiles. While you can point readers to your Substack via social media, it may need better promotion options — perhaps some that are built into certain networks. Otherwise, Revue could begin to outpace it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQtrqlpNNUdjBoiPqyrrDQIFMS8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031940/Invasion_Photo_010202.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0cD52c"&gt;For a show about an alien invasion,&lt;em&gt; Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is decidedly lacking in aliens thus far. The latest sci-fi drama on Apple TV Plus, the series debuts with three episodes, which, theoretically, should give viewers a good sense of what to expect. Instead, those episodes oh-so-slowly introduce you to characters and stories without giving much of a hint as to how it all connects aside from the teaseist of teases. Three hours in, and I’m still not even sure what it’s about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYfhd0"&gt;The big hook of &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s a global story. The idea is that you’ll be able to see the impact of this event from a bunch of different perspectives, and at the very least, it succeeds at that (albeit with the expected American-centric viewpoint). Over the first few episodes, you’re introduced to a sheriff in Oklahoma, a housewife in Long Island, a US soldier stationed in Afghanistan, a teen in London, and an expert in Tokyo working with the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4v9II"&gt;And the show’s creators &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want you to know each of these individuals. The first three episodes are spent almost entirely on setting up their lives and circumstances. You’ll see a marriage slowly unravel (with some help from Find My iPhone, in one of the more obvious bits of product placement on Apple TV Plus) and watch a boy’s struggles with an almost pathological bully at school. I was particularly drawn into a secretive relationship between two women at the Japanese space agency that’s tragically cut short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bULNKY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2xFrbVNx0U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R2oUYZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2LBsGJ"&gt;Many of these stories are interesting, even if they often delve into cliche; the sheriff, of course, is one day away from retirement before the invasion starts to happen. The problem is that the ratio of human drama and sci-fi storytelling is completely out of whack. Across the first three hours, there are only hints of alien elements. There’s the usual like crop circles and fleeing animals, as well as some more unsettling moments like when an entire music class simultaneously gets a nosebleed. Eventually, things start crashing into the planet, causing havoc while TV news reports blame it on terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7X1WI"&gt;I’m all for a slow burn, but after three episodes, I should have some clearer sense of the titular&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;invasion. (Apple’s other big sci-fi drama, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, is similarly slow, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;but at least it’s pretty to look at&lt;/a&gt;.) Here the pacing feels like it's stopping this invasion dead in its tracks. It's great meeting the characters and having a strong sense of their lives before aliens blow it up, but I am also here to see actual aliens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOc8VT"&gt;It’s entirely plausible that things pick up soon, and the sci-fi elements are actually interesting. We still have seven episodes to go. (New episodes will release every Friday, like most series on Apple.) But early on, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; demands far too much of viewers, expecting them to stick around without giving much assurance of an eventual payoff. Please, just show me an alien already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s social network has 30 days to stop breaking the rules of its software license</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - October 18, 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCv4wpmh3dgSvNCSbBfUul4_LOg=/0x0:6679x4453/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031810/1347355440.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Devaney/GC Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2ICgm"&gt;The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-groups-violates-affero-gpl/"&gt;says former President Donald Trump’s new social network violated&lt;/a&gt; a free and open-source software licensing agreement by ripping off decentralized social network Mastodon. The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has 30 days to comply with the terms of the license before its access is terminated — forcing it to rebuild the platform or face legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqiGPQ"&gt;TMTG launched a special purpose acquisition company fundraising effort yesterday with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738240/donald-trump-truth-social-spac-dwac-stock-merger"&gt;promises to build a sweeping media empire&lt;/a&gt;. Its only product so far is a social network called Truth Social that appears strongly to be &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump"&gt;forked from Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. While anyone can freely reuse Mastodon’s code (and groups like right-wing social network Gab &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;have already done so&lt;/a&gt;), they still have to comply with the Affero General Public License (or AGPLv3) that governs that code, and its conditions include offering their own source code to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V84GDP"&gt;Truth Social doesn’t comply with that license and, in fact, refers to its service as “proprietary.” Its developers apparently attempted to scrub references that would make the Mastodon connection clear — at one point &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewharwell/status/1451259053699653649"&gt;listing a “sighting”&lt;/a&gt; of the Mastodon logo as a bug — but included direct references to Mastodon in the site’s underlying HTML alongside obvious visual similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9txvSq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Truth Social must offer its source code to the pranksters who defaced it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gXH5M5"&gt;TMTG’s strategy hasn’t sat well with the SFC, an organization that enforces free and open-source software licenses. “The license purposefully treats everyone equally (even people we don’t like or agree with), but they must operate under the same rules of the copyleft licenses that apply to everyone else,” SFC policy fellow Bradley Kuhn &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-groups-violates-affero-gpl/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Today, we saw the Trump Media and Technology Group ignoring those important rules — which were designed for the social good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJPBvZ"&gt;Truth Social hasn’t officially launched. But users could access a test version of the platform, where many of them created prank accounts that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/trump-truth-social-fake-accounts/"&gt;flooded the service&lt;/a&gt; with false company announcements and even fake Donald Trump posts. (The platform has since been replaced by a waitlist.) The SFC demands that TMTG offer all these users access to the Truth Social source code. “If they fail to do this within 30 days, their rights and permissions in the software are automatically and permanently terminated,” Kuhn says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eDU1A"&gt;If Truth Social fails to make the source code available, the SFC could sue it for violating the terms of the license it used. Earlier this year, the group sued electronics maker Vizio for “repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements” of free software licensing. “We will be following this issue very closely and demanding that Trump’s Group give the corresponding source to all who use the site,” Kuhn writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNIbTG"&gt;Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko also said yesterday that he intended to seek legal counsel about the situation, although he didn’t discuss a specific course of action. “Compliance with our AGPLv3 license is very important to me as that is the sole basis upon which I and other developers are willing to give away years of work for free,” &lt;a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/nice-start-trumps-truth-app-may-violate-terms-of-open-source-code-its-built-on"&gt;he told &lt;em&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Home Alone is now a $250 Lego set, and it might be the most impressive fan-inspired model yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1itW3OLcnZU31zt-alLUVVFIPs=/0x145:2560x1852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031487/home_alone_lego_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Complete with treehouse zip line and traps&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6d3oPF"&gt;Some of the most amazing Lego sets of the past decade have been dreamt up by fans — and this week, the Danish toy brick company revealed its largest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241339/metroid-lego-set-voting-process-ideas-nintendo"&gt;Lego Ideas&lt;/a&gt; set yet. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Flego-ideas-home-alone-21330&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22739574%2Fhome-alone-movie-lego-set" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s Kevin McCallister’s iconic house from &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a 3,955-piece marvel filled with movie moments, hidden references, and a number of Kevin’s booby traps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKmDN4"&gt;Kevin can slide down the stairs on his sled, land a clothes iron on Marv’s face, zipline down to his treehouse, break the shelves that release Buzz’s tarantula, drop a paint can, and more. Lego even recreated the scary basement furnace with its opening jaws, with a light-up brick so it can glow, and there’s a gear you can turn to spin the train set and turntable that Kevin disguised as people (to make it look like someone was “home”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPOaim"&gt;The whole build opens up like a dollhouse, including a full attic playspace you access by flipping up the roof, and each floor can lift off if you’d rather interact from the top down. As &lt;em&gt;The Brothers Brick &lt;/em&gt;point out &lt;a href="https://www.brothers-brick.com/2021/10/21/lego-ideas-21330-home-alone-house-the-largest-ideas-set-ever-is-packed-with-movie-references-review/"&gt;in their review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s got a few never-before-seen bricks, too: the door with the pet flap is new here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuOOBY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Flego-ideas-home-alone-21330&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F22%2F22739574%2Fhome-alone-movie-lego-set" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The set’s going on sale November 1st&lt;/a&gt; for $250, and I don’t think I’m going to be able to resist — heck, I just spent half an hour marveling at the high-res images. Here, I’ll share them with you! &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New US rules on spyware exports try to limit surveillance tech like Pegasus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUT5MpG0EWZTg0ytLW6oUAhWusE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70031421/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hybpBC"&gt;The US Department of Commerce announced &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/21/2021-22774/information-security-controls-cybersecurity-items"&gt;a new rule&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the sale of hacking tools to China and Russia, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/commerce-department-announces-new-rule-aimed-at-stemming-sale-of-hacking-tools-to-repressive-governments/2021/10/20/ecb56428-311b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The Commerce Department outlined the change in a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/10/commerce-tightens-export-controls-items-used-surveillance-private"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, which requires US companies to have a license in order to sell spyware and other hacking software to countries “of national security or weapons of mass destruction concern.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZEfYx"&gt;The rule is complex and purposefully so. If a US company wants to export spyware to a government that poses a national security concern, the company would need a license. But if the software is specifically for cyber defense and not sold to anyone associated with the government, no license would be needed. As &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; explains, companies will need a license to export hacking software and equipment to China, Russia, and other listed nations, whether for cyber defense or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RoUH48"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The United States is committed to working with our multilateral partners to deter the spread of certain technologies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="laWupJ"&gt;“The United States is committed to working with our multilateral partners to deter the spread of certain technologies that can be used for malicious activities that threaten cybersecurity and human rights,” said Gina M. Raimondo, the US Secretary of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMqjnv"&gt;The rule is set to go into effect in late January and targets tools and software like Pegasus. This intrusive software, made by Israel-based company NSO Group, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582532/pegasus-nso-spyware-target-phones-journalists-activists-investigation"&gt;was used by governments to spy on smartphones belonging to journalists and human rights activists&lt;/a&gt;. It’s able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22589942/nso-group-pegasus-project-amnesty-investigation-journalists-activists-targeted"&gt;steal data from mobile phones and even turn a device’s mic&lt;/a&gt;, all while going unnoticed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="De07kG"&gt;Although the US is a member of the &lt;a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/wassenaar"&gt;Wassenaar Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;, a voluntary export control regime that sets rules on the export of dual-use technologies, it’s one of the last of the 42 participating countries to impose restrictions on the sale of hacking tools. Security officials who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Post &lt;/em&gt;say that the US took so long to create the rule due to its complexity — if done incorrectly, having such a limitation could prevent cybersecurity specialists from collaborating with experts from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvNdSD"&gt;The Department of Commerce is allowing a period of 45 days for public comment and then another 45 days to make any additional changes before it officially goes into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to customize your iPhone’s app icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOdBcTTheQdzuU1CVztawE8DbsE=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69446002/bfarsace_201106_4269_030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CT8iXi"&gt;Have you ever wanted to make your iPhone your own, with your individualized style and flair? Sure, you can change your home screen wallpaper. But if you really want to personalize your phone, why not create your own app icons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4hFLk"&gt;It’s doable, using Apple’s built-in Shortcuts app. You actually won’t be replacing the icons that the apps came with — rather, you’ll be creating separate shortcuts that lead to the app.   It’s a tedious and time-consuming process, but in the end, you can have a fully customized iPhone home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTqHfS"&gt;Here’s how you do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4A9Oyt"&gt;Before you begin, it’s a good idea to find an icon for your new shortcut. There are a bunch of icon sources online (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flaticon.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22529978%2Fapple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Flaticon&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or if you’re artistic and / or ambitious, you can create your own. Whether you use someone else’s or your own, save the image to Photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4opbvA"&gt;Okay, let’s begin. Find and tap on the Shortcuts app. It’s pre-installed; if you can’t see it immediately on your home screen, swipe left until you’re at the App Library and start typing “Shortcuts” into the top search bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dA4Adi"&gt;Once you’re in the app, tap on the “plus” sign in the upper-right corner. Type the name of your new shortcut on top, and then tap on “Add Action”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shortcut can help you create new bookmarks for your apps" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmTDxfYPnlWBvy5ksFZwCCeVnMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653452/IMG_9007135DEFEF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortcuts can help you create new bookmarks for your apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uEijEWhSAHyFqJ9T5oqG4WvJ3vY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945508/IMG_D954C140D41F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After you select the plus sign to start a new shortcut, tap on Add Action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Rl4v05"&gt;There are a lot of interesting things to try out in Shortcuts. But right now, what we want to do is switch app icons. Type “Open app” in the search bar and then tap on the “Open App” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XCKRrg"&gt;Tap on the word “App” that appears (rather faintly) next to the word “Open.” You’ll see a list of your apps; pick the one you want to customize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zwuizA"&gt;Now, tap the blue symbol in the upper right corner. You’ll be taken back to your shortcut page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Type “Open app” in the search bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gevNxwMcl4ZoUkKfC_1rXQF0M9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945593/IMG_4F75405CF491_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Type “Open app” in the search bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap “App” to select which icon to replace." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0yQJPUJfMIHPa974FkTA-jIKOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945595/IMG_22637E24C8DD_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap “App” to select which icon to replace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HzgHOz"&gt;Tap “Add to Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uuIAM1"&gt;You’ll now see a preview of the icon (which will be a standard, uninteresting icon that Shortcuts automatically adds). Don’t worry — we’re going to make it better. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4diHVaFAan70_wVunFyFKyt1bg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945896/IMG_5A159D409582_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Name your shortcut and tap on “Add to Home Screen.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At first, you get a generic icon." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpqlPJlBKnT0wSSeVIn8cNh2Rcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653474/IMG_5A5AAD54523D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qb7nmD"&gt;Tap on the icon under “Home Screen Name and Icon.” You’ll have the choice of either taking a photo, choosing a photo, or choosing a file. Assuming you’ve already saved an image in Photo, tap on “Choose Photo” and select the photo you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="udyrhq"&gt;If you’ve chosen an existing photo, a highlighted area will indicate what part of the photo will appear as an icon; you can move the photo around until you’re happy with the section indicated. Tap “Choose” in the lower-right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVDuCP2oNtlJkjaJJkSN8j_CM7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653487/IMG_8F28F1423B8D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can create an icon from a new photo, a saved photo, or a file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02fQSnoF4bW2iUtHgdeN-rswHUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653493/IMG_2A665EFE27F3_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to crop your photo to the right dimensions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lCKV5y"&gt;Now, you’ll see your new icon. If you haven’t added a name for your new shortcut, you can still do it here by typing the name next to the icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK6ETB"&gt;All ready? Tap Add in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzDhp6"&gt;You should see your new customized icon on your home screen. Congrats!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SBacWP"&gt;There’s the possibility you may see two new icons on your home screen: one with the first boring icon and one with your wonderful new icon. If that’s the case, just press and hold the icon that you don’t want, and then select “Delete bookmark.” Remember, this (and the other you created) is a bookmark / shortcut — not the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Voila! Your new icon is ready" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqDtwhDt2TrnFN05duszNvUc69w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653500/IMG_0D46D384E161_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Voila! Your new icon is ready.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can hide the original icon if you want" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wcXApwlRvi8PzqoYVUXlCHp7iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653502/IMG_141812774F53_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hide the original icon if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uMQx0K"&gt;You can also hide the original app icon so you’ll just have the new one visible. (You don’t want to delete it completely, of course; that would delete the app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4q02gy"&gt;Long-press on the original app icon and select “Edit Home Screen.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8Ppj8h"&gt;Tap on the minus sign. On the pop-up menu, tap “Remove from Home Screen.” The original icon won’t be deleted, just hidden; you can always find it in the App Library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vs46q8"&gt;One note: when you use your new icon to go to the app, you will occasionally get a small drop-down notice that tells you what the original app is called and to remind you of the fact that it is a shortcut. But the drop-down will only last for a second or two, so it shouldn’t be much of a bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTLWzA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 22nd, 2021, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on Jun 13th, 2021; it has been updated to accommodate changes in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
