    <title>Parler is gone for now as Amazon terminates hosting</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HH3EVI"&gt;After Parler was banned on both the Apple and Google app stores for failing to curb violent and threatening content on its platform, the social media site is now completely offline as a result of Amazon terminating Parler’s web hosting services. The official Parler website now returns a 403 error, while its app is showing networking errors and can’t load content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oij1R5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Amazon told Parler of its decision&lt;/a&gt; late Saturday, in a letter to chief policy officer Amy Peikoff. Its Amazon Web Service (AWS) “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;the letter to Peikoff states&lt;/a&gt;, adding that Parler “poses a very real risk to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idJlPKDKDtg5Y6-ZthZ4Tw5JyY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227121/File.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parler’s iOS app, which now can’t load content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApEuFA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;Posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the Wednesday attack on the Capitol that left five people dead were circulated on other platforms in the wake of the riot. An example:  “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” to which another poster replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ruz0"&gt;According to the AWS &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21986678%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt; customers may not use its services “for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing or offensive use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgLpkL"&gt;Parler launched in 2018 presenting itself as a free-speech haven and an alternative to other social media sites. The site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;saw its user numbers spike&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, as Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;tightened their moderation policies&lt;/a&gt;, especially around election and coronavirus information. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained momentum among Parler users, as did other conspiracy theories around the election. Parler’s less-strict moderation policies were part of its appeal for many users, but the lack of content moderation is a big part of why companies suspended their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mW8lXP"&gt;When it pulled Parler from the Play Store, Google said while reasonable debate about content policy was possible, and it can be hard for apps to remove violative content immediately, “for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.” Apple told the company that “the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XKD0V"&gt;Even with the app removed from the Play Store users could still install Parler on their Android devices by downloading it directly from Parler’s website and sideloading it. However, with its AWS services now disabled, the website and apps no longer work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytelNk"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze — who, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjmatze%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22223335%2Fparler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; worked for AWS for three months in 2017 — wrote in a post on Parler late Saturday that he believes Amazon, Google, and Apple “worked together to try and ensure they don’t have competition,” adding “They will NOT win! We are the worlds [sic] last hope for free speech and free information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSELOn"&gt;Matze said in &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/009ba435b68c46d4955e1cd7737fa27c"&gt;a separate post&lt;/a&gt; that the Parler could be offline for up to a week “as we rebuild from scratch.” Matze added, “You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don’t count us out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;Perhaps the best-known recent instance of a site being deplatformed for violent content was social network Gab. After a gunman killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/us/pittsburgh-funerals-synagogue-shooting.html"&gt;eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic threats on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google booted Gab app from its Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;, and AWS &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/far-right-haven-gabcom-had-its-fundraising-site-shut-down"&gt;cut ties with Gab&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, for violating its policy against hateful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZjE3X"&gt;Parler has not responded to multiple requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>V-Moda’s classic headphone design finally gets active noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOmBRIVx2y58IAOm8_LeY-rm1Sw=/0x135:2208x1607/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648543/Screen_Shot_2021_01_10_at_8.13.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ymYbTF"&gt;V-Moda has announced a new version of its M-200 headphones at CES 2021 — the M-200 ANC, which bring both Bluetooth and active noise cancellation to the classic V-Moda design. Those additions come with a jump in price, though, with the M-200 ANC starting at $499.99, a jump of $150 over the wired, non-noise cancelling version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLjNda"&gt;From the outside, the M-200 ANC look extremely similar to their wired cousins, with the same iconic hexagonal design elements that have been emblematic of V-Moda’s headphones for years. Unlike the wired version, though, the drivers have been swapped out to 40mm (from 50mm ones), and there are some new buttons for controlling playback, power, and pairing, as well as a USB-C port for charging. The M-200 ANC headphones are also a touch heavier at 320g (compared to 290g on the wired model.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EQbW1iISiAnrF8E4NV2Dx2humxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226616/Screen_Shot_2021_01_10_at_8.15.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KpLdWP"&gt;As for the noise cancellation, we won’t know how the M-200 ANC measure up to mainstays like Sony and Bose until we get to try them for ourselves, but V-Moda is offering what it calls “hybrid active noise cancellation,” with the option to adjust the level of noise cancellation in a companion app. V-Moda is also offering a “Voice In” feature that allows users to cover the left earcup with their hand to automatically lower volume and pause noise-cancellation. As for battery life, V-Moda says that users should get up to 20 hours off a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnfpGp"&gt;And of course, given V-Moda’s style, there’s the option for customers to order their own custom aluminum shields in a variety of colors with their own logo or artwork engraved on it for a personal touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffxDia"&gt;The new M-200 ANC headphones should be available today for $499.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Display announces its smallest OLED TV panel yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3XjLMWxlatvL3KxjE_Tb1dF18M=/0x11:1972x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68648442/44900793067647000_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcjSV5"&gt;LG Display has provided some details on the OLED panels it’ll be shipping to TV manufacturers this year. The lineup includes a 42-inch panel, the smallest TV-sized OLED yet from LG Display, as well as a new 83-inch panel size that likely features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;the Bravia lineup that Sony unveiled a few days ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaKLDO"&gt;That means that OLED TVs this year will be available in sizes of 42, 48, 55, 65, 77, 83, and 88 inches. LG Display says it’s also shipping a “next-generation” 77-inch panel that’s said to be around 20 percent more efficient and therefore capable of higher brightness than before, which has been a relative disadvantage of OLED TVs to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5qGwo"&gt;LG Display is a components manufacturer and doesn’t release consumer products itself, so it’s unclear who’s actually going to put a 42-inch TV on sale this year. The larger LG Electronics company is yet to fully unveil its 2021 range of OLED TVs, but &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210110001100320"&gt;according to a report in Yonhap&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll be using “OLED evo” branding for the new panels in its 2021 “G1” series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbSF5k"&gt;LG Display has already made news at this year’s virtual CES, announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223774/lg-transparent-oled-tv-display-55-inch-smart-bed-ces-2021"&gt;“Smart Bed” concept&lt;/a&gt; with a transparent OLED panel that rises out of the foot, along with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223753/lg-flexible-gaming-tv-bend-oled-flat-curved"&gt;48-inch flexible panel&lt;/a&gt; that can shift from a flatscreen TV into a curved gaming monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Elite Dragonfly laptops come with Intel’s 11th Gen processors and 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qv2gkpDWNSp4lCqiLATFQsIvxPQ=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68647661/HP_Elite_Dragonfly_Max_Dragonfly_Blue_Workspace_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP’s new Elite Dragonfly Max laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpszPV"&gt;HP is refreshing its business-focused Elite Dragonfly range this year with an updated G2 model and a new Dragonfly Max option. Both laptops will include Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors, and optional 5G connectivity. The Max model even improves the built-in webcam, and adds a second black color option for the range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SifBO3"&gt;Both the 13.3-inch Dragonfly G2 and Dragonfly Max will ship with 11th Gen Intel processors, with the i3 only available on the G2 and i5 and i7 processor options available on both. Both can also be configured up to 32GB of RAM and up to 2TB of M.2 SSD storage space. Both models will also include a single USB 3.1 charging port, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, a single HDMI 1.4b port, and Nano SIM support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpQokb5Hr0VPIxr9E3z5Wg-SVqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22225948/HP_Elite_Dragonfly_Max_Front_Right.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new black option for the HP Elite Dragonfly Max.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v9zYh4VlWegRcIlW5Pt0E2AHn0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22225949/HP_Elite_Dragonfly_Max_Rear_Left.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the HP Elite Dragonfly Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PByBFd"&gt;Where the models really differ is in display configurations and webcams. The Dragonfly Max will only be available with a 13.3-inch HD (1920 x 1080) display, while you can configure the Dragonfly G2 with HD or 4K panels. Both will still include options for HP’s privacy-oriented screen that includes technology to tint the screen so that people passing by can’t snoop on what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5o8Y8"&gt;The Dragonfly Max will also include a 5-megapixel webcam, up from the 1.2-megapixel one found on the G2. It’s an essential change in an era of remote working where traditional laptop webcams are often falling short. The Max also has four wide-array microphones for better video and audio calls, and keeps the dedicated webcam privacy slider found on last year’s Dragonfly laptops. HP has removed this manual slider on the G2 this year, and replaced it with a button on the keyboard that activates the webcam shutter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IqisRoWfrsfKa_6cWHNRhHFXSNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22225950/HP_Elite_Dragonfly_G2_Workspace_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam privacy button on HP’s Elite Dragonfly G2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I0NHA5"&gt;Both the Dragonfly G2 and Max will include 5G options, with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile networks supported in the US. HP is also keeping the built-in Tile tracker it introduced with the 2020 models. You can track the laptop just like any other Tile device, as long as it has some battery life left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JZoon"&gt;HP says it expects both the Dragonfly G2 and Max to be available in January, but the company isn’t announcing pricing details just yet. Given the base model of the 2020 Dragonfly G2 was $1,500, this year’s models are bound to be pricey options for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler CEO says even his lawyers are abandoning him</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter Alternative Banned From App Store And Google Play" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bMgvskFm8nf2xD_oxTB3gyv50cc=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68647523/1230524287.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByZt79"&gt;The CEO of the conservative-friendly social app Parler said that all of its vendors have abandoned the company following recent bans from Google, Apple, and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyrbkE"&gt;“Every vendor, from text message services to email providers to our lawyers, all ditched us too, on the same day,” Parler CEO John Matze said in an interview with Fox News &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6221679825001#sp=show-clips"&gt;on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lPzL9"&gt;Google banned Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon has informed Parler it will be kicked from the company’s web hosting services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Sunday evening&lt;/a&gt;. Each company cited threats of violence posted on Parler in their reasons for removing the app. Screenshots from the app shared by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220366/apple-google-parler-pressure-deplatform-violence-capitol"&gt;activist group Sleeping Giants&lt;/a&gt; showed users calling for violence against Mike Pence and threatening further activity at the Capitol on January 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpcyqN"&gt;In a post on Saturday night, Matze said that the service “will be unavailable on the internet for up to a week as we rebuild from scratch” and that “we have many competing for our business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adWDtX"&gt;But in Sunday’s interview, Matze said that it was having difficulties finding a new vendor to work with. “We’re going to try our best to get back online as quickly as possible, but we’re having a lot of trouble because every vendor we talk to says they won’t work with us. Because if Apple doesn’t approve and Google doesn’t approve, then they won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DaLxO2"&gt;LG Display has shared video of its new 48-inch OLED gaming TV that can bend from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212808/lg-display-48-inch-bendable-oled-tv-gaming-vibrate-sound-cso-technology"&gt;flat display to a curved one&lt;/a&gt; with the push of a button, and seeing it in motion is fascinating. Check it out at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfmOJd"&gt;The flexible display orientations could let you watch TV with the flat orientation and play games with the curved one, for example. The company’s video also shows off how the screen could be used for a racing game with a first-person perspective in the cockpit, which seems like another practical use of a flexible TV to me. If you prefer to play racing games with a flat screen, you can keep the TV that way or opt to curve it if you find that more immersive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dvy6I"&gt;The TV can bend up to a radius of 1,000mm, has up to a 120Hz refresh rate, and offers a variable refresh rate ranging from 40Hz to 120Hz. It also has LG’s Cinematic Sound OLED (CSO) technology, which vibrates the display to create sound in lieu of speakers. LG has shown off similar technology before with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/10/14222986/sony-bravia-oled-lg-display-ces-2017"&gt;prototype TVs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18224394/lg-g8-thinq-oled-speaker-quad-dac-boombox"&gt;last year’s LG G8&lt;/a&gt;, but since CES is virtual this year, we can’t personally vouch for how well the CSO technology actually works in this new display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfL0Du"&gt;If you just want to watch the screen change from flat to curved and back again, we made this hypnotic GIF for you. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG imagines a bed with a hidden see-thru OLED TV set</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CANKI2NGgpDAKLe0aQ5TT9H-tnk=/21x0:620x399/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68647377/lg_bed_tv_smaller.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p4Rasb"&gt;LG Display is continuing its trend of reimagining the future of screens at CES 2021 with a new transparent TV. The panel is a 55-inch OLED, but its transparent design lets you see through it even when it’s turned on and displaying an image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YECIGc"&gt;The screen achieves 40 percent transparency, LG Display says, which is an improvement over past transparent LCDs the company claims achieved only 10 percent transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QoyoRtPUoAZdLnq99dcH18nRwuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226322/lg_bed_tv_smaller.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3VoG3v"&gt;LG imagines the screen sitting at the foot of a bed, where it can rise up partially or in full to show information or videos while retaining a view of the other side of the screen. The panel as it’s designed now has built-in speakers, though it’s unclear precisely what audio features they will support. In an email the company said that its “Sound Solution technology” is “embedded in the frame.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4J4lx"&gt;LG says the transparent OLED set can also be moved around the home if you’d like to position it somewhere else (if it were something you could actually buy, which you cannot right now). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SU9TEzswoaSEj5R1UjyY--GZ_NE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226286/Screen_Shot_2021_01_10_at_4.55.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG Display has designed its first prototype of the 55-inch transparent OLED to sit at the foot of a bed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp2HIX"&gt;The company sees this as both a smart home device and one that could one day be used in public settings, like in restaurants and on public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gbyYT"&gt;“Transparent OLED is a technology that maximizes the advantages of OLED and can be used in various places in our daily lives, from stores, shopping malls, and architectural interiors to autonomous vehicles, subway trains, and aircraft,” Jong-sun Park, LG Display’s senior vice president and head of commercial business, said in a statement. “It will grow into a next-generation display that can change the existing display paradigm.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ue8-fkGtLKK8d4R2rHIv_XZl4lI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226280/Screen_Shot_2021_01_10_at_4.50.38_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG Display imagines its transparent OLED display outside the home, as both a subway window and display in a public transportation setting. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pCIXrM"&gt;This isn’t the first transparent display to make a debut at CES; we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/10/8756355/samsung-transparent-mirror-oled-displays"&gt;Samsung’s transparent OLED screens before&lt;/a&gt;, and Panasonic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10733626/panasonic-transparent-screen-display-ces-2016"&gt;showed off a prototype transparent display back in 2016&lt;/a&gt; (though it was only HD). And it’s not even LG’s first transparent OLED — the company announced last month it’s started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158335/lg-assa-abloy-automatic-sliding-doors-transparent-oled-displays"&gt;developing see-through OLED sliding doors&lt;/a&gt; for office buildings and commercial spaces. LG also created a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/22/15851994/lg-flexible-transparent-oled-display"&gt;77-inch curved transparent OLED back in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that it imagined could be used for signage or advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBa9dA"&gt;But this is LG Display’s first screen of this type it’s made strictly as a TV that would actually go in someone’s home, and not just something you’d see in a futuristic shopping center or some other commercial venue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54oP9b"&gt;This is just one of many in a long line of LG Display experimental prototypes, some of which do indeed become real products you can buy. The company has made waves at past CES showcases with various iterations of its rollable OLED technology, while a commercial version of the TV using the tech finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;went on sale in South Korea in October of last year&lt;/a&gt; for an eye-popping $87,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ef2aLK"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no indication right now that LG’s new transparent OLED TV will become a real product at some point in the future or how much it might cost if it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhEXs4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 9:10pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; the original version of this article stated that the display supported LG Display’s Cinematic Sound OLED (CSO) technology. That is not the case and the article has been updated. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Locked Down, Supernova, Losing Alice and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9x2PLzyePPgRp-fp7_M55YKCMI=/249x0:1559x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68646979/lockd_donwn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor and Anne Hathaway star in Locked Down | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mepeWor5JPk&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9nKl7i"&gt;So with all the chaos of the past week, you may have missed that Friday was the final episode of Jeopardy! with Alex Trebek as host. Trebek, who died in November at age 80 after a battle with cancer, hosted the answer-and-question game show for 37 years. The show posted a best-of highlight reel of Trebek’s performances over the years (remember the brouhaha when he shaved his mustache?!) and it may make you tear up a bit. My favorite appreciation of Trebek was from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/arts/television/alex-trebek-jeopardy.html"&gt;James Poniewozik in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which concludes: “He was our trusted man with the answers, even in times when reality came to us in the form of a question.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCCKAb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arsStQAhHVA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SMqPc8"&gt;Out new trailers this week range from dark and creepy to quirky to unsettling (which, to be totally honest, I prefer all of the above to syrupy holiday movies). Let’s go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bT4tGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="siXO2q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zfSw7G1A-0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nPRlag"&gt;Losing Alice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="B6zDpi"&gt;A movie director fretting about her age meets a mysterious screenwriter on a train, and the two are drawn into a weird relationship. Love a good noir movie. Losing Alice was written and directed by Sigal Avin. Ayelet Zurer and Lihi Kornowski star in the eight-episode streaming series which premieres on Apple TV Plus January 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8SO7io"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mepeWor5JPk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0UP4au"&gt;Locked Down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve2uUN"&gt;Look I just love Anne Hathaway so I’m willing to give anything she’s in at least a chance. A couple quarantining together during the pandemic just after they decide to break up, meh, OK. But &lt;em&gt;plot twist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;they also plan a jewelry heist at Harrod’s department store to steal a bazillion-dollar diamond. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I’m on board. Chiwetel Ejiofor (another fave) also stars in&lt;em&gt; Locked Down&lt;/em&gt;, which hits HBO Max January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EwnqT0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_62BeXxd_jo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jIFZHK"&gt;Derek DelGaudio’s In &amp;amp; Of Itself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DttZwT"&gt;What is this weirdness about? Put simply, it’s a one-man show by Derek DelGuadio, who describes himself as a “storyteller and conceptual magician.” &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/in-of-itself-review-derek-delgaudio-frank-oz-sxsw-1202217981/"&gt;IndieWire’s review&lt;/a&gt; says it’s a blend of “stage trickery and alluring autobiographical asides,” that’s also a “meditation on existential yearning.” Hey I’m down for whatever. Directed by Frank Oz and produced by Steven Colbert (yep and yep!), &lt;em&gt;In &amp;amp; of Itself&lt;/em&gt; hits Hulu January 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KgvaOq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRz2hY6ykGE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Cowg3v"&gt;Supernova&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QbpC9g"&gt;Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth star as a partners of 20 years traveling across England to visit family and friends. It’s not just a beautiful road trip movie, though; Tucci’s character Tusker has dementia and is slowly losing his memory, so the pair are acutely aware of the value of the time they have left together. &lt;em&gt;Supernova&lt;/em&gt; is slated to hit theaters January 29th, with a “digital release” February 16th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is hosting an encore performance of the Ratatouille musical </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rb_Sz9I8AibI98c9DJK2TM3XvTs=/44x0:607x375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68646442/Seaview_Work_Featured_Images_Ratatouille_650x375.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J2nxDh"&gt;The Ratatouille TikTok musical will return for an encore performance Sunday night on the platform where it all started. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-ratatouille-the-musical-makes-it-to-broadway-and-streams-on-tiktok"&gt;TikTok is hosting&lt;/a&gt; another showing of the streaming musical that debuted online New Year’s Day, which has already raised more than $1 million for The Actors Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnB7jp"&gt;The musical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;came together on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; over the past few months, with composers, fans, set designers, costumers, and choreographers creating musical numbers for the fictional “show” which is built around the 2007 Disney/Pixar animated film. Then in December &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;Seaview Productions announced&lt;/a&gt; it was producing the show in association with TikTok.  Disney/Pixar gave its blessing, and the show attracted big Broadway names to perform the crowdsourced songs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMgXoq"&gt;Wayne Brady plays Django, Andrew Barth Feldman plays Linguini, Ashley Park nearly steals the show as Colette, Andre de Shields plays Anton Ego, Adam Lambert is Emile, and Tituss Burgess stars as Remy, the rat with a taste for fine cuisine. The 20-piece Broadway Sinfonietta orchestra provided the score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrqtNE"&gt;The show drew mostly strong reviews from theater critics; the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/theater/ratatouille-tiktok-musical-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; called it a “silly, multilayered delight” and the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-01-02/tiktok-ratatouille-musical-theater"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;said it showed what the future of musical theater could look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPYTh4"&gt;The encore will stream live on TikTok at 8PM ET, and viewers can donate to The Actors Fund via an in-app donation sticker, TikTok says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Use of Clearview AI facial recognition tech spiked as law enforcement seeks to identify Capitol mob</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ELECTION-TRUMP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pJuDusLJzrxLitlvBxQljb_PVM=/31x0:5124x3395/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68646140/1230505415.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hb0kA9"&gt;Clearview AI’s CEO says that use of his company’s facial recognition technology among law enforcement spiked 26 percent the day after a mob of pro-Trump rioters attacked the US Capitol. First reported &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/09/us/trump-biden#facial-recognition-clearview-capitol"&gt;by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hoan Ton-That confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Clearview saw a sharp increase in use on January 7th, compared to its usual weekday search volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiHK1L"&gt;The January 6th attack was broadcast live on cable news, and captured in hundreds of images and live streams that showed the faces of rioters breaching the Capitol building. The FBI and other agencies have asked for the public’s help to identify participants. According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, the Miami Police Department is using Clearview to identify some of the rioters, sending possible matches to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. And &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported that an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/local-police-force-uses-facial-recognition-to-identify-capitol-riot-suspects-11610164393"&gt;Alabama police department was also using Clearview&lt;/a&gt; to identify faces in images from the riot and sending information to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0Vtld"&gt;Unlike other facial recognition used by authorities, which use images such as driver’s license photos and mug shot photos, Clearview’s database of some 3 billion images was scraped from social media and other websites, as revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation last year&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;raising serious concerns about privacy&lt;/a&gt;, the practice of taking images from social media violated the platforms’ rules, and tech companies sent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;numerous cease and desist orders to Clearview&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2Ia4f"&gt;Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that while facial recognition tech is not regulated by federal law, &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;its potential for mass surveillance of communities of color have rightly led state and local governments across the country to ban its use by law enforcement.” Wessler argued that if use of the technology by police departments is normalized, “we know who it will be used against most: members of Black and Brown communities who already suffer under a racist criminal enforcement system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aSWL0"&gt;Clearview AI said in May it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stop selling its technology to private companies&lt;/a&gt; and instead provide it for use by law enforcement only.  Some 2,400 law enforcement agencies across the US use Clearview’s software, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
