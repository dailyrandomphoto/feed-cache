  &lt;p&gt;Follow the white rabbit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lTsr3c"&gt;It’s the end of year two of the pandemic and many of us staying inside — both to avoid the spread of new variants like Omicron and to avoid the unpredictable weather of 2021. Whether you’re new to HBO Max or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679296/hbo-max-discount-6-months-deal"&gt;signed up earlier for the half-priced deal&lt;/a&gt; but haven’t opened the app in a while, this is a particularly good month to check out the platform. HBO Max is streaming some of the hottest movies that are being simultaneously released in theaters (if you’ve subscribed to the ad-free tier), so you can enjoy them from the comfort and safety of your own home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYrelg"&gt;I hope you have your favorite snacks and drinks ready because here are 11 movies and shows that are worth watching right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kQnzpw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OkCa6N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="VrTnpb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tqzzy45-_g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="quOnF1"&gt;This highly anticipated fourth installment of The Matrix franchise brings stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss back into the Matrix — but this time, Neo and Trinity don’t seem to know each other. Thanks to the new Morpheus (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Lawrence Fishburne) offering Neo a red pill to bring him back to a new version of the Matrix, Neo ends up joining the resistance to fight a new enemy. Directed by Lana Wachowski, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; was simultaneously released on HBO Max and in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22847124/the-matrix-resurrections-release-date-time-hbo-max-streaming-december-22nd"&gt;starting December 22nd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re planning the watch the streaming version, don’t wait too long — you’ve got (&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeBestHBOMax2021&amp;amp;aff_unique1=https://www.hbomax.com/the-matrix-resurrections-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;) 31 days to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ZOyIs8"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DwV1Pz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Trilogy: The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Matrix Trilogy" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6y3DOg_Thn2vmc6co6C3xLTnoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084063/617987_the_matrix_gCreditWBPictures.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MqshO4"&gt;Before you start watching &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, you should really fall down the rabbit hole and (re-)watch the complete &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;. The original &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; (1999) follows hacker Thomas Anderson / Neo (Keanu Reeves) as he discovers the truth about the virtual reality world he and fellow humans have been trapped in, a world created by artificial intelligence overlords in the shape of Agent Smith. Written and directed by Lana and Lilly Wachowski, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; changed how slow-motion action sequences are filmed with “bullet time” and is responsible for such iconic cultural references as red pill / blue pill and lines like “There is no spoon.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmpdT9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; (2003) takes place six months after the events of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, where a rogue Agent Smith infiltrates Bane, one of the rebel ship’s crew. Meanwhile, Zion is expecting an attack by the A.I.-powered Sentinels within about 72 hours, and it’s up to Neo as The One to decide the fate of Trinity and the human race. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwf2T1"&gt;In the conclusion to the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Revolutions&lt;/em&gt; (2003), the humans in Zion go to war against the machines. As the rogue Agent Smith attempts to conquer both the Matrix and the real world, it’s up to Neo to thwart his plans. Who will succeed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0nA79G"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u4bF8l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="EUWM2u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kevqiiYNFrc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5cY9A"&gt;Part family drama and part dark comedy, &lt;em&gt;Succession &lt;/em&gt;centers around the fictional media and entertainment mogul Logan Roy as his health declines and he figures out who among his children (or outsiders) has the chops to take over his billion-dollar company. It’s an expletive-filled, modern take on William Shakespeare’s &lt;em&gt;King Lear:&lt;/em&gt; the Roy kids vie for their narcissistic parents’ affection and trust while they (and everyone around them) play games within games. The show just wrapped its third season with a masterful season finale (it has been &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/succession"&gt;renewed for a fourth season&lt;/a&gt;), so you can go binge all three seasons to see what all those Succession-memes are about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MCoS0h"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cTMqdN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;8-Bit Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="rmWEj5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CI-YWRK0VPo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EAteSD"&gt;Need a new Christmas movie to love? &lt;em&gt;8-Bit Christmas&lt;/em&gt; (2021) is a hilarious and wholesome reminder of how much your Christmas present meant to your 10-year-old self. Jake Doyle (played by Neil Patrick Harris) regales his daughter with a story on how he and his friends, who lived in a working-class suburb in 1988 Illinois, tried to get the Nintendo Entertainment System for Christmas. Whether you have your heart set on a red-headed Cabbage Patch doll or the still elusive PlayStation 5, we can all relate to the trials and tribulations of trying to get that present we’ve been dreaming of and not knowing if Santa will get the job done on Christmas Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yWWJXr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uPVsZW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Heights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="qP8qca"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlY-HzJ0kno?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="33bSSw"&gt;As the first blockbuster movie that was released this past summer (after vaccines became more widely available), the movie musical &lt;em&gt;In the Heights&lt;/em&gt; (2021) did not get as big a box office as hoped, but you can watch it on repeat to learn all the songs or choreography. Adapted from the Broadway musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, with a screenplay written by Quiara Alegria Hudes, the movie weaves modern Latino immigrant stories, along with their hopes and dreams, into a great soundtrack full of hip hop and Latin beats. Directed by Jon M. Chu and choreographed by Christopher Scott, the team behind the iconic &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/des3dpKtfIM"&gt;Microsoft Surface “Movement” commercials&lt;/a&gt;, the choreography is crisp and shows off diverse styles, ranging from mambo to ballet, particularly in “96,000” — the Busby Berkeley-esque extravaganza at the swimming pool. I dare you not to sing or couch-dance along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ABhf4S"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DISFVn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="Ja0OPg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTxJlwRL0V4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLpxgv"&gt;Jean Smart deserves all the awards she gets, like the Emmy she won for portraying diva comedian Deborah Vance in &lt;em&gt;Hacks &lt;/em&gt;this year. Just as her Las Vegas show makes plans to reduce the number of her appearances per week (and therefore her paycheck), Deborah finds herself working with a Gen-Z comedy writer named Ava who can’t do anything right. Through some brilliant writing that is darkly funny and yet feels all too real, the two find they can grudgingly learn from each other and create a more authentic show for Deborah. It’ll be interesting to see where this show goes in season two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vxGkQL"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sL8fVG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nora from Queens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="KKkKB0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jrsjTp07mqA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nPacBL"&gt;When I was feeling extremely homesick during the first lockdown, my howling laughter from watching season one of &lt;em&gt;Nora from Queens&lt;/em&gt; really brought me a little closer to my family. Co-written and developed by Awkwafina (&lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; Nora Lum), the show is loosely based on the actress’s own family: she was brought up by her Chinese American grandmother because her Korean mother passed away when she was young. The show breaks the model minority myth that all Asian Americans are over-achievers and highlights some of the intra-racial tensions within the Asian American community. When an app created by Nora and her cousin Edmund (played by SNL’s Bowen Yang) gets bought up by a Chinese tech company, the show really demonstrates what it’s capable of. Both seasons one and two are available on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rbIb9O"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OnDg7T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raised by Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="lW76RE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAg6RTQEfeM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qi5zdl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raised by Wolves&lt;/em&gt; (2020) is a horror sci-fi show that makes you question who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Directed and executive produced by Ridley Scott for its first two episodes, the show starts off by introducing you to two androids called Father and Mother, who crash land on the desolate Kepler-22b planet and birth some human babies. They seem like a loving family until an accident forces them to cross paths with a group of human missionaries who are very suspicious of the androids. That’s when the audience realizes the two groups have been at war with each other for some time and are hungry for revenge. Created by Aaron Guzikowski, there is a strong sense of foreboding in this world, but you just can’t turn away — good thing this show has already been renewed for season two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="shtZ3O"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWsbLm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="JHl2QC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/igVXQT4HrEo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AmyIGV"&gt;I had no idea HBO Max offers the entire Studio Ghibli library on HBO Max (I always assumed it would be on Disney Plus). Known for its environmentally conscious messages, beautifully hand-drawn animations, and strong female characters, the Hayao Miyazaki-led Japanese studio has something for everyone. &lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt; (1988) is my personal favorite: you experience the world through the eyes of the sisters Satsuki and Mei as they befriend the forest spirits in their new home. Miyazaki manages to capture the feelings of growing up so perfectly that I feel like I just fell into the rabbit hole of my own childhood every time I re-watch this classic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6klV2PCPB0Mqn4BStUqvzqjC8U=/0x342:6144x4438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310067/51412207042_d9b9722df0_6k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An anxiety-ridden launch that’s been decades in the making&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DGbXyU"&gt;On Christmas Day, NASA is gifting astronomers one of the greatest presents it can give by launching the most powerful space telescope ever created. Called the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, the space observatory is meant to be the successor to NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope already in orbit around Earth. And it promises to completely transform the way we study the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDFHHq"&gt;Sporting the biggest mirror of any space-bound telescope ever launched, JWST is tasked with collecting infrared light from some of the most distant stars and galaxies in the Universe. With this capability, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789561/nasa-jwst-james-webb-space-telescope-priorities-astronomy-astrophysics-exoplanets"&gt;the telescope will be able to peer far back in time&lt;/a&gt;, imaging some of the earliest objects to have formed just after the Big Bang. On top of that, it will unravel the mysteries of supermassive black holes, distant alien worlds, stellar explosions, dark matter, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PFJvpY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it will unravel the mysteries of supermassive black holes, distant alien worlds, stellar explosions, dark matter, and more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BKWRjg"&gt;NASA has worked for nearly three decades to craft this telescope and get it to the launchpad. Now, the telescope is finally set to launch on top of a European Ariane 5 rocket out of Europe’s primary launch site in Kourou, French Guiana in South America, on Saturday, December 25th. But once the telescope is in space, there’s still a long way to go. Because JWST is so massive, it must fly to space folded up. Once in space, it will undergo a complex unfurling process that will take up to two weeks to complete. And this reverse origami must go exactly right for the telescope to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5d1e9"&gt;All the while, JWST will be traveling to an extra cold spot located 1 million miles from Earth, where the spacecraft will live out its life, collecting as much infrared light as it can. It’s an extremely complicated launch and mission, with many opportunities for things to go wrong along the way. But if everything goes &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, the world’s astronomers will have an unbelievably powerful tool at their disposal for the next five to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3DmEm"&gt;Read on to learn more about one of NASA’s most important launches of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="04Zoif"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impressive Specs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XHs9mQ"&gt;The first thing to know about JWST is it’s massive. The telescope sports a light-collecting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;mirror that’s more than 21 feet, or 6.5 meters, wide. For comparison, Hubble’s mirror is just under 8 feet, or 2.4 meters, across, and it’s been responsible for imaging some of the most iconic objects we’ve ever seen in the Universe. Thanks to its larger mirror, JWST will be between 10 and 100 times more sensitive than Hubble, allowing it to spot very faint objects in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfwmDv"&gt;“You can sort of think of a telescope mirror like a light bucket,” Amber Straughn, the deputy project scientist for JWST at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The bigger the mirror, or the bigger the bucket, the more stuff you collect. And of course, in this case, the stuff is photons light from the distant Universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gHDQOn99voFfgdKJEPNGNy6TD4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119939/50113128506_77faa0a8f4_o.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Northrop Grumman&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JWST’s primary mirror being undergoes testing at  Northrop Grumman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EXMYya"&gt;To assemble this massive mirror, JWST’s engineers had to build it in pieces. It’s made out of 18 hexagonal segments of the lightweight element beryllium, each one roughly the size of a coffee table. Together, the segments must align almost perfectly, moving so precisely they are aligned within a fraction of a wavelength of light, which is about 1/10,000th the diameter of a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLl1Id"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Each mirror has to match the other mirrors to a very small tolerance so that when they are aligned, they act as though they were a single mirror,” Lee Feinberg, the optical telescope element manager for JWST at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a23xfp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they act as though they were a single mirror”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GPKzkg"&gt;One key feature of the mirror is that it is coated in a layer of gold about 200 times thinner than the average human hair. The gold is what allows JWST to see in the infrared — a type of light that is associated with some of the most distant galaxies and stars in the cosmos. Because the Universe is expanding, the farthest objects away from Earth are speeding away much more rapidly than objects that are nearer to us. The faster they sprint away, the more their light gets stretched, shifting away from the visible part of the spectrum and toward the infrared. With its gold mirrors, JWST should be able to see the infrared light from galaxies that are up to 13.6 billion light-years away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7HeEV"&gt;And that’s what makes the telescope a window into the past. Light from objects 13.6 billion light-years away will have taken that many years to reach the telescope’s mirror. Since we think the Universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old, that means these objects were around just 100 to 250 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbpUlq"&gt;However, observing in the infrared is incredibly tough. Infrared light is associated with heat, which is emitted by everything with a temperature above absolute zero. JWST can’t live in our planet’s orbit or anywhere on the ground; the heat from Earth and its atmosphere would disrupt the observations. Even the telescope itself needs to be extra cold so that it doesn’t produce too much heat and throw off its own observations. That’s why JWST is being sent to a place 1 million miles from our world, known as a Lagrange point between the Earth and the Sun, where the pull of gravity and centrifugal forces are just right for the telescope to remain in a stable orbit. At this Lagrange point, JWST will stay at more or less the same distance and position from Earth at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LwwEWEJ_jg2zDK5crOsHcmpKtOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119953/STScI_01F6QXZP80QG7SNS3M7YZWDNN3.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="udfAvR"&gt;Even at this faraway distance, heat from the Sun is still an issue. To stay extra cool, JWST is equipped with what is known as a sunshield. It’s made up of five ultra-thin layers of a material called Kapton, each the size of a tennis court stacked on top of each other. The outermost layer will always face the Sun and reflect most of its heat, operating at a scorching 230 degrees Fahrenheit. But each successive layer will be cooler and cooler so that JWST’s instruments stay nice and cryogenic, operating at about minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MWzH39"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Troubled History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KzJ3WN"&gt;JWST’s journey to the launchpad has been long and bumpy. After years of discussion about what the next major space telescope after Hubble should look like, astronomers at &lt;a href="https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/news/newsletters/_documents/2016-volume033-issue01.pdf"&gt;the Space Telescope Science Institute formally recommended in 1996&lt;/a&gt; that NASA build a new infrared space telescope with a mirror 4 meters wide. But NASA’s administrator at the time, Dan Goldin, decided 4 meters was not big enough and called on mission designers to increase the size to more than 8 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LxkXW"&gt;This decision made building the spacecraft way more complex. The massive mirror meant that JWST had to launch folded up since no rocket available was big enough to house the spacecraft in its final configuration. And the truth was the technologies needed to make the telescope a reality — such as the system and mechanics needed to perfectly align those mirrors — still needed to be invented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX1dqc"&gt;“The next stumble was that it’s way more expensive than we thought,” Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="W1X3ud"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s way more expensive than we thought”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh5sCk"&gt;Initially, astronomers hoped to launch JWST sometime between 2007 and 2011, for an &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-224.pdf"&gt;estimated cost of anywhere from $1 billion to $3.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. But over the decades, JWST’s costs continued to grow, while its launch date was pushed back and back. Eventually, lawmakers proposed canceling the project altogether over the snowballing budget. NASA then did a complete re-plan of the mission in 2011, and Congress agreed to continue funding the project while placing a budgetary cap on the telescope’s total life of $8.8 billion. A new launch date was set for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8oI9y3ZXW5ADr6pIe2YIAZ6lkko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119959/50068963377_8f522e0307_o.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPZTFc"&gt;But costs continued to increase while development stalled. Meanwhile, as engineers began piecing the telescope together and testing it to get ready for space, there were all sorts of issues. While the telescope was at Northrop Grumman, the primary contractor for the spacecraft, screws and washers seemingly came off the vehicle at one point, engineers found tears in the sunshield, and someone applied excessive voltage during a test, to name just a few errors. Eventually, in 2018,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;NASA settled on a final cost for the program: &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-406.pdf"&gt;a whopping $9.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; to cover both development and the spacecraft’s operations in space. The agency also admitted that it wouldn’t be launching that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNXrud"&gt;New controversies arose over JWST&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;during the telescope’s final stretch. Earlier this year, a group of astronomers raised concerns about the telescope’s namesake, James Webb, a NASA administrator during the Apollo program who oversaw the United States’ ambitious plan to put people on the Moon. &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-needs-to-rename-the-james-webb-space-telescope/"&gt;In an article published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, three astronomers called on NASA to rename the telescope, citing the fact that Webb was a high-ranking civil servant in the Truman administration during the Lavender Scare — when LGBTQ individuals were targeted and purged from the federal workforce. Ultimately, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02678-1"&gt;decided not to rename the telescope&lt;/a&gt; after doing its own internal investigation and claiming it could not find evidence that Webb had been involved. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/james-webb-space-telescope-nasa-controversy/620445/"&gt;the investigation&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was criticized for not going deep enough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bxAOXn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; mistakes that are small on Webb that have small consequences. You have to be near perfection.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iBBpAs"&gt;With its controversial name still intact, JWST was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722559/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-arrives-kourou-french-guiana-launch"&gt;finally shipped to its launch site in French Guiana in October&lt;/a&gt;. On brand, its woes did not stop when it arrived in South America. The telescope’s launch was originally set for December 18th but was delayed twice due to a couple of mishaps, including a broken clamp band that sent unexpected vibrations through the telescope and an unforeseen communications issue between the rocket and its ground systems. The clamp issue was resolved, but the latter is still ongoing — though NASA claims it should not be an issue for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFgNPb"&gt;As Zurbuchen explains, every precaution has to be taken when a problem arises, no matter how small of an issue it might seem. The spacecraft has taken so long and cost so much to build that everything has to go right. Otherwise, the risk is a $10 billion telescope that’s dead in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfxHum"&gt;“Small mistakes... the vast majority of them have small consequences,” says Zurbuchen. “There are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; mistakes that are small on Webb that have small consequences. You have to be near perfection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PIVvPh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch Is Just The Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="pEVE8A"&gt;As of now, JWST is set to launch on December 25th at 7:20AM ET. Its ride to space, the Ariane 5 rocket, has been Europe’s premier rocket for roughly the last two decades. In addition to being a highly capable rocket with a strong launch record, the selection of Ariane 5 also brings NASA’s European partners into what is considered a truly global mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zo40f9"&gt;The launch itself should last roughly 26 minutes before JWST separates from the Ariane 5 rocket. While rocketing to space is always risky, there’s more anxiety to come when JWST is actually free from the Ariane 5. “Launch is really only the beginning,” says Straughn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LGNSUI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Launch is really only the beginning.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vxFEjY"&gt;If all goes well with JWST’s takeoff, that’s when the “29 days on the edge” — a term coined by NASA — begins. It’s an ominous phrase to describe the telescope’s complicated unfurling process. Once freed from the rocket and en route to its destination 1 million miles from Earth, the spacecraft will slowly unfurl and blossom like a mechanical flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8cenP"&gt;The first thing JWST must do right after launch is deploy its solar panel to start gathering energy from the Sun needed to power the entire spacecraft. During its next day in space, it’ll deploy its high-gain antenna needed to communicate with Earth. After that, the really wild reverse origami begins. JWST will change its shape and start to deploy its delicate sunshield, a process that is set to last for days. If that goes well, then the telescope will fully deploy its primary mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="MaCp4e"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzGLKQ7_KZQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pf6ezU"&gt;Even when the unfurling is done after about two weeks, JWST won’t be at its final destination — it’ll still have weeks to go. A little less than a month out from launch, the telescope will fire its onboard thrusters to put itself into its final position at its intended Lagrange point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIub4u"&gt;Needless to say, a lot of astronomers, engineers, and scientists won’t be getting much rest until the entire thing is over. And there are plenty of moments where one failed pulley or one sticky actuator could jeopardize the future of the entire mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zjfzle"&gt;But if everything goes right, then NASA will soon have some incredibly sharp eyes in the sky. The telescope will have to spend some time cooling down when it reaches its final orbit, and then engineers will need some months to test out all the instruments to see if they work properly. But JWST could be taking its very first breathtaking images as soon as this summer. For astronomers, the wait will be well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FGVoSM"&gt;“I really do think that this telescope will be transformational for astrophysics,” says Straughn. “I think that we will learn things about the Universe that completely surprise us, and that’s one of the most exciting prospects about any time we put a big, bold telescope like this into space. We learn things that we never expected.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt as former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in new TV show teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95BhSIWJr-xGUUrzxonc867LcB4=/54x0:629x383/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70309822/joseph_gordon_levitt_uber_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WotIgz"&gt;Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pumped. In fact, he’s &lt;em&gt;super pumped&lt;/em&gt;, taking on the role of former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in a &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/super-pumped-showtime-premiere-date-trailer-series-joseph-gordon-levitt-1234879912/"&gt;limited series from Showtime&lt;/a&gt; that debuts February 27th, 2022 and will chart the chaotic rise of the transportation startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiLW7b"&gt;The show is titled &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt; after the best-selling non-fiction book of the same name from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist Mike Isaac. It’s been developed by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, co-creators of &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt;, a series which revels in the pugnacious behavior of the super-rich. There’ll be lots of familiar material for Koppelman and Levien in Kalanick’s story, then, with the former CEO described aptly in the trailer as “the notorious bad boy of tech” (those words spoken by Uma Thurman, who’s playing Arianna Huffington, co-founder of &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, in the show).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="In7RJ4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is a case study of ingenuity and insanity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WU1AKJ"&gt;“The story of Uber is rich in plot twists, one-of-a-kind personalities and important implications for corporate America,” Jana Winograde, president of entertainment at Showtime said &lt;a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/super-pumped-battle-uber-limited-180037187.html"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; when plans for the series were announced. “It is a case study of ingenuity and insanity, and there are no writers better suited than Brian and David to explore this business and the people who drive it, literally and metaphorically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnKtg6"&gt;Each season of &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt; will chart a different story from the world of business, with the first season, &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber&lt;/em&gt;, focusing on Uber and Kalanick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujILhD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa is nagging you more because Amazon knows you don’t care about its new features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GTjizxsQ6eD2vd9q6vTG3Ayf3n0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70309773/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“By the way, I’m much more than just a voice-activated timer.” &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FwXgXD"&gt;If you regularly use an Alexa device, you’ve probably been upsold by Amazon’s assistant at some point. Ask Alexa to carry out some basic task like setting a timer, and it will finish its response with a cheery “By the way, did you know I could [insert feature you’ve never heard of here].” As highlighted in a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/amazon-s-voice-controlled-smart-speaker-alexa-can-t-hold-customer-interest-docs"&gt;recent report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is because Amazon knows that users aren’t really getting stuck into the full range of Alexa’s capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKXf1A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report is based on internal Amazon docs, and features some interesting statistics about Alexa usage. Here are the ones we found most eye-catching: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1GFYmv"&gt;In 2020, Amazon determined that 25 percent of US households have at least one Alexa device, with this rising to 27 percent for Amazon Prime customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NyN5wv"&gt;Christmas is when a lot of customers buy new Alexa devices, but keeping people engaged can be tough. Per &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt; Amazon found in some years that 15 percent to 25 percent of new Alexa devices were no longer active by just the second week of use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uwBC1C"&gt;Last year, Amazon concluded that the market for smart speakers had “passed its growth phase,” and estimated it would expand only 1.2 percent annually in future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OSYVvt"&gt;In 2018, Amazon projected that it would lose $5 on average per Alexa device sold, and that by 2028 it oped this would be $2-per-unit profit. The company mainly wants to generate revenue from Alexa devices by using them to direct people to other Amazon services. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Yj4mKc"&gt;Alexa devices with screens are used more. 74 percent of users who have an Alexa device with a screen use it weekly, compared to 66 percent of Echo users, and 56 percent of Echo dot owners. That suggests a problem with discoverability and usability for voice interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uzpzxF"&gt;In a planning doc from 2019, Amazon noted that Alexa users discover half of all the features they will ever use within three hours of activating a new device. For most users there are just three main use-cases: playing music, setting timers, and controlling lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5BBucG"&gt;Taken all together, these statistics don’t paint the rosiest picture for Alexa’s future. Yes, it’s true that Amazon’s digital assistant is incredibly well-known and has enviable market penetration, but it looks like limited user engagement and poor discoverability for new functions mean that interest (and therefore potential profit) might have plateaued. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52qcaVTJJuylmVFpvbe1zQqLics=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086560/jtuohy_211207_4924_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has been launched more Alexa devices with screens in recent years, like the Echo Show 15. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dIw92W"&gt;This is something we’ve noted before at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In 2019, on the fifth anniversary of Alexa’s launch, I lamented the fact that despite years of development, my Echo devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951178/amazon-alexa-echo-launch-anniversary-age-funtionality-not-changed-use-cases"&gt;weren’t any more useful than they had been in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Like the users Amazon highlighted in its internal docs, I mostly stuck to music, timers, and other basic tasks. I’ve tried out more advanced functions, but they’re generally disappointing. And indeed, earlier this year I switched from an Alexa smart speaker to a Siri one (which annoys me in different ways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzYsKy"&gt;Amazon, of course, refutes the idea that Alexa has stalled. “The assertion that Alexa growth is slowing is not accurate,” Amazon spokesperson Kinley Pearsall told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “The fact is that Alexa continues to grow — we see increases in customer usage, and Alexa is used in more households around the world than ever before.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XqEBY"&gt;But this is a relatively vague statement that could contain some flattering elisions. Alexa’s business is still growing, yes, but how much of that is due to the assistant being used in new product categories, like cars and earphones? If that’s the case, does it suggest the core smart speaker business is struggling? And is the Alexa department as a whole growing fast enough to actually deliver profits for Amazon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07DvFg"&gt;It’s impossible to answer these questions with confidence, but every time Alexa interrupts a user to advertise an unloved, unheard-of feature, it feels like a tiny loss for the platform’s future. If you want to limit those suggestions, we recommend &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/amazon-echo-how-to-turn-off-alexas-unwanted-by-the-way-suggestions/"&gt;this guide here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s foldable P50 Pocket has a circular external screen that’s perfect for notifications</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2r9KRAtEARGT9IwY60Xq2WlNQTM=/124x0:2739x1743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70309517/p506.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EH5xiH"&gt;Huawei has officially announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Fphones%2Fp50-pocket&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F23%2F22851418%2Fhuawei-pocket-p50-foldable-clamshell-phone-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the P50 Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, a clamshell-style folding smartphone that has a circular, 1-inch external display for quick access to notifications and widgets. The device launches in China today, though US sanctions (which mean Huawei can’t use key tech like Google’s Android OS) mean the P50 Pocket won’t make any impact in the West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMMsBM"&gt;Huawei teased the handset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839272/huawei-p50-pocket-china-launch-foldable"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; with a photoshoot focused on the P50 Pocket Premium Edition that appeared in &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/em&gt;. This version of the device was created with Dutch designer Iris van Herpen. It has a gold or silver finish, and a 3D pattern on the exterior surface that’s typical of van Herpen’s work, resembling feathers or leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZnpQqv8bdX5y4Me07SYC-pn_P8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122379/p502.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket is Huawei’s third foldable phone, but its first to use a clamshell design. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WLi0VCf1hOreTzv04EivhQW9nMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122378/p501.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s sales pitch for the P50 Pocket focuses, not surprisingly, on the pocketability of the device. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MzESqC"&gt;When unfolded, the Pocket’s OLED screen is 6.9-inches in size, with a 21:9 ratio and 120Hz refresh rate. The device weighs 190 grams and is just 7.2mm thick (Huawei compared it to the iPhone 13 Pro Max which weighs 238 grams and is 7.65mm thick). It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 4G SoC, a 4,000mAh battery, and runs Huawei’s Harmony OS 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k7eIF"&gt;The P50 Pocket’s main camera array has a 40-megapixel main sensor, 13-megapixel wide angle lens, and 32-megapixel “super spectrum” lens which Huawei says captures a greater range of color. There’s a hole-punch camera built into the main display, but Huawei notes that the phone’s foldable design makes it more convenient to use the main camera for taking selfies, with the 1-inch cover screen doubling up as a viewfinder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9KPIbU0IcXVyJQQ3L9nDbzJyl8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122383/p504.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket’s external circular screen can be used to display various apps and widgets. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lu5WI0pBGnM_IZZYlNYhtrZO8TY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122381/p503.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessing basic information like turn-by-turn directions can be done more discreetly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uLWOkA"&gt;Huawei is positioning that same “cover screen” as a big part of the P50 Pocket’s appeal. As well as showing notifications or the time, the screen can be used for widgets, letting users control music, follow directions, and so on. So, for example, if you’re using your phone to navigate in a new city, the cover screen will show discreet, turn-by-turn directions, rather than forcing you to open up the large 6.9-inch main display to check your position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSKqfK"&gt;The P50 Pocket also has a new hinge which leaves zero gap between the screens when folded. This compares favorably to devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3, which is another clamshell but has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;slight tapering gap&lt;/a&gt; when folded. The P50 Pocket also has face unlock on both the main and cover screen, and a side-mounted fingerprint unlock sensor — handy when many people are still commonly wearing masks during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jMEc9EYobXdJb8o4syzjAciVbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122384/p505.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket folds completely flat, while Samsung’s Z Flip 3 has a slight tapering gap. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="REh8E1"&gt;A standard edition of the P50 Pocket has gone on sale in China today with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for ¥8,988 (around $1,400), while the premium version, with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, sells for ¥10,988 (around $1,700). The standard edition is available in black and white, while the premium edition comes in silver or gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CpHWSx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtVSM_JMy-A?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2O7V6v"&gt;During a presentation, the CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group, Richard Yu said the clamshell design offered a more refined take on folding devices. “It’s very delicate and exquisite,” said Yu. “We want to bring elegance to you, on the go.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First super fast PCIe 5.0 SSDs teased ahead of CES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiagRDQv7UkTidaOs6pQwvK6GHA=/89x0:1411x881/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70309471/xpg_ddr5_adata_ssd.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adata teases first PCIe 5.0 NVMe M.2 SSDs.&lt;/em&gt; | image: Adata&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pAbzJV"&gt;Samsung and Adata are both teasing PCIe 5.0 SSDs ahead of January’s big CES event. With read/write speeds up to 14/12 GBps, this new generation of solid state storage is essentially twice as fast as the fastest PCIe 4.0 drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOpoAs"&gt;Adata &lt;a href="https://www.adata.com/en/news/960"&gt;teased two prototypes&lt;/a&gt; of its first PCIe 5.0 NVMe M.2 SSDs with capacities up to 8TB. The so-called Project Nighthawk SSD is designed using a Silicon Motion SM2508 controller capable of sequential read/write speeds up to 14/12GBps, while the Project Blackbird SSD features an InnoGrit IG5666 controller for 14/10GBps read/write speeds. Adata will hopefully provide more details at CES which begins January 5th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;unless COVID derails it again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDvTcXhq1z9mYOxcVsQrmhHr7c8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122351/PCIe_5.0_SSD_main2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s targeting enterprise servers with the PCIe 5.0 PM1743 SSD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThA8Sh"&gt;Samsung, meanwhile, just announced the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-develops-high-performance-pcie-5-0-ssd-for-enterprise-servers"&gt;PM1743 PCIe NVMe SSD&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with Samsung’s 6th gen v-NAND and a proprietary controller that supports the PCIe 5.0 interface. The company is targeting enterprise customers with the promise of 30 percent enhanced power efficiency and advanced security features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHdotN"&gt;The PM1743 is capable of sequential read speeds of up to 13GBps (random read speed of 2,500K IOPS) and sequential write speeds of 6.6GBps (random write speed of 250K IOPS), according to Samsung. The PM1743 SSD will be available in capacities ranging from 1.92TB to 15.36TB, and is currently being sampled by chipset and server manufacturers prior to mass production in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 seemingly falling apart: Lenovo joins T-Mobile, Amazon, AT&amp;T and others in bailing out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, appears to be in jeopardy due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On Wednesday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well, and despite CES organizers’ statements today that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;So far, T-Mobile has been the most prominent exhibitor to bail. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to Axios’ Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. Intel also appears to be reconsidering as of Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5tzXmA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CES UPDATE: After closely monitoring the current trends surrounding COVID, it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and our communities to suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;— Lenovo Stories &amp;amp; News (@LenovoNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LenovoNews/status/1473824084018360321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced this week that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But T-Mobile was the first major attendee to bail, with companies like Twitter and even Meta having a far more muted presence at the show in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jLod2S"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms, rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgCexR"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung and GM, which have featured keynotes like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic and Sony. Intel typically rents a lot of prominent space as well, but this year their huge booth appears to be MIA, replaced by Canon, Razer, and other smaller companies. “We are currently revisiting our plans for CES and will provide an update as soon as possible,” an Intel rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend as of Tuesday, and LG said Tuesday that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that AMD and Samsung are still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus and HTC still plan to attend. Sony, Samsung and Google are all listed as “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On Tuesday morning, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;As of Wednesday, the CTA says it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations, but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZhLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:09 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Amazon and LG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P8sia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information about AT&amp;amp;T, Intel, and a statement from the CTA, which organizes CES each year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVBWcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 9:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple closes several stores due to COVID-19 outbreaks, encourages online shopping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shoppers Look For Deals On Black Friday As Supply Crunch Continues" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clMsKdWX7vFx77vQVUQsKKlccx4=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70308820/1236819472.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Octavio Jones/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CqIkwu"&gt;Over the last couple of weeks, several Apple Stores around the US have closed due to rising COVID-19 infections among staff members, and a report by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/apple-shuts-at-least-seven-stores-since-tuesday-amid-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lists seven locations in the US and Canada that have shut down operations within the last day or so. The Apple Stores listed include Dadeland and The Gardens Mall in Florida, Lenox Square in Atlanta, GA, Highland Village in Houston, TX, Summit Mall in Ohio, Pheasant Lane in New Hampshire, and Sainte-Catherine in Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eC4kij"&gt;According to the report, shutdowns are usually called when 10 percent of the store’s staff has tested positive. These spikes are occurring as the &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; omicron has become the dominant strain of the virus spreading throughout the US. Apple’s response to the changing conditions has included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;reinstating its mask policy&lt;/a&gt; and delaying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838471/apple-delays-office-reopening-date-covid-19"&gt;plans to resume office working for all of its worker&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pilBx4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/22/apple-store-free-two-hour-delivery/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out one other item people should be aware of, which is that Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/shipping-pickup"&gt;begun promoting two-hour deliveries in “most metro areas” for free&lt;/a&gt;. The promotion says it will run through noon on Christmas Eve, and while it’s convenient for anyone on a last-minute gift mission, it could also help reduce crowds inside of stores during the shopping rush. That’s in addition to other options like In-store/express/curbside pickup and next-day delivery for many items.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Display brought a reclining curved OLED throne to CES this year</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0rFSYx"&gt;Would it even &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a tech tradeshow without a new throne? 2020 brought us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435361/scorpion-chair-gaming-cockpit-office-wfh"&gt;the scorpion chair&lt;/a&gt;, 2019 gave us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170575/kohler-konnect-bathroom-smart-gadgets-numi-intelligent-toilet-ces-2019"&gt;the “fully-immersive” toilet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/30/17799330/acer-predator-thronos-gaming-chair-hands-on-ifa-2018"&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-smart-mask-oled-gaming-chair-193027315.html"&gt;encase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848822/acer-predator-thronos-air-gaming-chair-price-release-date-ifa-2019"&gt;gamers&lt;/a&gt; in their own PCs have been a thing as long as I’ve been on the beat. But LG Display has a new, more elegant take on the idea: a rotating curved 55-inch OLED TV attached to a reclining slice of chair that positions you at the sweet spot of those pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ialdy1"&gt;Like most of LG Display’s ideas, the “Media Chair” is a concept, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a product — at least for now. LG Display tells us it’s actually working with an unnamed Korean massage chair company to bring it to market someday. “It’s being commercialized by them, they’re going to sell it,” spokesperson Matthew Weigand tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5iqo72OaHsVF2qBuMKzT5zH7Fp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121823/LG_Display_Media_Chair_at_CES_2022__2_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG Display’s Media Chair concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zSllCF"&gt;But while there aren’t integrated robotic massagers quite yet, the concept &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a lot of vibration going on — speakers in the chair, and a speaker in the form of the OLED panel itself, thanks to LG Display’s Cinematic Sound OLED (CSO) tech that vibrates the screen to produce audio. (We’ve covered that tech &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/10/14222986/sony-bravia-oled-lg-display-ces-2017"&gt;since 2017&lt;/a&gt; for TVs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18224394/lg-g8-thinq-oled-speaker-quad-dac-boombox"&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt;, and it also appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223753/lg-flexible-gaming-tv-bend-oled-flat-curved"&gt;LG Display’s concept screen that bends from curved to flat&lt;/a&gt; last year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbVvjv"&gt;As for the TV, it’s a 55-inch OLED panel with a 1500R curve, which offers the “perfect focal distance away from a person so they can get an optimal viewing experience,” says Weigand.  (We haven’t seen it for ourselves yet.) It can also rotate between portrait and landscape modes; you press a button on the touchscreen control panel on the right armrest to do so. Since it’s attached to the chair’s frame, the TV also stays in your sightline as you recline the entire chair.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2JQYgcCG_hpNlH1KyS82Hme7Cs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121747/LG_Display_Media_Chair_at_CES_2022__4_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yvyYgm"&gt;I don’t think there’s any question that such a thing would be far, far out of my price range, though there’s always a chance that some of the concept’s benefits might trickle down someday. After all, LG’s consumer-grade OLED sets have recently come down below the $1,000 mark, and while remarkably expensive, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866060/lg-display-rollable-oled-tv-65-inch-ces-2018"&gt;its eye-popping rollable display concepts&lt;/a&gt; did finally make their way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577063/lg-oled-r-rollable-tv-us-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;into a $100,000 TV&lt;/a&gt; that even managed to arrive stateside this past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1oOkyB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG imagines a bed with a hidden see-thru OLED TV set","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223774/lg-transparent-oled-tv-display-55-inch-smart-bed-ces-2021"},{"title":"Watch this flexible LG gaming TV bend from flat to curved","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223753/lg-flexible-gaming-tv-bend-oled-flat-curved"},{"title":"This 65-inch OLED TV rolls up like a giant newspaper","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/9/16866060/lg-display-rollable-oled-tv-65-inch-ces-2018"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m9iw7"&gt;The Media Chair isn’t the only concept LG Display is showing off at CES: it’s also got the “Virtual Ride,” which uses &lt;em&gt;three &lt;/em&gt;55-inch curved 4K OLED screens to create a single giant wrap-overhead display to theoretically feel like you’re cycling outdoors. In addition to being a showpiece, LG Display is also pitching it as a potential alternative to VR headsets, though obviously it’d be a little more convincing if it had some 3D depth. Or perhaps additional screens that wrap around the sides, instead of just vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj9049"&gt;What might impress you is the curve: the top screen has one portion that curves to a radius of just 500 millimeters (500R), which LG Display says is the tightest bend we’ve seen from a large display. For context, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 monitor I reviewed last year&lt;/a&gt; has a 1000R curve, and that was the state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZ-jWKOqh9LjBoevAM3uCO4ZPMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121827/LG_Display_Virtual_Ride_at_CES_2022__5_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG Display&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG Display’s Virtual Ride concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F7NzxG"&gt;What I hope we get out of this is more curved screens, to be honest. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/30/14439362/samsung-curved-tv-review-un40k6250af-mistake"&gt;While a curved TV might be a mistake for a household&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in a bright room, I wound up wishing LG offered a curved OLED gaming monitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv#comments"&gt;when I reviewed its 48-inch TV&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, just for productivity’s sake. Done properly, that’s something I could see paying for, unlike a TV throne for one or a cycling station.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s AWS logs third outage this month, affecting Slack, Epic Games Store, Asana and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcfUAN03InB_0UTKa7CYDLIq97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305351/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuvhOy"&gt;Amazon’s crucial web services business AWS has experienced problems today due to a power outage, affecting services like Slack, Imgur, and the Epic Games store for some users. It’s not looking good if you’re working from home, with some Slack users unable to view or upload images and work management tool Asana also hit by the outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ6o2o"&gt;The official &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS service health dashboard&lt;/a&gt; blamed the issues on power outages in a single data center, affecting one Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) within the US-EAST-1 Region. At 9:13AM ET, Amazon said it had &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22613821%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Ddash.parsely.com%5Bd%5DD"&gt;restored power&lt;/a&gt; to the affected servers, and by 12:28PM ET, it had “restored underlying connectivity to the majority of the remaining” systems. However, users may still be experiencing issues as services and servers are relaunched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL3VsZ"&gt;At 7:22PM ET, just over twelve hours after the problem began, Amazon marked the issue resolved. However, that restoration didn’t necessarily fix everything for all of the servers affected. The final AWS status page update explains Amazon’s issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fvARAf"&gt; Starting at 4:11 AM PST some EC2 instances and EBS volumes experienced a loss of power in a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region. Instances in other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, and other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region were not affected by this event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRNoED"&gt;At 4:55 AM PDT, power was restored to EC2 instances and EBS volumes in the affected data center, which allowed the majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes to recover. However, due to the nature of the power event, some of the underlying hardware experienced failures, which needed to be resolved by engineers within the facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhAUhh"&gt;Engineers worked to recover the remaining EC2 instances and EBS volumes affected by the issue. By 2:30 PM PST, we recovered the vast majority of EC2 instances and EBS volumes. However, some of the affected EC2 instances and EBS volumes were running on hardware that has been affected by the loss of power and is not recoverable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxHaPA"&gt;For customers still waiting for recovery of a specific EC2 instance or EBS volume, we recommend that you relaunch the instance or recreate the volume from a snapshot for full recovery. If you need further assistance, please contact AWS Support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jMi62F"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-12/a17eae991fdc437d"&gt;incident update&lt;/a&gt; at the peak of the outage, Slack said its services were “experiencing issues with file uploads, message editing, and other services.” Asana said the problems constituted a “&lt;a href="https://status.asana.com/incidents/xm08pc5v6mlk"&gt;major outage&lt;/a&gt;,” with “many of our users unable to access Asana.” Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1473644098632441860"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “Internet services outages” were “affecting logins, library, purchases, etc.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGWCSv"&gt;Of the affected services, it appears that they are largely back online, even as Amazon’s restoration continues. A &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-12-22"&gt;Slack page tracking the connection issues&lt;/a&gt; marked the problem resolved around 3:13PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJBnzJ"&gt;It’s the third time in as many weeks that problems with AWS have had a significant effect on online services. Two incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837637/aws-west-is-down-twitch-outage-amazon"&gt;involving AWS&lt;/a&gt; ended up knocking out a huge array of platforms and products, taking out streaming sites like Netflix and Disney Plus, as well as smart home devices like security cameras from Ring and Wyze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gT4U31"&gt;Today’s outages seem less widespread but still notable, with some users unable to access services entirely and others merely experiencing intermittent faults. &lt;a href="http://DownDetector.com"&gt;DownDetector.com&lt;/a&gt; shows reports of issues with the platforms mentioned above, as well as news aggregator Flipboard, online learning site Udemy, dating app Grindr, streaming service Hulu, and IoT services from Honeywell, Life360, and Samsung’s SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXYy5u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Wednesday, December 22nd, 7:48PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with latest from AWS noting the problem as resolved. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
