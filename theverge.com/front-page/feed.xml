    <title>Sony posts and deletes ad featuring an upside-down PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_zF-G9jBg5KVjM-bnY4gZeVqpao=/0x54:753x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69558149/AykaCvG__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t think that’s how it’s supposed to look.&lt;/em&gt; | Image via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ogaleu/humor_sony_ad_has_the_ps5_upside_down_at_the_26/h4hw4gp/" target="_blank"&gt;u/madhouse5625 on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hTsBPf"&gt;The PS5 is a strange-looking console, and its curved edges can make it difficult to know exactly which way the console should sit when it’s laid down flat. In the significant majority of Sony’s marketing, when the console is shown on its side, &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-console.3005816"&gt;the disc drive is on the bottom&lt;/a&gt;. But rather hilariously, it seems that even Sony can get confused about which way it’s supposed to go, as it released a video on its main Twitter account showing the console lying down with the disc drive &lt;em&gt;on top &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-pulls-ad-featuring-upside-down-ps5-1847253801?utm_campaign=Kotaku&amp;amp;utm_content=1625769052&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIidx3"&gt;The video has already been deleted, but thankfully, a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ogaleu/humor_sony_ad_has_the_ps5_upside_down_at_the_26/h4hw4gp/"&gt;Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/tJIwfLW"&gt;a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of how the PS5 appeared in the ad, nestled into someone’s home entertainment system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/URs4Sq5BcnE8eQUTNq0yXCU15kY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706714/AykaCvG__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ogaleu/humor_sony_ad_has_the_ps5_upside_down_at_the_26/h4hw4gp/" target="_blank"&gt;u/madhouse5625 on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upside-down PS5 in Sony’s ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YXmsyj"&gt;The embarrassing blunder hit shortly before Sony is set to air &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/06/tune-in-to-state-of-play-this-thursday-for-an-extended-look-at-deathloop/"&gt;a State of Play showcase about upcoming PS5 games&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at 5PM ET on Thursday. But as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reminded me, this isn’t even the first time Sony has messed up the orientation of the console: PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst tweeted a video &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/even-the-head-of-playstation-studios-has-his-ps5-upside-1845873681"&gt;with an upside-down PS5&lt;/a&gt; in December that he then deleted and re-uploaded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1338077877489774592"&gt;but with the PS5 cropped out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5FDEF"&gt;Personally, I keep my PS5 set up vertically. That way, I avoid any confusion about how it should or shouldn’t be set up. But I have to say I still haven’t gotten over the way it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438782/sony-ps5-size-specs-dimensions-console-huge-large-big"&gt;towers over my other consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXjxgG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: We incorrectly spelled Hermen Hulst’s first name, which has two Es, not one. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s ‘big blue app’ leader, Fidji Simo, is leaving to take over Instacart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Internet Companies Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-L6u9bVvzEusfAcYsjUzQshfks=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69558131/1233805336.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki / NurPhoto / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JgHElx"&gt;The online grocery startup Instacart &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Fcompany%2Fpressreleases%2Finstacart-appoints-board-member-fidji-simo-to-chief-executive-officer-and-announces-founder-and-current-ceo-apoorva-mehta-will-serve-as-executive-chairman-of-the-board%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568621%2Ffacebook-big-blue-app-leader-fidji-simo-instacart-ceo" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its new CEO will take over on August 2nd. Fidji Simo has been in charge of Facebook’s “&lt;a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/can-facebook-innovate-a-conversation-with-mark-zuckerberg/"&gt;big blue app&lt;/a&gt;” since 2019, putting her in charge of “News Feed, Stories, Groups, Video, Marketplace, Gaming, News, Dating and Ads,” but now, &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-s-facebook-hiring-program"&gt;like a number of former Facebook execs recently&lt;/a&gt;, she’s headed to Instacart ahead of its expected IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbKVjb"&gt;Simo’s departure comes at an interesting time for Facebook, as regulators and politicians take aim at Big Tech, with its market dominance and opaque algorithms that control the online experience for billions of people. Facebook has faced criticism over its “pivot to video” and role as a pipeline for bad actors and misinformation, while a memo from Simo last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"&gt;popped up as an example&lt;/a&gt; of how engagement metrics appear to be the most important thing to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook developer conference F8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bb6K9O3D43vUu0orCb56ujSzm2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706742/1140450239.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4FkzO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/facebook-app-replaces-departing-fidji-simo-with-tom-alison"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that she’ll be replaced by Tom Alison, who ran community products including the controversial “Groups” feature, also noting that with this change, all of Facebook’s highest ranking product execs are men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1V29A"&gt;Meanwhile, Facebook’s structure means that Mark Zuckerberg continues to run things as he sees fit without the threat of being replaced or supplanted, no matter who is in charge of the app itself. Earlier Thursday a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article ran — after a warning &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1412797962900578312"&gt;went out to Facebook employees&lt;/a&gt; claiming it may not represent a “nuanced portrait” — &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/business/mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg-facebook.html"&gt;that described&lt;/a&gt; how the relationship between Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg has changed in recent years, with Sandberg’s influence over the company reportedly waning as Zuckerberg controls more of the decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3t9QNL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As we think about the future of food, we believe the way people eat and their relationship with food will fundamentally change over the next decade.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sKjrKd"&gt;At Instacart, Simo takes over a startup &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/instacart-announces-265-million-in-new-funding-from-existing-investors-301238155.html"&gt;recently valued at $39 billion&lt;/a&gt; that is poised to increase headcount and expected to go public soon. In a statement, she says, “As we think about the future of food, we believe the way people eat and their relationship with food will fundamentally change over the next decade. They’ll expect a more convenient experience, the widest selection of food at their fingertips, faster delivery times, increased personalization, and more inspiration. Instacart has an opportunity to deliver all of that for customers, while also becoming an even stronger ally and growth accelerator for retailers and advertisers, and helping create economic opportunities for hundreds of thousands of shoppers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gef9qR"&gt;That doesn’t mean the grocery company is without issues either, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463023/instacart-plans-automation-grocery-shopping-business-model"&gt;incredibly optimistic ideas of automating the workforce&lt;/a&gt;, as well as dark tales of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"&gt;employee treatment&lt;/a&gt; and responses to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242676/instacart-firing-every-union-employee-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;unionization efforts&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ls9tI9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instacart promises a safer way to shop, but workers tell a different story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>League of Legends’ summer event features a visual novel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4mRsXXl--EQZTopKFanPYFGypw=/151x0:1143x661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557823/RotS_Recruit.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z6PCWo"&gt;Riot Games is announcing a big summer event, Sentinels of Light, that will take place across all five of its currently available games: &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;. Each game will receive themed content during the event, but &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; players will get a special treat: they’ll be able to play through a visual novel-style story experience right in the game’s client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9pQl2"&gt;The story experience, called “Rise of the Sentinels,” is intended to be “approachable for everyone,” Thomas Cunningham, a narrative editing manager for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. The idea is that you’ll be able to enjoy it if you’re a new player or if you’re already well-versed in &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; lore.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFowHxkZQLH6-pwwUa0bpzCIsBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705087/RotS_Dialogue.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Riot Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from the upcoming story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aKi5NR"&gt;Here’s a short summary of the story, shared by Riot — it sounds like you’ll be meeting up with a number of familiar faces from the game: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CxJ3HA"&gt;Taking on the character of a rookie Sentinel, players will unveil the mysteries behind Viego’s return and participate in the battle against him with beloved Sentinels like Senna and Lucian, and some new faces joining them like Vayne, Graves, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw3H88"&gt;And if you want to get caught up on what’s happened leading up to Rise of the Sentinels’ story, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAw5aTmf9Og"&gt;check out Riot’s two-minute video summary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UxYnMA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAw5aTmf9Og?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9Jynk"&gt;As for the decision to use the visual novel format for Rise of the Sentinels, “we wanted to give players the chance to build personal relationships with these characters and make meaningful choices, while at the same time feeling like they were a part of something much bigger than themselves,” Cunningham says. “Visual novels are great at those things, especially when it comes to balancing individual player choices with a far-reaching narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0rX08"&gt;The event in &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; runs from July 8th to August 10th, and each chapter should take about five minutes to complete for most players, according to Cunningham. In addition to the story experience, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; players will also be able to check out a new mode called Ultimate Spellbook where they can use a second ultimate ability, likely leading to explosive and action-packed fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyTUIw"&gt;Sentinels of Light will also see the release of a champion across all of the in-universe &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; games during the same event for the first time. Over the span of two weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAX04HWlgSs"&gt;the new champion Akshan&lt;/a&gt; will come to &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and finally to &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ungwiS"&gt;The Rise of the Sentinels visual novel represents Riot’s latest effort to build out the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;universe, which it has also expanded to other mediums. The studio has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"&gt;partnered with Marvel Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a href="https://merch.riotgames.com/en-us/category/comics-and-books/"&gt;comic books&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22515435/arcane-league-of-legends-show-trailer-netflix-geeked"&gt;Netflix series on the way called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02SP0b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 8th, 4:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added detail on Cunningham’s title.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s over: ‘Vax That Thang Up’ is 2021’s song of the summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiK3jyY4XnwEn23Q4RSa3ObdXlo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557697/back_that_thang_jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZhS9I"&gt;BTS’s “Butter” is one smooth song, and “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” might be a monster hit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/9/22376309/lil-nas-x-montero-call-me-by-your-name-lo-fi-remix"&gt;with a sweet lo-fi remix to boot&lt;/a&gt;. But how is anything going to compete for song of the summer now Juvenile has resurrected his 22-year-old smash “Back That Thang Up” as a catchy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; timely vaccine anthem? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw3SgL"&gt;Just in case you don’t remember the 1999 original, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yd5EPk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpQrAbkM3dI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HD69SJ"&gt;The new version atop this post is practically a full-on parody: Juvenile makes it rain vaccine cards instead of cash money, eggplant emoji are out in full force, and it sure sounds like some random dude named Scott is about to luck out. But you know all that already, because you’re already watching the video. Right? Right. My wife couldn’t stop laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIiZ6w"&gt;Last year’s song of the summer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/7/29/21347203/antibodies-song-pandemic-summer-sucession-braun"&gt;was absolutely about sex in the time of COVID&lt;/a&gt; as well. Production values have certainly improved since then, though!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhPGsa"&gt;Massively popular Chinese social platform WeChat quietly deleted the accounts of several LGBTQ groups organized at major Chinese universities, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-wechat-deletes-university-lgbt-accounts-2021-07-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The groups received warnings that they “violated community rules,” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/media-social-media-technology-e4d565c04b5683be1263a2d90befe494"&gt;according to the&lt;em&gt; Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but were not offered further explanation before their accounts were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGRjZG"&gt;The accounts aren’t viewable on WeChat, but users on Weibo (a Chinese analogue to Twitter) &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4656126677223205?"&gt;have collected a list&lt;/a&gt; of the several of the impacted groups, including ones run by students at Tsinghua University and Fudan University, &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/chinese-censors-quietly-deleting-wechat-accounts-run-by-lgbt-groups-2021-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve reached out to WeChat’s owner and operator Tencent for comment on the deleted accounts and what rules the groups may have violated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pwHA5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/08/health/homosexuality-not-an-illness-chinese-say.html"&gt;Homosexuality was removed&lt;/a&gt; from the Chinese Society of Psychiatry’s list of mental disorders in 2001, but that doesn’t mean people with queer identities aren’t still marginalized within the country. WeChat’s central role as more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16721230/wechat-china-app-mini-programs-messaging-electronic-id-system"&gt;a default app used by many in China&lt;/a&gt; makes deleting these accounts a huge roadblock in the way of successful organizing for advocacy groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JR5RO2"&gt;Speaking anonymously to the &lt;em&gt;AP,&lt;/em&gt; one of the now-deleted group’s managers said that they had been encouraged by their university to shut down their page or remove mention of the university prior to WeChat stepping in. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/business/international/china-gay-homosexuality-textbooks-lawsuit.html?campaignId=6WYWY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has also reported&lt;/a&gt; on just how difficult it is to get the textbooks used by Chinese universities to reflect the actual realities of queer life in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stellantis, parent company of Dodge and Jeep, had an ‘EV Day’ and it was extremely weird</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dChjkhcbsfTy7FWLEeUZk4HxnKI=/364x0:1332x645/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557587/Screen_Shot_2021_07_08_at_2.11.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Stellantis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHPIPZ"&gt;Stellantis is not a musical version of &lt;em&gt;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&lt;/em&gt; set in an underwater kingdom, but actually the name of the newly merged Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group, and the fourth largest automaker in the world. The company held an event Thursday to brief investors and media on its electrification strategy, and as befits a company that represents a mishmash of Italian, American, German, and French sensibilities, it was kind of a hot mess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WuluN"&gt;The first indication that things were about to get weird was when Dodge CEO Tim Kuniskis emerged from a thick cloud of smoke produced by the squealing tires of a Dodge Challenger to present his brand’s electrification strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q6gsBq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was kind of a hot mess&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sTfktf"&gt;It was a jarring transition from the previous presenter, the mild mannered Opel CEO Michael Lohscheller, standing next to a one-off &lt;a href="https://www.goldeagle.com/tips-tools/what-is-a-restomod/"&gt;restomod&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36570065/electric-opel-manta-restomod-revealed/"&gt;Opel Manta Model A&lt;/a&gt;. But I’m sure the whiplash was totally intentional. This is Dodge we’re talking about, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/11/15266608/dodge-demon-announced-new-york-auto-show-2017"&gt;maker of the offensively fast Demon&lt;/a&gt;. This is not a company known for its nuance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vA63a6xbp9dUMZ8_tGcMY6VJTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706378/ddoge_ceo.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W7siMA"&gt;Kuniskis’ job was to let Dodge customers know that the company wasn’t going to kowtow to any lame-ass electrification strategy. After all, who would want to buy a muscle car that doesn’t emit thick plumes of toxic pollution into the environment while scaring all your neighbors’ cats with its aggressive engine growl? “Dodge will not sell electric cars,” he declared. “Dodge will sell American muscle.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNSdhD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apparently that was a bit of sleight-of-hand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2werIl"&gt;But apparently that was a bit of sleight-of-hand, because it turns out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568272/dodge-electric-muscle-car-2024-stellantis-ev-day"&gt;Dodge &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;sell an electric car&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little confusing, but I think it’s because Dodge is branding its future EVs as “eMuscle” cars, a hokey bit of branding that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12846440/ford-tough-ford-trucks-ford-tough-ford-tough-truck-ford"&gt;automakers tend to think sounds a lot cooler than it actually does&lt;/a&gt;. As if that wasn’t enough, Kuniskis went on to compare Dodge to a “hammerhead shark [that] has thrived at the top of the food chain.” (Why hammerhead? Why not a great white shark?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGUw44"&gt;Kuniskis then said that Dodge’s new mission would be “to tear up the streets, not the planet,” which brings me to the next bit of cringe from this presentation: the taglines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ilaveJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So here are all the mottos that Stellantis announced for each brand as part of its new “electrification approach…” &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ttMWXIzqB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9ttMWXIzqB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Motor1 (@Motor1com) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Motor1com/status/1413140147399368711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nbDKmk"&gt;Each of Stellantis’ 14 brands is getting a new motto, which range in quality from Jeep’s “Zero Emission Freedom” (sure, fine) to Opel’s “Green is the New Cool” (burn it down, salt the earth so nothing else can grow). Stellantis is a global corporation with thousands of employees and access to some of the world’s most elite market research firms. Which leads me to wonder: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_pvFXbVlt8"&gt;who are the ad wizards who came up with this one?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7J3DmNO6sUDArNvjcivJZK4us4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706470/jeep_drone.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BLu8JA"&gt;Speaking of Jeep, the iconic brand made some significant news today — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568306/jeep-ev-hybrid-wagoneer-wrangler-cherokee-stellantis"&gt;zero-emission models in every category by 2025&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGqKDSp0CFU"&gt;in addition to some news that was just... out there&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently by that same date Jeep is also promising that drones will launch out of your Wrangler, and biometric facial recognition will be used to unlock your vehicle (even though it may not technically have doors to unlock). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CM4Tjm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fully autonomous Jeeps off-roading through the desert?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0TVren"&gt;And by 2030, we’ll have fully autonomous Jeeps off-roading through the desert, which sounds extremely cool but also feels very “CES circa 2016,” when every company was promising fully autonomous everything without any constraints, way before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951385/uber-self-driving-crash-death-reason-ntsb-dcouments"&gt;Uber killed a person&lt;/a&gt; with its self-driving car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3AEZw"&gt;It’s like Jeep hasn’t really been paying attention to the recent news on self-driving cars. We are more than a decade away from starting to see them in any significant number. Even then, the idea of autonomous vehicles that can drive anywhere, under any conditions, may never become a reality. Even Elon Musk, the king of “fake it till you make it,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563751/tesla-elon-musk-full-self-driving-admission-autopilot-crash"&gt;admitted that autonomous vehicles are way harder&lt;/a&gt; than he anticipated! But sure, go off with your driverless Jeep Rubicon in the middle of the desert, without any road markings or anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChpfJQ"&gt;Listen, I’m not trying to rag on Stellantis for getting weird with its EV Day. Other companies have had similar events that have mostly been stuffy and boring, so kudos to Stellantis for shooting its shot. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NxtL-oLm4"&gt;Live every week like it’s shark week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6ptCm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcaA6Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Startup Halo will bring driverless car service to Las Vegas later this year on T-Mobile 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQ4bVX2CCwAEhHYpxBXBIULu4AQ=/0x23:3000x2023/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557369/21CM0192_05_060221_1040v2m_sm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo says it will use remote drivers to operate its vehicles over T-Mobile 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdySA9"&gt;Driverless car startup Halo has announced a new service coming to Las Vegas later this year: a fleet of remotely operated electric vehicles, using T-Mobile’s 5G network. It’s potentially a big step toward fulfilling the promise of 5G remote driver tech, with a significant catch: the cars don’t operate &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; on T-Mobile 5G. While it’s the primary network they’ll use (mid- and low-band 5G, specifically, with LTE as a fallback), they will also rely on other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pWiKV"&gt;The idea is simple enough: Halo employs remote drivers to operate the vehicles, delivering them to waiting customers who then get behind the wheel and take the car to their destination. When the trip has ended, the car moves on to its next pick-up under remote control. Halo is also currently operating test drives with safety drivers in vehicles, which it says it won’t include when the service launches for paying customers. That’s easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xag8xZ"&gt;There’s no shortage of driverless and autonomous vehicle pilot programs in Las Vegas; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Lyft has operated a driverless taxi service&lt;/a&gt; in the city, and more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291682/motional-fully-driverless-autonomous-cars-las-vegas"&gt;Motional has been testing autonomous rides&lt;/a&gt; without a backup driver behind the wheel. Halo’s service is a little different, using a remote driver, along with an “Advanced Safe Stop” mechanism to automatically bring the car to a halt if a hazard is detected. The company says that ultimately it hopes to achieve full autonomy, and that in the meantime its vehicles are designed to “learn” from their human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UW4YRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I took a gamble by riding in a self-driving Lyft in Las Vegas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16860590/self-driving-lyft-las-vegas-ces-2018"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="f66CMo"&gt;Fully remote driverless vehicles have been one of the promises of 5G, and it’s a use case that actually demands the speed and low latency that 5G connectivity is capable of delivering. But in the US, at least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;our networks just haven’t met the bar yet&lt;/a&gt; to make it a reality. This new service is a step in the right direction, but it seems we’re not quite at full 5G remote operation yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zlq7l"&gt;It won’t exactly be a widespread service at first, either. Halo says that it will operate in “urban parts of the Las Vegas Valley” at launch and doesn’t disclose how large of an area it will cover, just that it plans to later expand to more parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phRERG"&gt;Oh, and it’s probably a coincidence, but Las Vegas is also set to be the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;Dish Network’s first 5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; this summer, a venture that T-Mobile is supposed to be helping to facilitate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;per its Sprint acquisition deal&lt;/a&gt;. If T-Mobile’s 5G network can indeed support a fleet of remotely operated vehicles, it’ll be thanks in part to the addition of Sprint’s spectrum. Before we get carried away by the possibilities of driverless cars, let’s spare a thought for the fourth wireless carrier we’re still missing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minimum broadband speeds are likely too low, government watchdog says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1PDE_csNuhYDtnhRI_eyUHVMQc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557295/acastro_170711_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXiy6l"&gt;Since 2015, the Federal Communications Commission has maintained that minimum broadband speed should stay the same: 25 megabits per second for downloading files, and 3 megabits per second for uploading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lE93IU"&gt;Now, a government watchdog is telling the FCC to re-evaluate these rules in &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-494?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=usgao"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;, saying small businesses in 2021 require more bandwidth to effectively run their operations. The report, produced by the Government Accountability Office, also shows examples of small businesses around the country which aren’t even getting the minimum speed required by the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8QqCxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One Vermont inn pays $78 per month for 10 Mbps speeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FY9CW4"&gt;This isn’t the first time the FCC has faced heat over its broadband minimums. Earlier this year a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312065/fcc-highspeed-broadband-service-ajit-pai-bennet-angus-king-rob-portman"&gt;group of senators&lt;/a&gt; called for the agency to raise the bottom limit to 100 Mbps for both download and upload speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urKAgX"&gt;The FCC has basically admitted that it has very little reliable data on whether people are getting the mandated minimum speeds, or access at all. Its broadband coverage maps are based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;self-reported data from internet providers&lt;/a&gt;, who are incentivized to overstate their coverage to shirk regulation. It has attempted to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379848/fcc-speed-test-app-google-apple-download-broadband-maps-coverage"&gt;speed test apps&lt;/a&gt; to get more direct information, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345533/fcc-broadband-data-collection-program-fix-the-internet"&gt;collected complaints&lt;/a&gt; directly from consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdwIWN"&gt;Anonymized data visualized by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; paints a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;much bleaker picture&lt;/a&gt; than the FCC has admitted, with many counties reporting less than 10 percent broadband availability at minimum speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjUlcT"&gt;But the GAO contends that there’s enough evidence to reconsider these rules. Reports from small businesses show that many want a minimum of 100 Mbps download speed, and up to 1 gigabyte per second for offices with dozens of employees. Even Zoom recommends at least 3.8 Mbps of upload speed to make high-definition video calls, which exceeds the federal minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUdbRd"&gt;Business owners also told the GAO that while they might be able to access broadband, it’s expensive and unreliable. One Vermont inn and spa owner said that they pay $78 per month for substandard 10 Mbps speeds, and upgrading to 40 Mbps would cost a prohibitive $335 per month. Others said they had to rely on expensive satellite internet services to have any reliable access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaTCTb"&gt;Raising this minimum benchmark to 100 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up would have long-term effects for people in rural communities who suffer most from these internet deserts, the GAO writes. The change would lower the percentage of rural Americans who are considered to have acceptable broadband coverage from 83 percent to 67 percent, a strong argument that providers need to invest more in rural infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8ahDH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook accidentally lost a piece of its moderation policy for three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="National demonstration in support of the Kurdish people in..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFBbdHUArLJiWj1z92nhHxwnxWE=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69557218/1201232431.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demonstration in Rome in support of freeing Kurdish political leader Abdullah Ocalan.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Matteo Nardone / Pacific Press / LightRocket / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EItjCZ"&gt;Instagram accidentally banned a post criticizing solitary confinement because Facebook had misplaced the policy allowing it, according to a new Facebook Oversight Board (FOB) decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ7pbW"&gt;The semi-independent Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/IG-I9DP23IB"&gt;says the Facebook-owned site should not have removed&lt;/a&gt; a post about Abdullah Öcalan, a founding member of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Facebook designates Öcalan and the PKK “dangerous entities” that users cannot support on its platforms. In January, moderators applied that policy to a message criticizing Öcalan’s imprisonment and solitary confinement — a practice the United Nations has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/17/18305109/solitary-confinement-prison-criminal-justice-reform"&gt;deemed a form of torture&lt;/a&gt; — in a Turkish prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zwcsmr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Board is concerned that specific guidance for moderators ... was lost for three years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Id0BpO"&gt;The user appealed to the Oversight Board, which agreed to examine the case. As it did, Facebook apparently “found that a piece of internal guidance on the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy was ‘inadvertently not transferred’ to a new review system in 2018.” The policy had been developed in 2017 partly because of the debate over Öcalan’s living conditions, and it “allows discussion on the conditions of confinement for individuals designated as dangerous.” But the internal guidance was never made public to Facebook or Instagram users — and Facebook only realized it had dropped out of the moderation guidelines altogether when the user appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdNDAX"&gt;“Had the board not selected this case for review, the guidance would have remained unknown to content moderators, and a significant amount of expression in the public interest would have been removed,” the FOB’s decision states. Facebook declined to comment on whether it considers that assessment accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh5n5X"&gt;“The board is concerned that specific guidance for moderators on an important policy exception was lost for three years,” the FOB’s decision continues. While Facebook restored the post about Öcalan in April, it told the board it was “not technically feasible” to see how many other posts might have been removed because moderators weren’t aware of the exception. “The Board believes that Facebook’s mistake may have led to many other posts being wrongly removed and that Facebook’s transparency reporting is not sufficient to assess whether this type of error reflects a systemic problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Lk7sv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This case demonstrates why public rules are important for users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JNGlFb"&gt;The FOB decision broadly pushes Facebook to make its rules more transparent. “This case demonstrates why public rules are important for users: they not only inform them of what is expected, but also empower them to point out Facebook’s mistakes,” it says. The decision says Facebook is conducting a review of how the policy failed to be transferred, and the FOB has offered a series of further, optional recommendations. They include conducting a review process to see if any other policies were lost, as well as publicly clarifying the limits of its ban on supporting “dangerous individuals and organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V75qkh"&gt;Social networks like Facebook and Instagram often keep parts of their policies secret, saying that releasing totally precise moderation rules lets trolls and other bad actors game the system. However, as the FOB notes, this kind of secrecy on a huge, diffuse service can make miscommunication easier — as it apparently did in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaVTRH"&gt;Luxury carmaker Bentley has &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234"&gt;announced details&lt;/a&gt; about its Flying Spur Hybrid sedan, its second Bentley hybrid, which the company claims is the “most efficient Bentley ever.” Using just the electric motor, Bentley says you’ll be able to drive for more than 40 kilometers (or just under 25 miles), and the company says the car offers a “total driving range” of more than 700 kilometers (just under 435 miles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZSdnl"&gt;The Flying Spur Hybrid will be able to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 4.1 seconds, according to Bentley. That’s slower than what Tesla claims for the Model S Plaid, which it says can go from 0-60 in 1.99 seconds, but that’s a feat that’s only feasible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540154/tesla-model-s-plaid-acceleration-test-conditions"&gt;under very specific conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X4mJc9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXWPt26hiHI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jv4dC3"&gt;Bentley also says the car delivers a total of 536 horsepower and 750NM of torque. You can check out the full specs of the Flying Spur Hybrid on &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234"&gt;Bentley’s press release&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/flying-spur/flying-spur-hybrid.html"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to build your dream hybrid Bentley, &lt;a href="https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/misc/car-configurator.html/models/Flying_Spur/flying_spur_hybrid/navigate/pivot"&gt;check out the configurator&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no pricing yet, but if it’s anything in the range of other Bentleys, you’ll probably have to pay a lot of money for the car.&lt;/p&gt;
