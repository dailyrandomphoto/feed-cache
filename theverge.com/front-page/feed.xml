    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release later this year — and we’ll highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5M7S6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747531561997035408#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $850. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all three colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747532219045612135#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,100, its best price to date. These deals can come and go quickly, though, we expect more to come as the holiday shopping season draws near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The touch bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s geared more toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $120 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,179. The larger, 512GB variant is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,349, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjmE4B"&gt;While there have been rumors throughout the year of a r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/9/22526584/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-2021-youtube-tags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;edesigned MacBook Pro, one with an M1X processor and additional ports&lt;/a&gt;, we might not see it until further into the fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch, mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Windows bootcamp-ready Ice Lake processors, the current scissor-switch keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, the 13-inch model is available in several configurations at Amazon, including one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-10th-Generation-Quad-Core/dp/B08DTPQ9XB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th-gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,999 and one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th-gen Intel Core i5 processor&lt;/a&gt; for $1,700, which is $300 off the list price. You can also pick up the model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage and a 10th-gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; for $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. There are several configurations available with more storage and speedier processors — you can also get the 16-inch model with an Intel Core i9 CPU and 1TB of storage &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FTNGNC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $2,695 at Amaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-512GB-Storage/dp/B081FV1Y57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, for instance — but deals are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $600&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $799&lt;/a&gt;. B&amp;amp;H Photo is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604800-REG%2Fapple_mgnt3ll_a_mac_mini.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;matching Amazon’s current price&lt;/a&gt; for the 512GB model, though, no other retailers are at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix suspends trans employee who tweeted about Dave Chappelle special </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRVfaK15zP4joimNtKX0flxFAao=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69980712/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKBZdc"&gt;Netflix has suspended a trans employee who tweeted about Dave Chappelle’s comedy special &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Closer&lt;/em&gt;. In the stand-up set, which was released on October 5th, Chappelle &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/dave-chappelle-the-closer-comedy-review.html"&gt;doubles down on his jokes about LGBTQ groups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsYwg5"&gt;The next day, Netflix software engineer Terra Field tweeted about Chappelle, writing that the comedian “attacks the trans community, and the very validity of transness” in the special:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gmWqkc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I work at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@netflix&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday we launched another Chappelle special where he attacks the trans community, and the very validity of transness - all while trying to pit us against other marginalized groups. You're going to hear a lot of talk about "offense".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are not offended  &lt;/p&gt;—   Terra Fied   (@RainofTerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YpdJFv"&gt;The tweet thread went viral, quickly spiraling into a conversation about free speech and cancel culture. Netflix then suspended Field, allegedly for trying to attend a meeting she wasn’t invited to, according to people familiar with the matter. Another trans employee is quitting the company over how the special — and Field’s comments — were handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbcyMm"&gt;The special has sparked significant controversy inside Netflix. Shortly after it came out, employees started asking pointed questions about whether or not trans people were included in the decision to air the special and where the company draws a line between commentary and transphobia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrjJCq"&gt;“We repeatedly provide a platform for content that is harmful to the trans community,” wrote a current employee in Netflix’s open Q&amp;amp;A document. “These decisions have a material impact on our business, including harm to our current employees and talent declining to work with us. What is our plan on how we are going to repair this situation in particular?” None of the questions seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked for the special to be taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bxhlax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t do a carbon offset for bigotry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fAhkAM"&gt;On October 8th, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos responded to the questions in an internal email. “It never feels good when people are hurting, especially our colleagues,” he wrote. “You should also be aware that some talent may join third parties in asking us to remove the show in the coming days, which we are not going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZDm6t"&gt;Sarandos also said that Chappelle’s last special, &lt;em&gt;Sticks &amp;amp; Stones&lt;/em&gt;, is Netflix’s “most watched, stickiest, and most award winning stand-up special to date.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVowoJ"&gt;He added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PGXJoI"&gt;Several of you have also asked where we draw the line on hate. We don’t allow titles on Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe &lt;em&gt;The Closer &lt;/em&gt;crosses that line. I recognize, however, that distinguishing between commentary and harm is hard, especially with stand-up comedy which exists to push boundaries. Some people find the art of stand-up to be mean spirited but our members enjoy it, and it’s an important part of our content offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5jqqqr"&gt;The trans employee resource group at Netflix has been meeting with executives for years to try and educate them about the impact of transphobic content, according to a current employee. When Netflix bought the movie &lt;em&gt;Girl&lt;/em&gt;, about a fifteen-year-old ballet dancer preparing for gender confirmation surgery, it sparked multiple internal conversations about cisgender directors creating content about trans people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8WHRB"&gt;Sarandos said that the company’s commitment to inclusion is reflected in titles like &lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Disclosure&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about Hollywood’s impact on the trans community. But one current employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;they were not swayed by the statement. “You can’t do a carbon offset for bigotry,” they said dryly. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamFederFilm/status/1447122238847733761"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure&lt;/em&gt; director Sam Feder also tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Netflix “rented [the documentary] for half of what it cost to make it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRNuuJ"&gt;Netflix has a long history with Dave Chappelle. In 2016, the comedian signed a deal to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13702948/dave-chappelle-netflix-standup-comedy-specials"&gt;create three specials for the platform&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21643473/netflix-dave-chappelle-show-removal-viacomcbs-comedy-central-deal"&gt;Netflix pulled &lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show&lt;/em&gt; from the streaming service&lt;/a&gt; at the comedian’s request. (It then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279727/dave-chappelle-show-back-netflix-comedy-central-beef"&gt;reinstated it in 2021&lt;/a&gt; after Chappelle’s beef with Comedy Central died down.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwEi7B"&gt;But while the comedian’s earlier specials have drawn controversy, Chappelle’s most recent has evoked a much stronger response. &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; has drawn criticism from GLAAD, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/glaad/status/1445870767548231685"&gt;which wrote on Twitter that&lt;/a&gt; “Dave Chappelle’s brand has become synonymous with ridiculing trans people and other marginalized communities.” &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-special-glaad-national-black-justice-coalition-1235082813/"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the National Black Justice Coalition said: “Perpetuating transphobia perpetuates violence. Netflix should immediately pull &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt; from its platform and directly apologize to the transgender community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gU7bUB"&gt;Read Ted Sarandos’ full email below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ftNwwo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10801698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JgL67n"&gt;Netflix declined to comment on the record for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="MFXd1s"&gt;Apple released iOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;on September 20th&lt;/a&gt;, and already updated it once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704524/apple-ios-15-0-1-update-fix-iphone-13-watch-unlock-bug"&gt;to iOS 15.0.1&lt;/a&gt; to fix an issue where people couldn’t use their Apple Watch to unlock their iPhone 13 while wearing a mask. Apple is also testing iOS 15.1 in beta, which currently includes features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686897/ios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713135/iphone-13-camera-features-prores-macro-ios-15-1-beta-3"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro camera features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wa_2Uod8BhL5yZpxdXG9OqwpXuc=/0x699:4194x3495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Frame, Samsung’s art-like QLED TV, is on sale at Amazon right now for $1,398.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with many fall sales taking place, now might be the best time of the year to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the PlayStation and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MLgUIb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reasons. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J 4K TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $700 and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X80J-Inch-Compatibility-KD55X80J/dp/B08QXFT4M9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $698, its best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885F5GMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $775&lt;/a&gt;, though, we’ve seen steeper discounts on the R635 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, both Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 65- and 75-inch variants. Best Buy is offering &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCsX25uZP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 off the 75-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off the 65-inch&lt;/a&gt;, while Amazon is offering &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C67986B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$205 off the 75-inch&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885N17CC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 off the 65-inch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for around $1,400&lt;/a&gt;, $100 less than its regular $1,500 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JD5CqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 55-inch 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Right now, you can pick it up from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $390&lt;/a&gt;, a $160 discount on what is its typical $550 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $470. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at Amazon, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924XSHB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch model for $470&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. You can currently get the 50-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHFX4FV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $101 less than the usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality you can get in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line also supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can currently get it in either a 55- or 65-inch configuration and save up to $300, depending on the size. The popular 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled55bxpua-oled-4k-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $1,300 at LG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCGlWZuP9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, $300 off the normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30 series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,797 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or for a few dollars more at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555068-REG%2Flg_oled65gxpua_gxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model is also available at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-oled-gx-65%2Fp%2F16C-000P-004G0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg for $2,297,&lt;/a&gt; a savings of more than $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio’s 65-inch OLED is a Best Buy exclusive, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748271630959872367#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it now for $1,800&lt;/a&gt;. Although Best’s Buy’s current discount is nowhere near its steepest — in August, it was on sale for $1,500 — it remains one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a 65-inch TV. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8lGs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in four sizes: 48, 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can purchase the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748273201373884122#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $1,300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the 65-inch configuration for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,600 at Costco&lt;/a&gt; through the end of October. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJNcm"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for around $1,500, one of the lowest prices to date on the excellent OLED. You can also pick up the smaller, 48-inch model for around $1,300 at the same retailers (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the 65-, 77-, and 83-inch variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IrDSVn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn523S"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, though, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both offering the 55-inch model for about $1,500, the best price we’ve seen on the stunning QLED. There are also varying discounts available on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YPBJ2T8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3B227H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch configurations&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4gR7Wz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazfit’s long-lasting Zepp OS fitness watches like iPhones and Android equally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsU3gR_NwOHMOC1JgtiLHemO49s=/101x0:1028x618/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69980522/GTR_and_GTS_3_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazfit GTR 3 Pro, GTR 3, and GTS 3 series of Zepp OS-powered fashion fitness watches.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazfit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1QaceP"&gt;Amazfit is launching three new long-lasting smart activity watches today: the Amazfit GTR 3 Pro, priced at $229.99 / €199.99, and the Amazfit GTR 3 and GTS 3, both priced at $179.99 / €149.99. The GTR 3 can go up to 21 days of typical usage before needing a recharge, the company claims, while the GTR 3 Pro and GTS 3 can last for about 12 days. They’ll go even longer if the battery saver modes are enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcPEY2"&gt;Amazfit is the product brand owned by Zepp Health, previously known as Huami, a public company funded by Xiaomi. The Amazfit GTR 3 Pro, GTR 3, and GTS 3 watches all run Zepp OS, which plays nicely with both iOS / Apple Health and Android / Google Fit. They can also sync your health and activity data to Strava, Runkeeper, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AAOVXk-AcUBD0Eb-GWuHpUGVRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22917188/Pasted_Graphic.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazfit GTR 3 Pro, GTR 3, and GTS 3 feature comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kzl6gG"&gt;The GTR 3 Pro is the company’s new flagship fashion fitness watch. It includes Wi-Fi, GPS, 2.3GB of on-board music storage (enough for a few hundred songs), and Bluetooth audio and call support underneath that round 1.45-inch 331ppi OLED touchscreen display. It’s water resistant to a depth of 50 meters, and a new BioTracker 3.0 optical sensor can measure heart rate, blood-oxygen, stress, and respiratory rate in less than 45 seconds with a single tap. The watch can be navigated with a push and a twist of the crown, a push of a second physical button next to that, or via swipes on the touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0A7quU"&gt;The Pro model also features a mic and speaker that can be used to interact with Amazon’s Alexa voice commands when online (in 15 countries/regions and 14 languages). There’s also a built-in voice assistant (in English, Spanish, German, and Chinese) for use when offline, which can be useful for controlling the watch when your hands are too preoccupied with fitnessing. Amazfit says its watches can track over 150 sports, with eight activities recognized automatically to help you avoid forgetting to track common activities like running, walking, swimming, and biking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_dVIX_7j2wVnsAuod_1CcvrKtTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22917508/IMG20211011163952.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazfit GTR 3 Pro review unit with leather strap. Zepp OS lets you orient the buttons on the left or right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C3x1IA"&gt;I’ve been using a GTR 3 Pro running a beta OS and paired to pre-released versions of both the iOS and Android apps. The hardware seems fine: it’s lightweight, looks okay for the price, and the always-on display and general visibility are excellent when used in the gym or at home. I’m not a fan of outdoor visibility in direct sunlight (not a surprise for OLED) even on a display rated for 1,000 nits of brightness. I’m also not enthused by the overly simplistic UX that won’t let me select menu items with a physical button press. Anyone who’s worn a fitness watch knows how difficult it can be to accurately hit a touchscreen target with a sweaty finger that’s bouncing around. But since my review unit is running pre-release beta software, which is fairly buggy and feature incomplete, I’ll have to reserve judgment until later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazfit GTS 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6y8BEvGGx5J5OGYaTGLwTHXqu0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22917177/GTR3_1.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazfit GTR 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WGYGc3"&gt;The long lasting GTR 3 keeps the 450mAh battery of the Pro model but loses the Wi-Fi, music storage, mic, speaker, and Bluetooth audio support and includes a slightly smaller 1.39-inch display. The lightweight GTS 3, meanwhile, still looks like the Apple Watch while maintaining most of the features found on the GTR 3, only in a slim rectangular case with less battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5OzUT"&gt;In the US, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.amazfit.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F11%2F22720549%2Famazfits-zepp-os-gtr-3-pro-gts-3-specs-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$229.99 / €199.99 GTR 3 Pro and $179.99 / €149.99 GTR 3&lt;/a&gt; are available now, but the squarish $179.99 / €149.99 GTS 3 is only listed as “available soon.” All three watches are available now in the &lt;a href="https://uk.amazfit.com"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fde.amazfit.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F11%2F22720549%2Famazfits-zepp-os-gtr-3-pro-gts-3-specs-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://fr.amazfit.com"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://it.amazfit.com"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://es.amazfit.com"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a room, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;We’ve recently seen the latest Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29, and it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $35. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is offering the fourth-gen Dot at full price, will also throw in a three-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum and take $10 off if you buy two, meaning you’d pay $90 instead of $100. There is also a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other information that is available at Amazon for $45, a healthy $15 off the list price. Both the base model and the LED-equipped variant are available 25 percent off at Amazon when you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EVsfiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;The Kids Edition is currently on sale for $40 instead of $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The retail giant is also selling a discounted bundle for $55, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Like the fourth-gen Dot, you can, however, get a 25 percent discount when you trade in a select device at Amazon. Target is also currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal/-/A-80770246/&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22362455%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $20 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $180. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3g4zTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccs5nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 39,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 6 is currently available for $85 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer the first-gen model, the 2019 version is available at the same retailers for $45 (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747625078603978178#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;). Again, Amazon will take 25 percent off of those prices if you trade in an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6d2iBD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is available for full price ($95) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110 through Amazon. Once more, Amazon is also offering a 25 percent discount on each model and bundle if you trade in certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13MP camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;The first-gen Show 8 is currently available for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, however, there are a few discounted bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080p security camera&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $131 instead of $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-gen Echo Show 8 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $130, its full retail price. At Best Buy, however, you can save $50 if you purchase two of them, reducing the bundled price to $210. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle that contains a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blink Mini for $140&lt;/a&gt; or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. If you purchase through Amazon, the 25 percent trade-in discount is also applicable to all generations of the Echo Show 8 as well as the bundles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini security camera for $260. Again, trading in select devices at Amazon can net you 25 percent off on the Echo Show 10 and all aforementioned bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bA0Mnl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qe3Eto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Qus6Ft"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Facebook expands its Live Audio feature to more creators globally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nrt6BGWZcr5QQPirBB1BqZpZNrs=/0x112:890x705/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69980397/live_rooms.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook’s Live Audio rooms feature is expanding globally | Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gK15ig"&gt;Facebook is expanding the Live Audio rooms feature it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;launched in the US in June&lt;/a&gt; to a global audience. In addition to public figures and creators, Facebook is making the feature — a Clubhouse competitor— available to groups as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4YySO"&gt;When it first launched, Live Audio rooms could be created via Facebook’s iOS app; it’s now added the ability to create rooms in its Android app as well. People will now be able to listen to Live Audio Rooms on desktop, but still have to use a mobile app for creation. Within groups, admins can control who enters an audio room, with private and public options available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ES87xp"&gt;The social media giant is also rolling out its Soundbites short-audio feature to more users in the US. Soundbites live in users’ News Feeds; users record a short piece of audio — an anecdote, a joke, a moment of inspiration — in a separate tool within Facebook. CEO Mark &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;Zuckerberg described Soundbites&lt;/a&gt; as similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram’s Reels&lt;/a&gt;, but just for audio. Facebook says the product is still in early stages of development, but has had success among creators using it so far. It will be available to more users in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6DeEilFJCup_LHIBztYP_0_OSws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455069/Soundbites_Audio_Creation_Tool_and_Listening_Side_by_Side.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is also expanding its Soundbites feature&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msaL8U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse"&gt;Facebook finally got into the podcast arena&lt;/a&gt; over the summer, but listening to podcasts on Facebook is still limited to its US audience. The company said in a statement it has plans to expand its podcast offerings to more markets in the future, as part of a “long-term vision in offering a holistic experience that brings together new distribution opportunities, discovery, monetization and social connections for podcasts in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGQlyS"&gt;The company also says it has focused on moderation tools within its social audio experiences, including tools that “proactively and automatically identify harmful content,” and are adapting its processes to moderate audio content that violates Facebook’s community standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF4fob"&gt;How Facebook handles harmful content, of course, has been a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;subject of scrutiny in recent weeks&lt;/a&gt;, after internal documents provided to news outlets by whistleblower Frances Haugen showed the company’s research found its Instagram platform could be toxic for teenagers, particularly girls. Company vice president for global affairs Nick Clegg said over the weekend that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook"&gt;Instagram would introduce features&lt;/a&gt; encouraging users to “take a break” from the platform and to “nudge” them away from content “not conducive to their well-being.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OekAmk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV is adding personalized profiles and watchlists soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XXDrMPrOQgrXy4cNtJ8qdDfZPWI=/116x0:1907x1194/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979446/1._Profiles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="moDeUO"&gt;Google TV is making finding something to watch in a multiuser household a whole lot less chaotic by adding custom profiles, watchlists, and personalized Google Assistant help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62kcT6"&gt;Previously, Google TV supported the ability to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/10050564?hl=en"&gt;sign into multiple Google Accounts&lt;/a&gt; to be able to use services with more than one account. But content suggestions, the watchlist feature, and Google Assistant functionality were all based on the activity of the primary account holder. With personalized profiles, every user’s recommendations, watchlist, and Google Assistant responses will be tailored to their own interests and activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N16W7e"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that profiles will start rolling out next month on Chromecast with Google TV as well as Google TVs from TCL and Sony. To streamline the experience, Google said that any downloaded apps and credentials can be used across different profiles. The company previously introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318824/google-tv-kid-profiles-announced-features-parental-controls"&gt;kids' profiles&lt;/a&gt; on Google TV earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c75f0EHz6vTwVKYk4qoYppbubOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911182/2._Glanceable_cards_in_Ambient_mode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google TV&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4IedT"&gt;After profiles arrive next month, Google will separately introduce “glanceable cards” on ambient mode. When that support arrives, an idle TV can display personalized information like weather, news, and sports stats, among other tailored-to-you information. This screen will also display shortcuts for things like podcasts, music, and photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3grgEw"&gt;Separately, the mobile remote app for Google TV that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688867/google-tv-mobile-remote-android"&gt;launched on Android&lt;/a&gt; last month will soon be available in the Google Home app on Android and iOS, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HMDdI"&gt;Profiles, an updated ambient mode, and expanded support for the virtual Google TV remote — for those times when the couch eats your streaming wand — follows news this week that Google TV added support for Philo in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524794/google-tv-sling-tv-live-integration"&gt;live TV tab&lt;/a&gt;. Previously limited to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675068/youtube-tv-spanish-language-content-expansion"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; ($65 per month) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252810/sling-tv-price-increase-free-dvr-youtube-hulu"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/a&gt; ($35 per month), Philo is now Google TV’s most affordable live TV option and starts at $25 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Burn-in isn’t a huge risk for Nintendo’s Switch OLED, but you can still take precautions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzo1L33x9766grmZuJxGPC7LEfY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979996/DSCF5796.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gKkOC3"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch OLED Model is now available, and even if it’s no Switch Pro, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;a lot to like about it&lt;/a&gt;. But as new owners of the console start enjoying its larger, more vibrant screen, some might also wonder whether they should pay any mind to the classic “risk” of OLED technology: burn-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGgn1t"&gt;In the early days of OLED smartphones, it wasn’t uncommon to find a mistreated demo phone at a carrier or Best Buy that had a ghastly display with home screen icons or a status bar left permanently visible whenever the screen was on. Burn-in could also befall OLED TVs if they were carelessly left on a news channel (with a ticker at the bottom) for many hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIPUn1"&gt;But we’ve come a long way since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cz22A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/nintendo-plans-switch-model-with-bigger-samsung-oled-display"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung Display is supplying the Switch OLED Model’s 7-inch panel, and that’s about the best news you could ask for when it comes to the longevity and reliability of your $350 console’s screen. Samsung has led the evolution of OLED on mobile devices, and while burn-in is still technically &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; on its modern panels, they’re more resistant to it, and software-based mitigations from Samsung, LG, and others have made it less of an issue than ever before. I’ve got an LG CX OLED that shows zero signs of burn-in after a year of pretty extensive playtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSStQH"&gt;But on a video game console with plenty of persistent HUDs and other fixed onscreen icons, it’s worth taking &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; care when playing the Switch OLED Model. Gaming has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/tv-audio-video/what-is-burn-in/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;always been a potential hazard for OLED&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, as long as you use the device in conventional ways and don’t intentionally try to do lasting damage to its display, you should be totally fine — but there are still things to look out for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqoSkV"&gt;Nintendo itself offers some pointers for keeping the Switch’s display looking its best over the long term. In the console’s documentation, the company says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="R8OlMN"&gt;“To minimize the risk of image retention or screen burn-in occurring on the OLED screen, do not turn off the system’s default sleep mode settings and take care to not display the same image on the OLED screen for extended periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iKtvf2"&gt;Image retention can look similar to burn-in — something “sticks” on the screen after it’s supposed to be gone — but isn’t permanent and goes away on its own as you do other things on the console’s display. If you notice it, it’s a good warning sign to jump over to another game for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4Tszx"&gt;Advising customers not to mess with the &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22353/~/how-to-change-the-sleep-mode-settings#DT:t1-q1a3EP:t1-q1a3-c"&gt;sleep mode&lt;/a&gt; defaults is Nintendo’s attempt to ensure the Switch OLED Model won’t be left sitting somewhere on a static screen for hours. Game HUDs are one thing, but even the Switch’s homescreen has a lot of fixed elements. I’d try to avoid letting the console just sit on that screen for lengthy periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DNikv8"&gt;Does the Switch OLED Model have any specific software features to avoid burn-in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d5YxoM"&gt;As far as what we can tell from what Nintendo has told us so far, the answer is no. In settings, there’s no sign of any screen refresher, which is an animation to help eliminate any image retention. Nintendo also didn’t say whether it subtly shifts pixels in the Switch’s UX to avoid potential issues. The only &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22390/~/how-to-activate-screen-burn-in-reduction"&gt;“burn-in protection” item in settings&lt;/a&gt; still applies just to connected TVs; the Switch will dim a TV’s screen after a few minutes of inactivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAi53c"&gt;Nintendo is mostly just encouraging owners of the Switch OLED Model to use the existing auto-brightness and sleep features to prolong the panel’s lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Sq45KW"&gt;Enjoy your Switch OLED Model and don’t sweat burn-in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8e6nxs"&gt;If you’re using the console in normal ways and switching up the games you play, you’ll likely avoid any burn-in problems for a long, long time. You’ll probably face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715467/nintendo-joy-con-drift-never-fixed-switch-oled"&gt;other issues like Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt; long before experiencing any burn-in. The proper Switch Pro might even arrive before you see any screen aberrations. Then again, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701435/nintendo-categorically-denies-4k-switch-pro-development"&gt;maybe not&lt;/a&gt;. The point is that, barring any unforeseen quality defects with the screen (which is unlikely for a Samsung panel), it would take extreme circumstances for burn-in to ruin your console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTuyGI"&gt;But if you’ve got the brightness cranked all the way up, turn off sleep mode, and leave it sitting on a still screen for an entire week, yeah… bad things will probably happen. Use common sense, vary it up, and don’t stress; enjoy the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P7jn1s"&gt;How to avoid burn-in on the Nintendo Switch OLED Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HQ8Uuo"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Watch your brightness.&lt;/strong&gt; Image retention and burn-in could be more likely if you’re always playing at max brightness. You don’t have to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; careful here; I immediately disabled auto brightness on my unit and typically have it in the 75 to 80 percent range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lznOQE"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Vary your games. &lt;/strong&gt;No one’s telling you not to sink hours upon hours into your favorite title. Go for it! But if you want to preserve the OLED Model’s screen for the long haul, try to mix it up with other games in between those marathon sessions so that the Switch’s pixels see some variety. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kCjD4j"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don’t turn off the sleep timer.&lt;/strong&gt; By default, the Nintendo Switch is set to go to sleep after five minutes of inactivity. You can also pick options between 60 seconds and 30 minutes. I think 10 minutes is as far as I’d leave it, personally, but definitely don’t pick “never” if you want to protect the display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Nintendo won’t make Europeans play worse versions of N64 games on Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfQ838-YOAFudQ6gL5ipxTRIjh0=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69979985/image.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The release also includes Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers for Switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="82bUHf"&gt;The Nintendo 64 games being re-released as part of the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription&lt;/a&gt; will run at 60Hz, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1447552226830991361"&gt;Nintendo of Europe&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed. The news follows concerns &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-24-nintendo-fans-fear-european-switch-online-n64-games-will-be-50hz"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the re-released games, which include classic titles like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;, would run at a reduced 50Hz in European PAL regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da8NEK"&gt;The disparity is a holdover from the days of standard definition TVs which typically used the 50Hz PAL standard in Europe, but the 60Hz NTSC standard in the US. It meant that footage shown on European TVs would refresh 50 times per second, rather than 60 as in the US. This wasn’t a major issue for regular TV content (which typically ran at 30fps in the US and 25fps in PAL regions), but it had a big impact on games where it could reduce the smoothness and responsiveness of gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3GqFGB"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All Nintendo 64 games included with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitchOnline&lt;/a&gt; + Expansion Pack can be played in 60Hz English language versions. Select games will also have the option to play the original European PAL version with language options. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nZeO4WQaPN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nZeO4WQaPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of Europe (@NintendoEurope) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1447552226830991361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T80ZWZ"&gt;Concerns that the re-releases would run at 50Hz in PAL regions arose pretty quickly after their Nintendo Direct announcement. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-24-nintendo-fans-fear-european-switch-online-n64-games-will-be-50hz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the broadcast showed the games running noticeably slower in the Nintendo UK version, and Nintendo declined to comment when asked about the disparity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9snHBa"&gt;The problem has cropped up with previous re-releases. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/uh-oh_nintendo_switch_onlines_n64_games_might_be_50hz_in_europe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Life&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the Wii’s Virtual Console included some 50Hz PAL games, although the company would rectify this with the Virtual Console service on the Wii U.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7WXMW"&gt;As well as offering a 60Hz option, Nintendo says select games will also include the option of playing in their original PAL versions “with language options.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hHTLe"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is set to include nine Nintendo 64 titles when it launches in late October, as well as a selection of Sega Genesis games. More N64 games, including &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;F-Zero X&lt;/em&gt; are due to arrive at a later date. The price of the subscription service is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
