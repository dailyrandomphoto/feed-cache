    <title>FDA authorizes first e-cigarette but only allows tobacco flavors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJvNHkqsVLWlXJRp1XVw3gjYSm8=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986176/vaping.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kztesM"&gt;After rejecting over one million e-cigarette related products, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-e-cigarette-products-marking-first-authorization-its-kind-agency?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it authorized its first e-cigarette: the Vuse Solo, made by R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company. The agency is allowing the company’s tobacco-flavored e-liquid pods on the market but rejected its flavored pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxavAo"&gt;It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665333/fda-vaping-flavors-authorization-juul"&gt;over a month&lt;/a&gt; since the FDA’s deadline for its review of vapes and e-cigarettes. Early September marked the end of a yearlong period where companies were allowed to keep selling their products, even though agency regulations said that any new tobacco products need authorization before they can be marketed. Now, anything sold&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;without authorization is being marketed illegally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KccU8z"&gt;Companies submitted applications for 6.5 million vaping and e-cigarette products, and the agency has rejected or said the applications were incomplete for the vast majority. The FDA says its decisions center on whether the benefits of an e-cigarette product to adult smokers — who may use it to quit smoking — outweigh the risk of hooking kids and teenagers on nicotine for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3hPO2"&gt;The tobacco-flavored Vuse e-cigarettes are the first that the FDA says meet that bar. Around 10 percent of high school students who vape use Vuse products, according to the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey. But teens are less likely to use tobacco flavors, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-e-cigarette-products-marking-first-authorization-its-kind-agency?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA rejected 10 of Vuse’s flavored e-liquid pods and is still reviewing its application for a menthol flavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRI9Pl"&gt;The agency said in its statement that it’s also restricting R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company’s advertising around its e-cigarettes to make it less likely teens will see the ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVtyPX"&gt;The FDA still hasn’t ruled on 2 percent of the submitted vaping and e-cigarette applications. That includes applications from Juul, a market leader and the company that’s been most heavily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928616/juul-ecig-vaping-fda-raid-inspection-smoking-nicotine"&gt;criticized and blamed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17850376/juul-ecigs-vaping-fda-smoking-nicotine-health-science"&gt;attracting kids&lt;/a&gt; and teenagers to vaping. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly can’t get enough chips for the iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UIk7a3dRnllE-5WPncwjzWcYPYc=/0x0:2028x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986132/vpavic_210916_4760_0082.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfElgh"&gt;The chip shortage is hitting the iPhone 13, with Apple reportedly unable to get enough parts to hit its planned manufacturing goals, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-aapl-to-cut-iphone-production-targets-due-to-chip-shortage?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple had originally planned to produce 90 million iPhones in the final months of 2021, but it’s reportedly slashing that number by 10 million (or around 11 percent) due to supply issues with chips from Broadcom and Texas Instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy8ePE"&gt;While the primary A15 Bionic SoC on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro is manufactured by TSMC, there are plenty of other chip-based components inside the phone that come from other sources. As iFixit’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B13%2BPro%2BFull%2BChip%2BID%2F144993&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F12%2F22723209%2Fapple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thorough teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro’s logic board&lt;/a&gt; shows, Texas Instruments and Broadcom are responsible for several key components, including chips that handle display power management, Face ID’s laser array, USB connectivity, wireless power, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yaz8Ky"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The shadow of the chip shortage is looming over tech’s big quarter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6KZnLs"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;already warned&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tesla-to-take-hit-from-chip-shortage-a-sign-of-problems-intensity-11627474416"&gt;company’s Q3 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that it might see chip supply issues, noting that “we’ll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we’re dealt.” But it seems that even with Apple’s best efforts and favorable relationships with suppliers, it just can’t get the physical components together that it needs to make enough iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19nqBT"&gt;It’s likely that Apple will eventually manage to get production up, but the slashed manufacturing estimate means that it’ll probably be even more difficult to find an (already tough to get ahold of) iPhone 13 in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="YmjrpX"&gt;On Tuesdays for the remainder of the year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be featuring additional new episodes, with each focused on a specific topic usually discussed on our regular Friday shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWSbB6"&gt;Today, we start our run with a discussion on the reviews we haven’t talked too much about yet on the show: this year’s software and hardware endeavors from Microsoft. In this episode, Dieter hosts a roundtable on reviews for the Microsoft products launched this fall:  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22713963/microsoft-surface-go-3-review"&gt;Surface Go 3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJHY7C"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5923826643&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1zTsPD"&gt;Dieter is joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewers Tom Warren, Monica Chin, and Dan Seifert, who have all reviewed the products, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONmJfV"&gt;The show answers questions like: Why does Windows 11 feel unfinished? How do the new Surface products fit in with a new operating system? How flexible of a machine (in both power capability and mode switching) are the new Surfaces for the thin and light class of devices? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuYAoA"&gt;You can listen to the full discussion here or on your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has banned nearly 1,000 ‘militarized social movements,’ documents reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-RACISM-PROTEST-UNREST" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1U45EKUm8pqhnERNMgY_0IwgD6I=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985642/1227795113.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JEFF DEAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="68Retr"&gt;Facebook has placed at least 986 groups on a private list of banned “militarized social movements,” according to internal Facebook documents &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/10/12/facebook-secret-blacklist-dangerous/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The documents hint at the scale of militia organizing on Facebook — something the company cracked down on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-hit-facebook-crack-down-n1237330"&gt;in August of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqKvKW"&gt;Militarized social movements are one part of Facebook’s larger “dangerous individuals and organizations” list, which &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21083395-dio-2"&gt;published a snapshot of&lt;/a&gt; in its entirety. The term refers to armed groups that promote armed conflict, as well as groups that support violence or looting at protests; in practice, it’s apparently composed largely of right-wing militias with some left-wing, anarchist, or generally anti-government organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7rnIdU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an adversarial space”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpENEg"&gt;Facebook’s “dangerous individuals” list also includes white supremacist bands, hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, and branches of Al Qaeda and other global terrorist organizations. All are banned from maintaining pages, groups, or profiles on the service. Beyond that, the categories are sorted into tiers. Tier 1 includes hate and terror groups, and Facebook users can’t express praise or support for them in any form. Tier 2 includes “violent non-state actors” like armed rebels that can only be praised for nonviolent activities. Militarized social movements are designated as Tier 3, which don’t have comparable restrictions on how users discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qad9Nk"&gt;Facebook noted in October of 2020 that it had identified 600 militarized social movements and removed around 2,400 pages and 14,200 groups maintained by them. The company also said it had removed 1,700 pages and 5,600 groups associated with QAnon — which is designated a militarized social movement but is not an organized group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBDZ0u"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; notes, the group designations can be fuzzy. One subset of the violent boogaloo movement, for instance, is classified as a Tier 1 terrorist organization, while the larger movement is a militarized social movement. The designation also includes news outlets like the anarchist site &lt;em&gt;It’s Going Down — &lt;/em&gt;which could theoretically have been grouped under the umbrella of “supporting violent acts amid protests” but is listed as an “armed militia group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVNb3g"&gt;Facebook has been criticized for both overly lax and overly punitive enforcement. But most recently, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;come under general scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; for not releasing details about its operations to outside researchers or policymakers, something that makes it more difficult to evaluate its moderation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIGnEj"&gt;In statements to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook said it had not previously released the list because publishing too many details might compromise the effectiveness of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1B69G"&gt;“This is an adversarial space, so we try to be as transparent as possible while also prioritizing security, limiting legal risks, and preventing opportunities for groups to get around our rules,” said counterterrorism and dangerous organizations policy director Brian Fishman.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password will now let you share passwords with just a link</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpHSsh9VlHePXfkCp9tDACDZT0Y=/644x265:2162x1277/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985638/Itemsharingdetails.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: 1Password&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="loRurv"&gt;Password manager 1Password is making it easier to share passwords with anyone, with Psst! (password secure sharing tool), &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/psst-item-sharing/"&gt;a new link sharing feature&lt;/a&gt; the company is releasing today. Instead of using 1Password’s pre-existing sharing options, which require an account, or just copying and pasting log-in information, which is inherently insecure, Psst! makes sharing a password a bit more like sharing a Google Doc with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPzf36"&gt;You can create a link to share password credentials, set when it expires (when the first person views it, or at one hour, one day, one week, 14 days, or 30 days), and share the password with specific people (via their emails) or for anyone with the link. The whole process is a lot like sharing a link to a Google Drive folder or a Google Doc. You can get an idea of how the whole thing works by watching the video 1Password created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="roK1ij"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgcDdxvyJPE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj5Cne"&gt;The experience for someone receiving a link can vary depending on the share settings. If you set what you’re sharing to be viewable by anyone, the link will just open up into a copy of the credentials at the time they were shared. If what you shared is only meant for a specific set of people, they have to confirm their email and then receive a one-time verification code to enter and receive access. It’s worth noting that the link only allows access to a copy of the information shared when you created the link. If you change the password stored in your vault later, old links won’t display the new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WErUjJ"&gt;The added security Psst! brings is partially dependent on the security of the email receiving those verification codes (one can imagine a scenario the receiver’s account has been compromised), but this method keeps the rest of your vault’s information secure, provides a way to track who accessed the login, and access to the login expires whenever you decide it should. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter testing an easier way to switch to your reverse-chronological feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZagSMEdC8_OrY6NwUQPr2ekqPA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985496/akrales_180620_1777_0266.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvoE7v"&gt;Twitter is testing a new way to switch to your reverse-chronological feed a bit more easily, the company announced Tuesday. Right now, when you tap the three-star icon at the top of your feed to switch between the Home feed (which sorts tweets for you) or the Latest feed (which shows them in reverse chronological order), a small menu shows up that prompts you to switch to whichever feed you’re not on. For some users on iOS, though, when you tap the three-star icon, Twitter is testing new Home or Latest tabs at the top of your screen instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rwzB4"&gt;Here’s what the change will look like, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1447971179185295364"&gt;according to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve pinned lists, the tabs should look familiar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VXByQf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Top Tweets first or latest Tweets first? We’re making it easier to switch between the two timelines and know which one you’re scrolling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now testing with some of you on iOS: swipe between "Home" and "Latest" on the Home tab to choose which Tweets you see first. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LoyAN4cONu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LoyAN4cONu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1447971179185295364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce07w2"&gt;This change does feel like it will be an improvement since it will mean fewer taps to switch between feeds and make it easier to know at a glance which feed you’re looking at. That said, it’s unclear if Twitter plans to roll this test out more broadly and, if so, when that might happen. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hEQsAZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628622/fortnite-among-us-copy-new-imposters-game-mode"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Imposter mode&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; clone in all but name, but nearly two months later, Epic Games is finally acknowledging in &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v18-20-update-combat-assault-rifle-vs-combat-smg"&gt;today’s patch notes&lt;/a&gt; what was clear from the start: Imposters was “inspired by &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; from Innersloth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlXtIz"&gt;Imposters launched in August, set in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s canon and 3D worlds but borrowing heavily from &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ gameplay, mechanics, and even terminology (like the “Imposters” name itself). At the time, Epic didn’t credit &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; or Innersloth, leading members of Innersloth’s team to complain about having their work copied without credit or the chance to collaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xthuap"&gt;As Innersloth co-founder Marcus Bromander noted at the time, the company didn’t patent the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; mechanics, but he lamented Epic’s lack of effort in developing its own more unique take on the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xyzuum"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We didn't patent the Among Us mechanics. I don't think that leads to a healthy game industry. Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?&lt;/p&gt;— Puff (@PuffballsUnited) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PuffballsUnited/status/1427781760692068355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>NASA’s massive next-generation space telescope arrives in South America ahead of launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RK110eq--2ZrvQdYw66BH6cCdQU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985214/51540583960_6b4cb9d516_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JWST undergoing testing at Northrop Grumman earlier this year&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Northrop Grumman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rt9Qwg"&gt;After more than two decades of delays and ballooning development costs, NASA’s next-generation space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-webb-space-telescope-arrives-in-french-guiana-after-sea-voyage"&gt;has arrived in French Guiana, South America&lt;/a&gt; — the site of the spacecraft’s planned launch later this year. Its arrival sparks the beginning of weeks of final preparations before the telescope is loaded on the top of its rocket for flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5ZYBF"&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, spent 16 days at sea, packed inside an environmentally controlled, custom-built shipping container aboard a French cargo ship. The vessel transported the spacecraft from Redondo Beach, California, the site of the telescope’s primary contractor, Northrup Grumman. JWST had been at Northrop since early 2018, where it was undergoing final assembly and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z12iHq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the spacecraft is closer than ever to its launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2iuhN"&gt;Now that JWST is in French Guiana, the spacecraft is closer than ever to its launch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17627560/james-webb-space-telescope-cost-estimate-nasa-northrop-grumman"&gt;which has long been a moving target&lt;/a&gt;. Originally proposed in 1996, JWST was supposed to launch as early as 2007 for a cost of $1 billion. But the project’s timeline has been delayed numerous times, as the budget of the mission has increased to $9.7 billion. On September 8th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;NASA set a target launch date for December 18th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, 14 years later than originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n61UV1Gx89Z0tguvoXXfwoiDCxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22921186/calibriarrivalinfggunn_secondary.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA/Chris Gunn&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JWST arriving in French Guiana aboard the MN Colibri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qwLH9V"&gt;Many of the delays resulted from problems that arose during testing of the spacecraft. JWST has undergone a battery of tests, including vibrational and cryogenic testing, to ensure that spacecraft can withstand the intensity of launch and the harsh space environment. However, during testing and assembly at Northrop Grumman, some screws came loose, valves leaked, and engineers found tears in the spacecraft’s thin sunshield, which is crucial for protecting JWST from overheating while in direct view of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oCeFR"&gt;Testing eventually wrapped up on JWST in August of this year, and Northrop Grumman spent the next month carefully folding the telescope into the right configuration it needed to be in for transport to French Guiana. NASA also purposefully did not reveal the exact date JWST left Redondo Beach at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/03/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-pirates/618268/"&gt;over fears that the vessel carrying the spacecraft might be intercepted by pirates&lt;/a&gt;. Late in the night on September 24th, a police escort accompanied&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;JWST in its shipping container on a 26-mile journey through Los Angeles to Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, where it was loaded onto its ride to Kourou, French Guiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ30F6"&gt;There’s still plenty left to do before flight, but when JWST &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; launch, it’s set to revolutionize astronomy, allowing researchers to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before. Set to fly to space on top of a European Ariane 5 rocket, the telescope is supposed to journey to a spot one million miles from Earth. With a massive gold-plated mirror spanning 25 feet wide, JWST will be able to gather light from the oldest objects in the Universe — some that formed just after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wXupP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best gaming laptop in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best gaming laptop is the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is a great gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is a great gaming laptop you can buy for $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MaGh3q"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. You can buy it for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="n9BvYP"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OCz9wT"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OanWnj"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful 14-inch device that can keep up with the best 15-inch gaming laptops on the market, the only place you’ll find that is the Razer Blade 14. This slim and portable device includes Nvdia’s RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, Nvidia’s top-of-the-line mobile GPUs, as well as a powerful eight-core AMD chip. It’s a gorgeous device, with a QHD 165Hz display option and a classy RGB keyboard. There’s even a reasonable port selection, including HDMI 2.1 as well as two USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a portable, powerful gaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;A gaming laptop with an exceptional keyboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is no longer the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s still great. For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent, and the keyboard is one of the absolute best you can buy on the market. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, though the Razer Blade 14 delivers better raw performance, we still have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eM7Jm"&gt;Asus recently collaborated with DJ Alan Walker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with a box that becomes  DJ deck. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Daily’s founding producer, Theo Balcomb, is leaving the Times</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7C55vi0bdGERN2ggihKYqBDlIjA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69985142/VRG_TheoBalcomb_Expanded_Photo_s.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G1lEfK"&gt;Hello again, and thanks for reading &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;. Today’s an unexpectedly busy one — with a scoop for us to get into. I’ll waste no time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIg9kf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOOP: Theo Balcomb is leaving &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96DmyK"&gt;Theo Balcomb, the producer and co-creator of &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;who’s widely acknowledged for propelling the show to success, is leaving &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; nearly five years &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/a-big-hire-and-familiar-voice-for-new-audio-project/"&gt;after joining&lt;/a&gt;. Balcomb will launch her own independent business focused on producing and editing, she confirmed with &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;. Her last day will be October 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Jxcnd"&gt;A quick summary of Balcomb’s very busy audio life: She started at NPR as an intern and rose the ranks to become the youngest supervising producer on &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt;. She &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/a-big-hire-and-familiar-voice-for-new-audio-project/"&gt;joined the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 as senior producer for a soon-to-be-launched, unnamed show, aka&lt;em&gt; The Daily&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt; went on to be a smashing success that reaches &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/michael-barbaro-the-daily-podcast-new-york-times.html"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; of people per day. In 2019, she &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/theo-balcomb-to-lead-news-for-audio/"&gt;was promoted&lt;/a&gt; to executive producer of &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt; and News, where she is today. All of which is to say: Congrats to Theo, and we’re excited to hear what she gets up to next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sBKA5"&gt;Which leads to our next breaking news item...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcBZs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The newest podcast app on the block: New York Times Audio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQNedE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/the-new-york-times-launches-a-test-app-for-its-growing-audio-ambitions?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reports this morning&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is testing an audio-only app called New York Times Audio. The app will distribute the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ own podcasts, as well as licensed &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; episodes and audio versions of news and magazine articles created through Audm, which the company acquired in 2020. These Audm stories will come not only from the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; but also from other publishers, including &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. (The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ audio content will still be broadly available — this isn’t an exclusives move yet.) &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says the app is still being viewed as an “experiment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmm0th"&gt;Although the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ audio products are widely upheld as not only stellar pieces of work but also major hits, I’m not convinced this app will take off. We’ve seen the struggle new audio apps, like Luminary, have had when launching, even when they sign big names and recruit massive shows. It’s still not even clear whether Spotify has usurped Apple as the go-to podcasting app in the US, despite its mega-deals. Podcasting’s a crowded field, so I can only envision this &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; effort succeeding if the team makes the exclusives play or offers some sort of bonus material through the app. We’ll see, though, and if you get a chance to sign up for this beta, please do pass along screenshots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzPgf6"&gt;And finally: big &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; audio week, but…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRAWML"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caliphate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; subject admits to fabricating story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khd1IZ"&gt;The primary subject of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Shehroze Chaudhry, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/09/world/middleeast/shehroze-chaudhry-caliphate.html"&gt;has admitted&lt;/a&gt; to making up his story about life as a terrorist and executioner in Syria. Criminal charges against him have since been dropped. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote this news up, pointing out that a statement of facts in court claims Rukmini Callimachi, who hosted the show, pushed Chaudhry to share details on these killings. Callimachi denies this, however. You all know the story of &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; by now, but to sum it up: the show was widely praised, won a Peabody, and was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, but last year, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; announced that it would review the show after it “fell short of standards.” In this latest write-up, a &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson says, “Since that time, we’ve introduced new practices to prevent similar lapses,” but it’s unclear what those fixes are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8zulx"&gt;Alright, that’s enough &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;news for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XDeOqg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6PTkBc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interaction’s the word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teWMxt"&gt;I published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722468/spotify-amazon-facebook-audio-podcast-polls-interact"&gt;a report today&lt;/a&gt; about the interactive audio trend I’m seeing bubble up. Notably, Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701219/spotify-interactive-podcast-polls-question-answer-feature-launch-anchor"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a Q&amp;amp;A and polls feature for its Anchor podcasters, along with testing interactive ads, and Amazon has been spotted polling podcasters about their interest in polls, as well. There’s a lot more in the piece, which I encourage you all to read, but the big question for us is whether people want to tap a phone screen while listening to a podcast. Personally, I listen to my shows as an escape from the screen, so having to take it out of my bag to give a podcaster feedback doesn’t immediately appeal to me. Although, when I think about my favorite shows asking for my opinion, I can sort of see myself wanting to share. More than that, though, these features are just another way to lock both listeners and podcasters into a specific platform. Competition, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaR0xX"&gt;Facebook is one of the platforms attempting interaction in the form of comments, and it happens to have news for us this week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7aL156"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook gives an audio update, starts to expand podcast functionality globally; plus, a hint at its monetization goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7HXwz"&gt;Yesterday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720635/facebook-expands-live-audio-feature-more-creators-globally-instagram-reels-soundbites"&gt;gave us&lt;/a&gt; a clearer timeline and updates on all its various audio features. Plus, we got firm confirmation the company plans to get into podcast monetization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAdGR3"&gt;But first! The updates. Live Audio Rooms, Facebook’s Clubhouse competitor, are rolling out globally, including to Groups. Soundbites, its shareable audio clips feature, is also now coming to more people in the US over the coming weeks. And finally, in its section about podcasts, Facebook says it’s still siloing podcast functionality to the US, but critically, it notes: “We have a lot more to do here, and are excited to work alongside podcast creators to carry out our long-term vision in offering a holistic experience that brings together new distribution opportunities, discovery, monetization and social connection for podcasts in one place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94qU8e"&gt;The word that sticks out to me here is monetization. I suspected Facebook would be interested in not only distributing RSS-based podcasts on its platform but also potentially hosting and monetizing them. Facebook obviously doesn’t say that’s the plan explicitly in the above quote, but I have to imagine adding audio ads to its targeted ad marketplace is on the roadmap somewhere — it just makes sense! Also interesting here is Spotify has been attempting to recruit small businesses to its audio ad inventory (see its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697557/clubhouse-creators-hot-pod-newsletter-free-edition"&gt;latest ad campaign&lt;/a&gt;), and Facebook has the clear leg up. Its ad business is fully built out across various apps and mediums, it has lots more data than Spotify (however you feel about that), a massive user base, and it could easily slot audio into its self-serve platform. How fast can Spotify move?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KW0aiK"&gt;Although Facebook says it plans to roll out podcast functionality globally, it didn’t provide a rollout date. However, it might already be happening abroad, specifically in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTBmn4"&gt;Per a tweet, Argentina-based podcasters are being asked to integrate their RSS feeds with Facebook. Maybe the global Facebook podcast push will be happening soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHuV-xkYVpNbOw7jNv3_SAhvnuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22920937/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_9.25.13_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SizMPZ"&gt;Meanwhile, in independent land, we have a couple updates from popular shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmHFWE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re Wrong About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; co-host leaves the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHtOL7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re Wrong About&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast that reexamines media narratives around controversial figures and events, is losing a co-host. Michael Hobbes announced in yesterday’s 20-minute episode that he’s ready for a change. Sarah Marshall will continue the show, which has been a major success on Patreon with over 30,000 subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRRqGR"&gt;We’re all hearing about the big job changes — people quitting and trying new things mid-pandemic — and I imagine this is partially about that and partially about burnout. The independent creator world, even for successful folks, is an exhausting one. Michael still hosts his &lt;em&gt;Maintenance Phase&lt;/em&gt; show about the problems with diet culture, so presumably, we’ll continue to hear his thoughts over there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkLKHH"&gt;Alright, for our final one here, let’s get a look at another update on exclusives…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMpjMj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Podcast on the Left&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; abandons Spotify, signs a three-year deal with Stitcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M0Pga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Podcast on the Left&lt;/em&gt;, a successful independent show with over 15,000 Patreon subscribers, is goinag wide. The show went exclusive to Spotify in 2019, and today, SiriusXM and Stitcher announced the show will once again be RSS-based and available on all podcasting apps. This starts next year. Sirius/Stitcher will exclusively sell ads for the show, while Stitcher Premium subscribers can receive it ad-free. This marks the second major Spotify-exclusive show, after Joe Budden’s, to not re-up their contract with Spotify. I imagine we’re going to keep hearing more of this as the big-name contracts expire — a bad sign for Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDNNg2"&gt;Alright, that’s it. Wow. A marathon. Thanks, as always, for reading, and if you want more audio and podcasting news, subscribe for Hot Pod Insider. I’ll be back here Thursday with more.&lt;/p&gt;
