    <title>GM teases upcoming GMC Sierra Denali electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TA4xyQL7aOfh-M3zMOF6C_3S3p0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277439/GMC_Electric_Sierra_Denali.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WKnUzu"&gt;The GMC Sierra Denali full-size pickup truck is going electric. The automaker teased the first image of the upcoming EV much in the same way it did with the Hummer EV truck — by only showing off its front end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWNXma"&gt;The square-shaped nose of the truck is set off by L-shaped headlights and an illuminated logo in the middle. The massive grille on the gas equivalent has been smoothed out — a clear indication there is no internal combustion engine under this hood in need of cooling. And it appears we’ll be getting some sort of lighting system that indicates when the vehicle is charging, much like the Hummer EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dkaZq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The electric Sierra will only be available in GMC’s popular Denali trim&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yM1fyw"&gt;Other than that, details are slim. The electric Sierra will only be available in GMC’s popular Denali trim, it will run on GM’s Ultium electric vehicle battery platform, and it will be assembled at GM’s Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan. The truck will be unveiled next year but won’t go into production likely until early 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826236/chevy-silverado-ev-truck-production-sale-date"&gt;much like the Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="guqn7W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-CAUX8ESpM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTEBeA"&gt;The Silverado will make its public debut on January 5th at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. When it comes out, it will be one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s much larger $35 billion push into electric vehicles, as well as the first electric truck for the automaker’s Chevy brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNvbJg"&gt;But when they inevitably hit dealerships, both the Silverado and Sierra Denali will find the market fairly crowded. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;Rivian R1T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt; are expected to reach customers in greater numbers in 2022. GM’s electric truck production will lag behind the F-150 Lightning, which is expected to start in spring 2022. (Ford recently shut down reservations for the F-150 Lightning after receiving nearly 200,000 orders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I95ufW"&gt;The Sierra is one of GMC’s most popular trucks, with sales increasing 40 percent year over year in the second quarter of 2021. It’s also one of the automaker’s largest and most dangerously designed trucks, with a high hood and square-shaped front end that increases the size of the vehicle’s front blindspot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;Trucks with larger bodies and higher carriages&lt;/a&gt; mean pedestrians are more likely to suffer deadly blows to the head and torso. And higher clearances mean victims are more likely to get trapped underneath a speeding truck instead of pushed onto the hood or off to the side. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Glass Sound Speaker review: it’s not what it looks like</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A mood-setting novelty speaker that doesn’t slouch on sound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PjkZYO"&gt;Every so often, you get a reminder that Weird Sony is still alive and well. The company might be releasing best-in-class wireless earbuds, gorgeous OLED TVs, and premium soundbars, but it also still dabbles in unusual gadgets that stand no chance of appealing to a mass audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8iiuS"&gt;It’s fair to say that the $350 LSPX-S3 Glass Sound Speaker is exactly that kind of product. A combined portable Bluetooth speaker and candlestick-like table lamp, the LSPX-S3 is by no means designed for the everyday consumer. It’s not supposed to be your rugged, take-anywhere speaker. It’s a statement piece that could add ambiance to a romantic dinner, a bedside table, or a meal outside on a summer evening. Sony sees enough in this concept to have kept at it for three generations now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeRzh5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10925485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epYQUI"&gt;The LSPX-S3 stands slightly over 11 inches tall and is heavier than it looks at 2.5 pounds, with most of that weight residing in the very sturdy-feeling silver metal base. The heft is reassuring in that there’s little risk of the device tipping over accidentally. You could say the Glass Sound Speaker gives off futuristic oil lamp vibes, maybe, but most people I’ve shown it to have immediately concluded that it most closely resembles a bong. It’s certainly a conversation starter, but any potential appeal will come down to your own taste. To me, this looks like a speaker that belongs in a lake cabin or an art studio. It might feel a little out of place in some contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ES_3WS1VP8SAWYkwXSU0VzX4i8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085918/cwelch_211213_4926_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LSPX-S3 produces warm ambient light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEOwSA"&gt;Around back, near the bottom of the base, you’ll find a USB-C port for charging the battery and buttons for power, answering a phone call, and controlling the volume. Sony includes a short USB-C to USB-A cable in the box but no power adapter. Under the speaker are additional buttons for Bluetooth pairing and setting a sleep timer. On Android, the LSPX-S3 supports Fast Pair for easy setup. Perhaps most surprising is that Sony also includes its higher-quality LDAC codec among the speaker’s features, allowing you to play music at higher bitrates from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and others that offer lossless audio. LDAC might seem like overkill for a speaker of this relatively small size, but I’m glad to see Sony extending it to more products — especially considering the price premium of this one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-KYbEccC9BmHmvW-xv6LzphOMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085921/cwelch_211213_4926_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The buttons are located at the back of the speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHiJsk"&gt;The glass tube isn’t there purely for aesthetics. According to Sony, three actuators in the speaker are attached to the end of the glass and vibrate the entire glass tweeter when audio is playing “to spread sound in every direction.” And if you’re holding the LSPX-S3 in your hands, it really can sometimes seem like the sound is originating from the tube rather than the base beneath it. But I can’t overlook that there’s an inherent fragility to this design that isn’t present with other portable speakers made from more durable materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eODDn1"&gt;You can adjust the brightness of the LED but not the color temperature; it’s meant to always mimic the warmth of candlelight. The first mode lets you choose a fixed, consistent brightness by sliding your finger along a touch sensor on the back of the speaker. (There are 32 levels of brightness in all.) Switching over to candlelight mode makes the LED gently dim and illuminate like the flickering of a candle. You can also have the light pulse in sync with whatever music is being played, though this effect is more subtle than you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6lgHFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It might be portable, but this isn’t a speaker you want to drop&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dD1k6W"&gt;The LSPX-S3 plays the role of a candle well enough that its flickering would have you think it was the real thing if it was off to the side of a table during dinner. I found it pleasing, but you’d hope it could pull off that trick for the price Sony’s asking. Even at its highest brightness setting, you should only expect ambient lighting from the Glass Sound Speaker; it’s not some high-intensity household lamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UebqF1"&gt;So it does the job as a candle replacement, but how does it rank as a speaker? Better than I expected before I turned it on, honestly. Sound is distributed evenly in all directions, and the LSPX-S3 has enough power to fill small rooms with tunes. Where this speaker really shines is in its upper register. Acoustic guitars, other string instruments, and brass all come through with a fantastic, crisp clarity — and the same holds true for vocals. That’s where the glass tweeter really makes a difference. There’s no muddiness whatsoever to the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JDjN5HOt5FBVbVaWUULb8qRhhBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087698/thelamp.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LED can flicker to convincingly mimic candlelight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vazuft"&gt;That said, the speaker is limited by its size and the space constraints that Sony faced when filling it with driver components. The soundstage isn’t all that wide, and this means that some genres (acoustic, classical, jazz, etc.) are better suited to get the most out of this speaker than others like rock, pop, electronic, or hip hop. Having just seen them in Brooklyn a few weeks ago, I’ve been on a Hold Steady kick, and the LSPX-S3 doesn’t have quite enough presence to make their records shine. The keyboard and other instrumentation can get drowned out in the cramped mix output. Bass isn’t going to rattle surfaces, but Sony does include a bass boost toggle in its mobile app if you want to crank that part of the EQ as much as possible. Sony’s glass speaker has more clarity to it than many Bluetooth speakers, but bigger units can definitely outperform it on the boom factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npOyeu"&gt;You’ll get up to eight hours of battery life from the speaker on a charge, which seems perfectly sufficient for its indoor or backyard use cases. This isn’t the kind of product you’ll be taking on the road, so it doesn’t exactly need to match the 15-hour battery of a UE Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IipKpqfrUS1mWmm-sgWyBfUNiHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085919/cwelch_211213_4926_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glass tube helps the speaker’s treble performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5FAxU"&gt;For whatever good traits it has, the LSPX-S3 is unfortunately missing a lot. There are volume buttons but inexplicably no play / pause or track controls. (The buttons are also located on the back, which is nice for looks but more of a hassle for usability.) This speaker lacks any voice control “smarts.” It only does playback over Bluetooth and not Wi-Fi, leaving out features like Apple’s AirPlay 2, Google Cast, or Spotify Connect. You can group two glass speakers together as a stereo pair, but I can’t in good conscience recommend that anyone burn $700 on that proposition: you can do tons better for the money by sticking with more traditional speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="AIfyCN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10925510"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="e7LebM"&gt;But that brings us back to this being a Weird Sony product that isn’t aimed at someone shopping for a “normal” Bluetooth speaker. Sony itself sells plenty of those for less money, as do brands like Ultimate Ears, JBL, Bose, and countless others. The LSPX-S3 Glass Sound Speaker is one of a kind, and its candlelight-mimicking capabilities make it the best execution of this concept so far. That doesn’t mean I’d buy it, but if you’re itching to put this thing in your dining room or in a getaway cabin, there’s nothing wrong with getting lavish and weird sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Spruce up your digs with some clever gadgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nmh7YT"&gt;Home is what you make it, so why not make it as awesome as possible? Sometimes, that can be done by just hanging up a sentimental photo in a frame or spritzing things up occasionally with some flowers or a new piece of furniture. Every now and again, however, you just need to gift yourself some crafty home tech goodies or buy them for someone you care about. Not every item in the list below has a circuit board built into it — though many of them do; instead, what ties them all together is that, in small ways, they’ll make your home look better and operate more smoothly, and perhaps let you relax a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPlj3d"&gt;We’ve consulted the minds at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for their ideas, and what follows are a couple of dozen gift ideas for anyone who’s looking to liven up their abode with some clever home tech. From an affordable robot vacuum and smart lighting to a 4K TV that moonlights as a Monet when not in use, there’s something for everyone on our list. In fact, in an effort to appeal to even more people (and in time for the holidays), we’ve added a couple of more options, specifically the Abode Cam 2 and Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="uAdBvY"&gt;Nintendo closed out the show by revealing that acclaimed indie RPG &lt;em&gt;Omori&lt;/em&gt;, which originally debuted on the PC last year, will be hitting the Switch in the spring. Before that, we got looks at several interesting-looking story-driven games. That includes &lt;em&gt;Loco Motive&lt;/em&gt;, a classic point-and-click adventure that is, as the name implies, a murder mystery set on a train (out next summer); and &lt;em&gt;Afterlove EP&lt;/em&gt;, the next release from the creatives of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134502/coffee-talk-game-review-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coffee Talk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (out next summer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wfUvDX"&gt;If you’re looking for some co-op action, a few good options were revealed at the showcase. &lt;em&gt;Aliisha: The Oblivion of Twin Goddesses&lt;/em&gt; is a two-player adventure where two sisters must work together to solve puzzles; it’s due out next spring. On the other end of the spectrum is &lt;em&gt;River City Girls 2&lt;/em&gt;, a classic beat ‘em up that you can play solo, but which is almost certainly more fun with a friend. It features both local and online play and launches on the Switch next summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s Concept Stanza converts your chicken scratch to digital text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A worker holds the Dell Concept Stanza in their left hand in portrait mode at a white marble table in a cafe setting. On the screen are some drawings and notes. In their right hand is a black stylus." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW0lH-srKEIieThxb6c_FZ5tdx4=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277284/Concept_Stanza___lifestyle_image___over_shoulder___embargoed_until_Dec_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is.&lt;/em&gt; | Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ar234k"&gt;Dell has shown off a new concept device that (let’s be honest) may never actually come out — but it’s a lot of fun to play with. The Concept Stanza is an 11-inch tablet that’s meant to simplify the process of taking notes at work. The idea is that if you write on the Stanza and then double tap your notes, they’ll be instantly converted to digital text. Connect it to a computer, and your notes will show up on the big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSK333"&gt;Now, this is obviously not a revolutionary use case — devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Notes&lt;/a&gt; can convert handwritten notes to digital ones already. But the big difference with the Stanza is that it’s &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;for writing — there are no cameras, speakers, or ports on the device, in an effort to create what Dell describes as a “distraction-free experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy6yaj"&gt;Dell’s tablet can also recognize more than letters. You can draw a line through text to delete it and can theoretically digitize shapes (such as Venn diagrams) as well. Separately, the Stanza can serve as an external monitor to extend your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Concept Stanza mounted horizontally on a stand with the stylus magnetically attached to the top, on a desk with a cup of pens and a row of notebooks in the background. The screen displays BioFrame 2.0 software." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PymGJgdq4gVXkxZTmeWfXHeI2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098700/Concept_Stanza___docked___embargoed_until_Dec_15.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s the stylus, magnetically attached.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRfjb9"&gt;I got to try the Stanza out for a few brief minutes. It was a comfortable writing experience — the stylus is compact and the tablet’s screen is smooth. The device correctly interpreted all of my (fairly messy) writing. In English, that is — though we were told that the device is supposed to support a whole bunch of languages, I tried writing some things in Chinese and Korean characters that it did not recognize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EsY8B"&gt;So, work in progress. Since the Stanza is still in the concept stage, there’s no pricing and availability yet, and no guarantee that it’s going to become a real thing you can buy. But it could certainly be a nifty tool for boardroom and classroom use. It’s the rare concept device that I think seems pretty ready to go — though I hope it figures out how to do multiple languages at once. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People spent 15 hours roleplaying a McDonald’s drive-thru on Twitter Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="England Relaxes Strictest Aspects Of Coronavirus Lockdown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_PCiRCEyvWxwu_7zZxn6JysMao=/5x0:4180x2783/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277200/1243414240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Burstow/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HDmuh6"&gt;I didn’t think I’d spend the first two hours of my morning listening to people place orders at an imaginary McDonald’s drive-thru. And yet that’s exactly what I did thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXNISQ"&gt;Twitter user Julee, whose handle is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thequeensbit"&gt;@thequeensbit&lt;/a&gt;, spent hours roleplaying as a McDonald’s cashier to an audience of thousands of listeners. At the time I joined the conversation, she was on hour 13 with more than 1,700 people tuned in. She approved one user to speak at a time as the customer. The customer would then put in their order, often incorrectly, or make absurd requests for food that’s not on the menu. One person asked for “the cookies, and put it in milk in a bowl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mLbStb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;welcome to mcdonald’s may i take ur order ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/ujJThBCPOa"&gt;https://t.co/ujJThBCPOa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— julee (@thequeensbit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thequeensbit/status/1470914796925165573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hYfrzy"&gt;Julee almost always goes along with the bit even though that’s led her into some strange storylines of handing out bags of fries, selling marijuana with orders, or sorting out drama between customers and other “employees.” One customer asked for a “Sprite, extra spicy,” and “a bag just filled with BTS sauce.” Julee happily obliged. Another asked her to put a Big Mac through a paper shredder to make the meat more akin to Arby’s roast beef. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xSFbT"&gt;After nearly two hours of listening, I’ve heard customers threaten robbery, order cuisines not normally served at McDonald’s, cry over spouses who have left them, and complain about the several-hour line that exists outside of this nonexistent McDonald’s. For the most part, people seem committed to the bit. Julee is the one to break character the most, lamenting her missed therapy appointment or spending a moment celebrating the length of time the Space has continued going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7j3s1V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Next level performance Art   &lt;a href="https://t.co/nD6yhpfC4i"&gt;https://t.co/nD6yhpfC4i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jason@calacanis.com (@Jason) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1471044669639311362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5LiWtd"&gt;What made this Space so captivating is, frankly, its weirdness. Many of Twitter’s live audio rooms are hosted by journalists or business leaders who want to speak with others in their industry about niche or newsworthy topics. Yet Julee has captivated an audience of over 1,000 listeners by playing pretend. While this is outside of the norm for Twitter Spaces, some strange rooms have popped up on Clubhouse, too, like people roleplaying a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;VIPs-only Mansion Party&lt;/a&gt; or, uh, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vd7y/inside-the-clubhouse-room-where-people-moan-like-whales"&gt;pretending to be whales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBcjVD"&gt;The Space promised to be a 24-hour drive-thru, but unfortunately it shut down this morning — apparently it crashed — sometime around the 15-hour mark. It was a welcome distraction while it lasted. This Space could be a one-off created by a hilarious user, or it could be a sign that Clubhouse’s roleplay culture may be bleeding over into Twitter. Even if that sign is shaped like McDonald’s iconic golden arches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple scrubs controversial CSAM detection feature from webpage but says plans haven’t changed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PE4bW86HfAYrTlwzmeUDjm5YN-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277130/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="08LtgO"&gt;Apple has updated a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;webpage on its child safety features&lt;/a&gt; to remove all references to the controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;first announced in August&lt;/a&gt;. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, appears to have taken place some time &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210163051/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;between December 10th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211213213636/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;December 13th&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the change to its website, the company says its plans for the feature haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkMs8A"&gt;Two of the three safety features, which released earlier this week with iOS 15.2, are still present on the page, which is titled “Expanded Protections for Children.” However references to the more controversial CSAM detection, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;launch was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from privacy advocates, have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7KASm"&gt;When reached for comment, Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said that the company’s position hasn’t changed since September, when it first announced it would be delaying the launch of the CSAM detection. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,” the company’s September statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWxRtC"&gt;Crucially, Apple’s statement does not say the feature has been canceled entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;outlining&lt;/a&gt; how the functionality works are still live on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x2oxlg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7BX0L3"&gt;Apple’s CSAM detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;was controversial&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced because it involves taking hashes of iCloud Photos and comparing them to a database of hashes of known child sexual abuse imagery. Apple claims this approach allows it to report users to the authorities if they’re known to be uploading child abuse imagery without compromising the privacy of its customers more generally. It also says the encryption of user data is not affected and that the analysis be run on-device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9fFJg"&gt;But critics argue that Apple’s system risks undermining Apple’s end-to-end encryption. Some referred to the system as a “backdoor” that governments around the world might strong-arm Apple into expanding into including content beyond CSAM. For its part, Apple has said that it will “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;not accede to any government’s request to expand it&lt;/a&gt;” beyond CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcz1P8"&gt;While the CSAM detection feature has yet to receive a new launch date, Apple has gone on to release two of the other child-protection features it announced in August. One is designed to warn children when they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;receive images containing nudity in Messages&lt;/a&gt;, while the second provides additional information when searching for terms related to child exploitation through Siri, Spotlight, or Safari Search. Both rolled out with iOS 15.2, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;released earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and which appears to have prompted Apple to update its webpage. &lt;/p&gt;

Ahead of CES, the company showed off the webcam alongside its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22832895/dell-luna-sustainable-laptop-concept-repairability-recyclable-environment"&gt;ultra-repairable Luna laptop concept&lt;/a&gt;. The Concept Pari doesn’t just cut the wire — it adds magnets that would theoretically make it easier to place anywhere on your screen, which means instead of automatically giving people side-eye on Zoom calls, you could finally make some eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIRtwZ"&gt;At first glance, the Concept Pari looks like the typical webcam that sits atop your monitor. However, Dell made it so that you can remove the cylindrical camera housing from its dock (which also doubles as a USB-C wireless charging station, letting you carry around the 1oz camera in your hand). The camera itself shoots in 1080p, has a built-in mic, and because it’s wireless, is connected to Wi-Fi. Dell also notes that it comes with a vertical indicator light, helping you maintain alignment as you use the camera freehandedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c9kSIj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Concept Pari comes with a magnetic backing that allows you to stick the camera anywhere on your monitor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YW0CT8"&gt;What might be neater than its wire-free housing is that if you’re tired of staring into the face of a soulless webcam during virtual meetings, the Concept Pari comes with a magnetic backing that allows you to stick the camera anywhere on your monitor (hopefully without affecting the display). Place the camera just above the head of the person you’re talking with, and you should be able to comfortably maintain eye contact while actually looking at the person on your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sIBhC"&gt;When you’re done with a meeting, you can reverse the camera in its dock so that it’s facing away from you, offering additional privacy when the camera’s not in use. Dell says it will still charge when it’s in this position. Although the webcam isn’t for sale just yet, and very well may never be, it’s a concept that doesn’t seem too unrealistic to see a lot of people adopting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Amazon warehouse policies put workers at risk</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Six people died in an Amazon warehouse collapse — why were they there at all?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2ToQoz"&gt;The tragic collapse of an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois during last week’s historic tornado outbreak in the Midwest is raising questions about the safety of the e-commerce giant’s packing facilities and the policies and protocols Amazon has in place to protect workers during disasters. Despite hours of notice that severe weather was imminent, workers were not sent home before a tornado struck the warehouse and killed six people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qek76q"&gt;The tornado appeared relatively suddenly, but it shouldn’t have caught warehouse managers off-guard. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSStLouis/status/1469488781594034177?s=20"&gt;The official tornado warning&lt;/a&gt; from the National Weather Service came &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/lsx/12_10_2021"&gt;just 22 minutes&lt;/a&gt; before the tornado itself — but those rushed timelines are typical for tornadoes. More importantly, the National Weather Service warned of a moderate risk of tornadoes the day before the disaster, so anyone running a facility should have known to be on their guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yFRfN"&gt;But crucially, there was no legal obligation for how the Edwardsville warehouse needed to respond to the warnings. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires most businesses to have Emergency Action Plans, which include evacuation procedures, but US law leaves it up to employers to make the call on whether to send employees home ahead of a natural disaster. A spokesperson for OSHA wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they were “not aware of any policy or requirement of a business to shut down and send people home.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="klvy0h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s the private sector. They can do what they want to do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zyah1Q"&gt;Experts in the emergency management field believe it’s unlikely such a policy will ever be implemented at the national scale because of its unpopularity with businesses and how it might cut into profits. Plus, every business is different — and there might be some with more critical operations or with components that could become dangerous if left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFlIng"&gt;“​​They’re never going to make a law or a policy to do that, because it’s the private sector. They can do what they want to do,” says Laura Myers, senior research scientist and director of the University of Alabama’s Center for Advanced Public Safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMYgJF"&gt;In short, it was Amazon’s choice about whether the tornado risk was severe enough to shut down the factory — and the company chose to keep the warehouse running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbfYgo"&gt;“The event itself has opened the eyes of many to the fact that we’ve probably had this patchwork quilt for a long time, and maybe it’s time to put those pieces together,” says Kimberly Klockow-McClain, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Severe and High-Impact Weather Research and Operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrxYXk"&gt;Amazon did not answer questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about why it decided to keep its warehouses open despite the severe weather. OSHA is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833012/amazon-fatal-warehouse-collapse-osha-investigation-illinois-tornado"&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; what took place the night that the tornado tore through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaE6nS"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon PR manager Alisa Carroll said that “emergency response training is provided to new employees and that training is reinforced throughout the year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YK6xKq"&gt;She further added that the company updated its cellphone policy in 2020 due to COVID, “allowing our employees to have their phones with them. All reporting that it’s been rolled back to pre-COVID is simply not true and factually incorrect.” Phones are critical for receiving alerts about severe weather and can be especially vital to workers if their employers aren’t taking action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoUj0Y"&gt;Carroll added that “OSHA guidance clearly states to take shelter immediately when there’s a tornado warning. Our leaders on the ground followed their training and did just that, moving quickly to get people to take shelter immediately. That likely saved many lives from this storm.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recovery operations continue after the partial collapse of an Amazon facility in Edwardsville, Illinois on December 12th, 2021. The facility was damaged by a tornado on December 10th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg0HuU"&gt;Still, the tragedy fits a troubling pattern of Amazon warehouse workers staying at their posts through extreme and even dangerous conditions. In June, during a record heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, some &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/heat-wave-daily-news-updates-june-27-what-to-know-about-the-heat-dome-across-the-pacific-northwest/"&gt;workers at an Amazon warehouse in Washington state&lt;/a&gt; said many workstations lacked functioning fans, and temperatures inside the facility were close to 90 degrees. At Amazon’s JFK8 facility in Staten Island, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nv7g/amazon-workers-describe-excessive-heat-fainting-in-nyc-warehouse"&gt;workers reported in July&lt;/a&gt; that the warehouse was too hot, while they were pushed to keep “working at a non-stop pace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZduiXu"&gt;Workers at the Edwardsville warehouse &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/12/13/amazon-illinois-tornado-safety-protocols/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they received almost no emergency training and were discouraged from taking time off during natural disasters — something that appears to be common across the company’s warehouses. Courtenay Brown, a worker at an Amazon Fresh warehouse in Avenel, New Jersey, told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that workers there also received little training about what to do in an emergency. “They teach you how to do the job, show you what to do, then you go on your own, and that’s it,” Brown said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wbdinz"&gt;Brown recalled one incident when there was a chemical leak at the facility. “Only the front of the warehouse was evacuated, until the fire department found out ‘Oh wait, there are hundreds of people in the back of the warehouse?’” she said. The employees in the back didn’t know there was an emergency at first, Brown said, and when they realized what was happening no one was quite sure where to go. “We just started screaming at everyone to exit out the dock doors, we tried to get every single person out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmilF4"&gt;There are also structural factors that can place warehouses at greater risk. Warehouses are often built using “tilt-up construction,” says Matt May, director of the emergency management department for the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas. Concrete slabs are tilted to become walls and then held upright by their connections to the roof. It’s a practice that &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110627135242/http://www.kansascity.com/2011/06/25/2975177/experts-challenge-building-design.html#ixzz1QZoEgC5d"&gt;engineers criticized&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a 2011 tornado that decimated a Home Depot in Joplin, Missouri. That could be a bigger issue for worker safety in the US moving forward, since warehouses have replaced offices as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816131/warehouses-natural-gas-emissions-climate-change"&gt;most common commercial buildings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTgpRw"&gt;Historically, building codes haven’t addressed the severe winds associated with tornadoes, according to Anne Cope, chief engineer at the nonprofit research organization Insurance Institute for Business &amp;amp; Home Safety. But OSHA’s guidance on tornadoes says to avoid “auditoriums, cafeterias and gymnasiums that have flat, wide-span roofs” — structures similar in shape to warehouses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nmrW07"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What is its highest priority?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0zl7ob"&gt;“The biggest challenge for [Amazon] is their buildings themselves,” May says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pCsU3"&gt;The tragedy is already galvanizing labor groups, which see it as part of a broader problem with the company. Eric Frumin is the health and safety director for the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC), a coalition of four labor unions that has pushed for actions against Amazon, and says the Edwardsville deaths can be traced to Amazon’s practice of placing customers ahead of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2pjJyN"&gt;“What is its highest priority? They have not been shy about this: the company says it is obsessed with pleasing customers,” he said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And everything else, including worker safety, be damned.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiOChQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s west coast server outage is over, and Twitch is back up</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aG5j0H"&gt;Amazon Web Services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829544/amazon-web-services-overwhelmed-network-outage"&gt;barely finished the postmortem&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;last week’s incident that interrupted deliveries and shut off feeds from security cameras&lt;/a&gt; before AWS started having problems again. While last week’s outage was in the US-EAST-1 region, reports around 10:45AM showed connections to the company’s US-West servers were failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1iLTt5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  We are aware of several issues affecting Twitch services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our team is aware and hard at work fixing them - we'll continue to update you, here.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1471144138473189382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YoC5qt"&gt;The network of Amazon server farms powers more services than you can imagine, but the most visible sign of trouble showed up once Twitch, the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform, went down. A tweet from its support account said, “We are aware of several issues affecting Twitch services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5axcdt"&gt;There are also reports of disconnections for services like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, DoorDash, Duo, and Slack, while gamers experienced disconnections and server issues across Nintendo Online, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBjGTS"&gt;A message on the &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS Status page&lt;/a&gt; initially said, “We are investigating Internet connectivity issues” for both the US-WEST-1 and US-WEST-2 region. Now, Amazon reports that “[we] have resolved the issue affecting Internet connectivity” as of 11:10AM ET, and hopefully, it will stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JmIDg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 11:23AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note the outage has been resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
