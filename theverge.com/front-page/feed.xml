  &lt;p&gt;Netflix is getting into video games&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="5hhtFz"&gt;Netflix is making a big push into video games. The company first dabbled in games with interactive titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game, but in 2021, it made gaming a much bigger priority. Netflix hired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;a former EA exec&lt;/a&gt; in July to lead its gaming efforts and, in November, let people play a selection of mobile games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772480/netflix-games-apple-iphone-ipad-ios-subscription-app-store"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; as part of their subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rlEk"&gt;We’ll be watching Netflix’s gaming efforts closely, and you can read our coverage right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix Games is available on your iPhone and iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UznZZmBkMlGPBD0pf9QUtji0jA=/81x0:879x532/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117697/Screen_Shot_2021_11_02_at_1.24.40_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNi04P"&gt;Netflix just brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;its new gaming service to all subscribers on Android&lt;/a&gt;, but now it has officially come to iOS. The service gives users access to a limited selection of mobile games without ads or in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGhJRX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1458133903160479746?s=20"&gt;A tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mark Gurman confirms that the five launch games are already available as individual downloads from the App Store. These include &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/stranger-things-1984/id1574739824"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/stranger-things-3-the-game/id1574824199"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3 The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/shooting-hoops/id1585735348"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/teeter-up/id1585735663"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teeter (Up)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/card-blast/id1586360462"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Card Blast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The just-announced game &lt;a href="https://hextechmayhem.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  — which will cost $10 on Switch and PC — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772338/league-of-legends-spinoff-netflix-games-nintendo-switch-hextech-mayhem"&gt;will be free to Netflix subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u51TzA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Netflix Games is coming to iOS! Starting tomorrow, you can access Netflix Games through the Netflix app on any mobile device, anywhere in the world. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LoHYFi4xBX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LoHYFi4xBX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iJK7mE"&gt;There’s been some concern about Netflix Games’ rollout on iOS, particularly because of Apple’s App Store policies that have gotten in the way of other gaming platforms and services. The policy typically prevents third-party apps from acting as storefronts for apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6tSmY"&gt;Per the tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1458132284909883393"&gt;@NetflixGeeked&lt;/a&gt;, tomorrow we’ll find out how Netflix adjusts its main app and if it serves as an all-in-one gaming hub as it does on Android, where users can select games to download from the Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwMcw8"&gt;Other cloud gaming platforms, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/20912689/apple-cloud-gaming-streaming-xcloud-stadia-app-store-guidelines-rules"&gt;Microsoft xCloud, Nvidia Geforce Now, and Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook Gaming have struggled to find a footing on iOS due to Apple’s demanding App Store restrictions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;All&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; have attempted to sidestep Apple’s policies by launching as web apps, but this obviously doesn’t provide the best gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzjE2u"&gt;However, there might be a precedent for Netflix’s good fortune. In internal emails uncovered in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;Apple went over possible concessions&lt;/a&gt; related to third-party apps offering in-app purchases, and different incentives that might appeal to Netflix. It reportedly wanted Netflix to continue selling subscriptions within its app so it could earn a cut of the money. If Apple was willing to treat Netflix as a special case then, it could do the same now. Google allegedly engaged in the same kind of behavior with Netflix, as lawyers claimed that Google was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22645974/google-netflix-class-action-antitrust-play-store-commission"&gt;giving Netflix a break&lt;/a&gt; on the standard 30 percent commission it takes out purchases made through Google Play Billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehaM97"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/netflix-launches-games-on-iphone-ipad-with-apple-payment-system?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gurman notes that players who launch the Netflix Games apps individually without an account are prompted to sign up for Netflix using Apple’s in-app system. If someone does that, then Apple receives a 30 percent cut of their payments for the first year, then 15 percent of each payment after that. Netflix still doesn’t send new customers through Apple’s payment system in its main app, but this odd arrangement may have been enough to get Netflix Games on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even Tim Sweeney thinks the Dell XPS 17 needs better cooling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Dell Xps 17" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fJZcmzqXt8FqXksENkmj2CKGixU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118094/mchin_181005_4093_0011.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tf9aNc"&gt;Tim Sweeney has made many headlines this year as the main character of Epic’s turbulent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;courtroom war with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. But on Tuesday, the CEO appears to have revealed an equally noteworthy side of himself: He’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 17&lt;/a&gt; user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQqqJi"&gt;Sweeney’s affinity for the XPS 17 dates as far back as September of this year. The executive tweeted a link to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1439772094653509633"&gt;Dell’s XPS 17 purchase page&lt;/a&gt; on the 19th, remarking that the laptop had “great options, simple view, customer-friendly defaults, reasonable prices, easy checkout.” Further down the thread, Sweeney complained that the high prices of entry-level workstations often drive developers to purchase gaming PCs instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMxYAw"&gt;Almost two months later, a new tweet suggests that Sweeney has joined the ranks of XPS 17 users. While he doesn’t directly state that he’s purchased an XPS 17 for himself, his impressions indicate that he’s spent at least some hands-on time with the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwaNZS"&gt;“The Dell XPS 17 is a good laptop but not great,” Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1457937413033054209"&gt;now writes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “Amazing screen, good keyboard and pad, but super awkward Home/End key placement for coding.” But his primary concern is the cooling system. Per the CEO, the XPS 17 “[r]uns hot even when idle” and “constantly chirps out RF noise from CPU activity through the speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSmmE8"&gt;Hello, Tim. Welcome to the world of portable workstations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2szWqj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Dell XPS 17 is a good laptop but not great. Amazing screen, good keyboard and pad, but super awkward Home/End key placement for coding (earlier Dells supported FN+Left/Right). Runs hot even when idle, constantly chirps out RF noise from CPU activity through the speaker. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7bS46meTrk"&gt;https://t.co/7bS46meTrk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1457937413033054209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mbibQf"&gt;Dell XPS laptops are excellent and well worth their high sticker price — but they’re also notoriously incompetent at keeping their chips cool. The last time I reviewed an XPS 17, the chip spent a solid amount of time over 90 degrees Celsius. Its smaller sibling, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;, has been an even worse offender in the past — I could hear its fans a room over during my testing, the keyboard was toasty under any kind of load, and the bottom was often so hot that I couldn’t keep the device on my lap. I’ve even seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13 2-in-1 &lt;/a&gt;hit 100 a few times. And the noise to which Sweeney refers is likely coil whine, which has been a common complaint against XPS laptops for years now. (It doesn’t mean a laptop is bad, but it is annoying.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eUGj8R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now this is an awesome laptop configurator. Great options, simple view, customer-friendly defaults, reasonable prices, easy checkout. Now do workstations!&lt;a href="https://t.co/Z9gjOJjWpT"&gt;https://t.co/Z9gjOJjWpT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1439770926787215362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NClN5g"&gt;It seems here that Mr. Sweeney has run into one of the most common perils of premium laptop shopping: the price of thinness. The XPS 17 straddles the line between a business and a consumer PC — its reasonable price and customer-friendly purchase interface make it a viable buy for single-unit shoppers, but it also has the thin and light build, as well as the power, that corporate customers often demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl500c"&gt;But those benefits still come with tradeoffs, and that’s particularly true when it comes to cooling heavy-duty chips. Even the best manufacturers on the market (setting aside Apple’s most recent MacBook Pro models — they’re in a league of their own) haven’t really figured out how to keep a workstation as thin and light as the XPS 17 both quiet and cold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drc61Z"&gt;I’m sure there are battalions of engineers across OEMs working on this problem as we speak. Please know, engineers, that we are all rooting for you. In the meantime, my advice to Mr. Sweeney would be to utilize the “Quiet” cooling profile in Dell’s power manager. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us gives crewmates their own powers just in time for Thanksgiving murder sessions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqFoIvlgu-yn3lDNNgM5LZJLL1A=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70118030/AMONGUS_ROLESONLYPROMO_1024x576.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pgeECb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us — &lt;/em&gt;the incredibly easy-to-play, viral backstabbing game where you spend the majority of your time lying to your friends while doing cutesy inane tasks aboard a rickety deathtrap — is getting perhaps one of its biggest updates yet: one that will decidedly change the game and one that’s &lt;em&gt;more than a little&lt;/em&gt; inspired by a popular mod that got squashed under the momentum of the official franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D82WpR"&gt;As you’ll read in &lt;a href="https://www.innersloth.com/new-roles-cosmicubes-out-now-emergency-meeting-33/"&gt;the full blog post&lt;/a&gt;, version 2021.11.09 introduces crewmate roles for the very first time, giving your humble workers superpowers, like being able to tell who’s dead (Scientist), sneak through the same vents as the imposters (Engineer), or shield other crewmates from getting killed (Guardian Angel). There’s a new type of imposter, as well: the Shapeshifter, who can change their appearance to look like any other crewmate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbwcoE"&gt;If those sound familiar, it’s probably because they’re very similar to roles &lt;a href="https://github.com/polusgg/Town-Of-Us"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Town of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which used to be a popular mod for &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; until it was depreciated in recent months. As a huge fan of the mod, I’m both excited and a little disappointed by the news — &lt;em&gt;Town of Us&lt;/em&gt; had &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; of intriguing roles that constantly keep veteran players guessing, and here, we’re only getting a few. &lt;em&gt;Among Us’&lt;/em&gt; developers say they want to add more roles and an additional map, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boKI83"&gt;The update has more than roles: developer Innersloth is also adding achievements and paid cosmetics (the company says they’ll help pay for server costs for the free mobile version in particular; PC and Switch versions cost a mere $4.99). You can get free “Beans” currency just by playing the game to unlock some cosmetics, but others will cost “Stars,” which you’ll need to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPd6c0"&gt;You have to unlock the cosmetics by following branching paths, which could be fun but also means you can’t necessarily just pick the items you want. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HXzhw2h1n3PRjI37mIl6a4-SvVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22999488/pasted_image_0__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Innersloth&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us’ new cosmetic unlocks follow branching paths.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jbeyBm"&gt;To coincide with the new currencies, account linking is also here, so you can take your items and experience across PC, mobile, Switch, and more to come. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qP3jv9"&gt;Exception: Stars purchased on Nintendo Switch™ will only be usable on that system. In the future, Pods &amp;amp; Beans earned on Switch can be shared across most systems. It’s not currently available with this update, but we’re working on it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rqK5t2"&gt;As the company previously revealed, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; will also launch on Xbox and PlayStation consoles on December 14th, and it’s teasing additional announcements before then.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuftUQ"&gt;Walmart is hosting yet another restock event for the PlayStation 5. The latest one is happening today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT. The retailer has seemingly alternated between offering consoles exclusively to those paying for its Walmart Plus plan and others that are a free-for-all for regular customers, comparatively speaking. Today’s restock fits in the latter category, so you can head over to Walmart’s site to get either the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3F&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PlayStation 5 console that has a Blu-ray disc drive&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3F&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 Digital Edition that omits the disk drive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrbnyJ"&gt;As usual, we recommend logging in to an account you might already have or creating one. It can help to have your billing and shipping info already saved in your account, reducing the time it takes to check out and minimizing chances of errors. There’s a chance that Walmart will offer up new waves of stock every 10 minutes, as it has done before. It also might put you in a queue instead. While the queue is a better, more organized tact, we’ve seen mixed results with it so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0MSo"&gt;If you don’t manage to nab a console today, fear not — we will continue serving you with details when more restocks happen. Something that’s worth doing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772145/ps5-restock-sony-ps-direct-november-holiday-playstation-5-register-email"&gt;is registering for the chance to get an invite to buy a PS5 directly from Sony&lt;/a&gt; in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyFw0k"&gt;We are also happy to save you money on everyday purchases outside of restocks, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;the lead-up to Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ll give you the deal digests twice a week when you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="3UF7sX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NBcCd8"&gt;Accessories to go along with your console&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Apple backs off of breaking Face ID after DIY iPhone 13 screen replacements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V0rR1qwozg8-bZtX-ZEVQyrZl6s=/0x0:2002x1335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117678/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="beNaVw"&gt;Soon after the iPhone 13 launched, repair experts found that swapping out iPhone 13 screens would break Face ID unless you also moved over a tiny control chip from the original screen. It’s a complex process that makes one of the most common types of repairs prohibitively difficult for independent repair shops. (Apple-authorized repair shops, on the other hand, have access to a software tool that can make a phone accept a new screen.) For indie repair shops, things may get easier soon, however, as Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will release a software update that doesn't require you to transfer the microcontroller to keep Face ID working after a screen swap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRdBHh"&gt;The current transfer procedure looks to be quite challenging, requiring time, special equipment, and the ability to microsolder. For many independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a key line of revenue, the process is likely prohibitively difficult and could be damaging to their business. iFixit detailed the situation &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22772433%2Fapple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at length&lt;/a&gt; in an article last week, and you can watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;a video of the microcontroller transfer process here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mOwVT"&gt;Apple didn’t specify exactly when the software update will arrive. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest League of Legends spinoff is coming to Netflix Games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dz-Ll2TVmfLqZ65WpSWFMKxLmcQ=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117622/hextech_mayhem.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qNmMwA"&gt;Riot is bringing a new &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;experience to Netflix Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LH77oP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993328/riot-forge-publishing-label-league-of-legends-games"&gt;Riot Forge&lt;/a&gt;, a publishing subsidiary of Riot Games dedicated to smaller, self-contained games within the League of Legends universe in collaboration with Bit.Trip developer Choice Provisions, announced its latest game: &lt;a href="https://hextechmayhem.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bb5z9G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem &lt;/em&gt;is a rhythm game in which you bounce &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;characters Ziggs and Heimerdinger to the beat of the music, unleashing city-busting bombs along the way. In addition to being available on Switch and PC on November 16th, the game will also be available at a later date to Netflix subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiFO1t"&gt;Netflix recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;it’s integrating games into its mobile app&lt;/a&gt;. While the initial offering of games was lackluster, this latest announcement hints at the kind of titles we can expect from Netflix in the future while adding an enticing value proposition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"&gt;Netflix as a gaming service&lt;/a&gt;. While players on other platforms will have to pay $10 for the pleasure, &lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem&lt;/em&gt; will be free on mobile to Netflix subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRJTjS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hextech Mayhem&lt;/em&gt; coming to Netflix Games is the latest development in the Netflix / Riot partnership. This week, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; — a &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; animated series exclusively on Netflix — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review"&gt;debuted with positive reviews&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix also announced its games will now be available on iOS devices starting November 10th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Emily Ratajkowski confronts her power — and yours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/prtVZp0XBo8oOG-xfI4Vvgidt4E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117532/EMILY_NEW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Michelle Rohn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The model talks about her new book, copyright law, online harassment, and OnlyFans&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t8Bvbj"&gt;Emily Ratajkowski knows how to play the game. Walking out of a bathroom nude before she’d hit it big, she marvels at how a powerful fashion photographer has fallen right into her trap: dismissing her as dumb, wanting to see her naked, then being shocked and impressed at the sight of her body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03teNr"&gt;“When I came out of the bathroom topless, I stood up straight, not covering my breasts,” she writes in her memoir &lt;em&gt;My Body&lt;/em&gt;. “I believed that by taking off my clothes proudly, by not letting myself be embarrassed by my nakedness, I might somehow intimidate you, shifting the dynamic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1J4URe"&gt;She does not. While Ratajkowski lands the job, she’s still reliant on sleazy men to get a paycheck. Now, as she reflects on the ways she’s capitalized on her own sex appeal, she’s wrestling with the central question: “What is the power of my body? Is it even &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; power?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvU8gw"&gt;It’s a question hinted at in Jia Tolentino’s essay &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/decade-in-review/the-age-of-instagram-face"&gt;“The Age of Instagram Face,”&lt;/a&gt; where she compares women who get plastic surgery to McKinsey consultants assessing a corporation, identifying underperforming assets and optimizing them for profit. The metaphor points to how broken the system is, but it also speaks to the natural inclination we all have to use the gifts we were born with to our advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQnnEE"&gt;Perhaps this is why Ratajkowski is hesitant to dismiss other women for their choices. Like Tolentino, she’s looking at the whole system, seeing the still-limited ways women can try to gain power. “That’s what I feel about any woman deciding to modify her image and body,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. “It’s like, ‘Of course she wants to do that. That’s the world we live in, and it’s a commodifiable asset.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL8mPe"&gt;Now, as the owner of a thriving direct-to-consumer swimwear line Inamorata, Ratajkowski is able to control her image and the end-product — a kind of vertical integration for the modeling industry. Is this real power? She’s not sure. “It’s still capitalism and it’s still selling clothes,” she says. “So I have problems around the girl boss politics of like, ‘There you go. That’s feminism. We did it.’ It’s just more complicated than that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHe8O2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for clarity and length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QqqMRa"&gt;
&lt;p id="zoKoDu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book started with an article in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Mag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; about who owns your image. What inspired you to write that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFqFMi"&gt;So, actually, &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; chose that essay out of the book proposal. It wasn’t the first essay I wrote. The book had been written and they were cool enough to choose one of the longer pieces, which I wasn’t expecting. That one came from having many, many experiences in my lifetime about both capitalizing off of my image and also feeling like others were capitalizing off of it without my control. And I was interested in that idea of all these Emilys in the world that were floating around. And while it was my livelihood, it also seemed not to belong to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPUSdn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious if the experience of writing that, and processing the fact that your image is yours and not yours at the same time, has changed how you go about signing modeling contracts. Do you think you could be in a position again where a photographer was able to exploit a photoshoot and essentially create subsequent projects that you don’t really have control over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5ws6m"&gt;I would say, never say never. Because I’ve had that experience and other experiences that I didn’t write about, I’m forever worried about that. And I’ve done so many photoshoots in my life, starting at a very young age. My modeling agency was in control of tons and tons of girls and was supposed to be protecting us, but also they’re not planning on our long-term careers. They’re not thinking about that. So I don’t know how many photographers have a hard drive of images of me that I have no ownership over. That’s just the reality of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMRXhP"&gt;But definitely because of that experience and knowing what it can be like, I now am very crazy about language in contracts and am always trying to tie up every loose end and make sure I’m protected. But that being said, there are still loopholes. Nothing’s ever completely airtight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlFG48"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a case that’s going on right now with a paparazzo who is suing you for posting an Instagram image of yourself — and you’re fighting back in court. It seems like this is an instance where you are trying to regain some power by making an argument about fair use, but the system is kind of working against you. The judge recently ruled that you violated the paparazzo’s copyright. What’s on your mind with the latest development?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5Jiz5"&gt;I wasn’t sure that I was going to win. And just to be clear, settling out of court and paying this paparazzi whatever x amount of dollars would’ve been the more financially smart decision for me. So I knew what I was getting myself into by deciding to go down this road, that it was going to be a battle. In some ways, it was more of a long-term versus short-term decision because I just felt more and more paparazzi could continue to sue me. And I wanted to send a message that I was going to fight back and also push these ideas more into the public eye so that people aren’t just like, “Oh yeah, whatever, copyright law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8o8oCO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book, there’s a chapter called Blurred Lines where you write, “In my early twenties, it never occurred to me that the women who gained their power from beauty were indebted to the men whose desire granted them that power in the first place.” You echo it in a later chapter when you say, “What is the power of my body? Is it even my power?” It’s the underlying theme, in some ways, of the whole book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="impLmz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It got me thinking that this is a lot of how internet celebrity works for women. It seems like with women who get famous on the internet, there’s this way in which you’re famous because people want to be you or they want to be with you. But ultimately, it’s the companies cutting your sponsorship deals that have the real money and power. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4aj4A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious if you agree and if you’ve answered that question for yourself: is the power of your body your power?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8JEm5"&gt;No, I haven’t answered that question for myself. I wish I had an answer for it, honestly. I think that you hit the nail on the head. It’s like when I think about OnlyFans and everything that’s going on with OnlyFans. It’s such a perfect example of that. It’s like women were trying to have an answer to the internet’s huge revenge porn issue and say like, “No, we’re going to be in control. We’re going to be the ones capitalizing off of our images.” But then you have a server that ultimately is profiting off of them and has the power to shut down the way that they make money at any point because their investors have decided that they’ve had enough of the sexy stuff or whatever. So I think that there are ways for women to have success and to have control by using and commodifying their image and their body. But ultimately it’s within the confines of larger power structures that mean that their position is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQZouB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has having your own business, Inamorata, changed that at all for you? It seems like now, at least in that context, you are the model &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the product creator. But it also seems like, and you write about this in the book, there’s a direct line between the sales of the direct-to-consumer swimsuits and whether or not you are actually in the pictures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBmrMN"&gt;Yeah. It definitely feels better to be the one in control and the one making decisions about how I’m going to profit off of my image and my body. And it’s fun to work with other women that I like and make clothes that I like, but it’s... I don’t know if I would say that it’s true empowerment because it’s still capitalism and it’s still selling clothes. So I have problems around the girl boss politics of like, “There you go. That’s feminism. We did it.” It’s just more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc5N1Q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s also true that this project is self-funded — it’s all your own investment. But if we look at the wider world of girl bosses, they’re still having to go to men to ask for more money, to ask for support and investment. It’s hard to get total control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8stxeU"&gt;Yeah and we have not done that yet. I don’t have any outside investors, partly because I just can’t stand the thought of having to convince some guy in a suit to give us money, which is weird because that’s the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFq9Ws"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that you’ll keep modeling for other people if you don’t have to, from a financial perspective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjCt6F"&gt;It’s really hard because the money’s good and I have a kid now and I have a lot of responsibilities and, honestly, writing isn’t exactly an amazing way to make money. So one of the things that I love about modeling and working for other people is that it buys me time — I write about that in the book. Even initially, that was the appeal. My friends had to work really hard at cafes or service industry jobs, and I could go shoot a job one day a week or a month and make what they were making by working many, many hours. And even just being able to write this book was because I had time. So I like the opportunities that modeling allows me. But I think if I could, if I felt financially secure enough, I would absolutely probably stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KI12lU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You figured out early on in your career that there was a real benefit to be had in keeping your weight down and conforming to current standard beauty standards. It reminded me of this line, from Jia Tolentino’s book —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UR1Oax"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trick Mirror&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6l3EA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, exactly. She writes about women looking at their bodies like a McKinsey consultant looks at a corporation, in terms of what can be modified and improved. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptzt2L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a phenomenon I’ve seen with a lot of the young TikTok stars. They get famous in part because they’re very approachable. But then to stay famous, like when they get the Hulu deal, you start to see them conform more and more to beauty standards. I’m curious if that’s something you’ve seen and something you think about with today’s social media stars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gk3SB8"&gt;Yeah, I’m so interested in that phenomenon because I see it all the time. Like now, I’ve been famous for eight-something years and I watch women come in and they have this charm about them and then slowly their boobs get a little bigger or they lose a little bit of weight or their nose gets a little smaller, whatever. And of course they do. They become very hyper aware of how they’re perceived and they know that their value increases the more they fit the mold. So they’re just being smart, which is the sad truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVjy4F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You touch on this, too, in the book. When you’re in a capitalist system, you take the assets you have and you optimize them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8y0ZH"&gt;Yeah, that’s a huge theme of the book. That’s what I feel about any woman deciding to modify her image and body. It’s like, “Of course she wants to do that. That’s the world we live in and it’s a commodifiable asset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ge4VF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a section of the book and in the essay where you talk about some of the comments you’ve received on Instagram, people feeling very entitled to say cruel or very sexual things about your body and your image. I know that there’s an IRL version of this in the modeling industry, but I’m curious if you think about the internet making women particularly vulnerable to that type of harassment or critique and if there’s any real way around that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w009BY"&gt;I don’t think there’s any real way around it. I definitely think that the IRL version is just so different. The things that people say online, no one, even the nastiest person in fashion, would say in real life. It’s what everyone talks about, you’re hiding behind your screen, you think you’re anonymous. Sometimes I’m really shocked. I try not to look at comments, but of course I do sometimes. And I’ll click on someone’s profile because I’m just so curious who this person is that will say this incredibly hurtful and very specific thing. And it’s just a person who’s walking around and I think about what it does for them? I’ve definitely been a fan, but I’ve also always been a public persona as that kind of culture has risen. So I’ve never been able to relate or empathize with people who do that. And it must be satisfying in some way because so many people partake in it — it’s really sad. It says something bad about people’s mental health and where we are as a culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwlpBC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your way of dealing with that? You mentioned you try not to look at the comments. Do you ever try to engage or report them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6ZYP"&gt;No, I don’t. I’ve found, unfortunately, that sometimes the high road is the best road, which doesn’t feel satisfying in the same way that writing a nasty retort would be. This is something I write about in the book. With moments that I’ve protested the use of my image, for example, it ends up just bringing more attention. And so I don’t want to bring attention to that person and their comment, so I try to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzb3CD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious what speaking up about the way that you’ve been treated by powerful men has cost you, if anything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUptNB"&gt;So it’s interesting because one of the first interviews I did around the book was with a man, and he asked me if I was concerned about the consequences for Robin Thicke. I was like, “Wait, for me or for Robin Thicke?” And he was like, “For Robin Thicke.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fULZcR"&gt;Then, out of my control, some media outlet broke an embargo and leaked two sentences from what I hope was a pretty nuanced essay and just put those tag lines out into the world. And it’s been pretty brutal for me online. I would say 99 percent of Twitter is either saying that I’m low on money and therefore that’s why I’m talking about this now, or something about how I was dancing around naked, what did I expect? So the idea that our culture is shifted and that men need to be scared now, I haven’t experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMCO7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was it important for you to wait to speak out about what you’ve experienced until you had a bigger platform? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRKHeu"&gt;I didn’t think about it as speaking out. I felt like, “Okay, this is a perfect example of the full truth of my experience and therefore I want to include it in the book because I want people to understand what I’ve learned about myself and how I’ve evolved as a person.” But it didn’t feel like, “Oh, I’m speaking out.” Blurred Lines my editor basically had to force me to write. Initially, that experience was hidden in another essay — it was like two paragraphs. And it was one of the things that when we first started to dive into the book proposal, she was like, “This needs to be its own essay, it’s such a telling experience.” And I was really afraid that it was going to become what it has in this exact moment before the book’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLL1EW"&gt;In the galley, in the version you read, it was the first essay. I ended up making it the second essay because I just felt like it wasn’t the right thing. I think for me, it just feels like I have had so many people question my reality and question my experience. And I felt so frustrated with it that it wasn’t a choice of like, “I’m going to speak out.” It was just like, “I have to put this thing out into the world to validate my reality.” That was it. I knew there were going to be all these really hard parts about it, but that yearning drove me all the way to where I am now, which is publishing this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJkWli"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has your thinking about the nuances of putting your image on the internet changed since becoming a mom? You tend to block out your baby’s face a lot in Instagram photos. How are you thinking about Sly’s image?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTqXON"&gt;So I actually posted a picture of his face last weekend for the first time. And it was because we live in New York City and paparazzi had shot him, and you could Google his face anyway. And again, taking back control, I don’t like the idea of exploiting my beautiful baby’s image through Instagram. I’ve signed up for this life, but he hasn’t. But he is a part of my life and I also am proud of him and I don’t want other pictures of him that I don’t have control over out there instead. So that was the decision my husband and I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJM0QF"&gt;It might change, I don’t know. I’m learning. I might go to being like, “No, I love sharing pictures of him,” or I might go back to just not showing his face at all. I’m not sure. But that’s where I am in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnTCko"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have anything next on the docket writing-wise? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxzh4w"&gt;I have actually been thinking about writing about putting this book out into the world and cancel culture and media and clickbait culture, and my experience with that. I’ve started to write it and then I just feel pretty exhausted because I’ve been talking about this book so much. Writing it and editing it was such an amazing experience, but publishing it is... I’m not sure what it’s going to be like yet, and I’m nervous about it and I think that’s keeping me from writing. But I definitely plan on writing other books. At this moment in time, I would say that I’d be interested in trying my hand at fiction, just out of self-protection. But I also just really like writing from life, so we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElMITp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you want people to take away from the book? It feels like, with the leaks, people will have their own interpretations. But I would imagine that anyone who really engages with the text will have a really different takeaway. What are you hoping that the message will be for people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5Z849"&gt;That’s nice of you to say. When I’m in a good mood in the last couple days, I’ve been like, “Well, maybe more people will read the book because there’s all this chatter.” I don’t know. That’s the only positive I can take away from that. I really want to start conversations, and I say this in the book, I don’t have answers. I don’t know exactly what feminism or empowerment is. But I do think that women’s experiences, the female experience, what it means to be in a body as a woman, our reality is so frequently dismissed and ignored even by other women. And I do find through my close female friendships, that there is a baseline truth to what we know about our lives and our position in the world. And I want that to become something that is an understood thing between women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xKdbbl"&gt;So I guess my hope is that by putting these really personal vulnerable experiences out in the world, that other women will feel like it gives them permission to talk about their experiences. And instead of feeling like it’s something wrong with them or that they’re so specific, they’ll realize that there’s context for this and there’s a reason that we have so many shared experiences. That’s it, I think. That’s my biggest hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESjcj8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOzG7S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Massive Comcast Xfinity outage disconnects TV and internet across the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile Service Introduces New 5G Unlimited Data Options" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4k4rU5jGGHxRaHByu_zxoR8BAE=/0x0:6036x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116289/1232480552.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p6KDbb"&gt;This morning many Comcast Xfinity subscribers woke up without their usual services. Reports indicate the system was down, or at least unsteady, in areas stretching from Chicago to Philadelphia, New Jersey, and South Carolina. Looking at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/xfinity/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, issues had been reported earlier in the Bay Area, but it’s unclear if those are connected to the problems people saw this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEvQBi"&gt;Comcast has released a statement regarding the outage. According to a spokesperson, “Earlier, some customers experienced intermittent service disruptions as a result of a network issue. We have addressed the issue and service is now restoring for impacted customers, as we continue to investigate the root cause. We apologize to those who were affected.” It appears that most of the people who reported problems have confirmed they’re back online. There’s still no word on exactly what caused the problem or how many people were impacted at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C3XcLc"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Earlier, some customers experienced intermittent service disruptions as a result of a network issue. We have addressed the issue and service is now restoring for impacted customers, as we continue to investigate the root cause. We apologize to those who were affected.&lt;/p&gt;— Xfinity Support (@XfinitySupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XfinitySupport/status/1458113028935794703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSuUCQ"&gt;A message on the company’s outage status page (if you could reach it, which many people couldn’t) noted an issue and said it would be resolved at 10:49AM ET, without revealing why it had such a specific timeline. Customers trying to reach phone support reported only getting a dial tone or error message in response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5m35Z"&gt;Some people, like me, were able to get online this morning without an issue while using Comcast’s cable internet, but the number of reports from home and business customers alike shows the issue was widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtfXmb"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4dScZS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you for reaching out! I do apologize you are experiencing a service interruption in your area.

    <title>Squid Game director confirms season two, says he’s in the ‘planning process’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q47KJC2M5p7RFaCQq-2hRZTURxo=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117293/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_3.32.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CjxZyP"&gt;If you’re still reeling from the end of &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; season one, get ready to board the emotional rollercoaster once again because season two is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="15mw7R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;COMEBACK SQUID: Hwang Dong-hyuk, the director, creator, writer of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SquidGame?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SquidGame&lt;/a&gt; says the show will be back with more Gi-hun adventures. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uqC1DIdZqy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uqC1DIdZqy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/APEntertainment/status/1458060909319004170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBTwH3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; tweeted out a brief clip of an interview with director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who confirms that season two is in the works. “I will say there will indeed be a second season,” Dong-hyuk tells &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; while standing next to Lee Jung-jae, the actor who plays &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;’s beloved protagonist, Gi-hun. “It’s in my head right now. I’m in the planning process currently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFIARu"&gt;It really doesn’t come as a surprise that Netflix gave the series the green light for season two, considering that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;the platform’s most-watched show at launch&lt;/a&gt;, raking in 111 million viewers after airing for just 17 days. &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is such a hit that Netflix even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761602/netflix-squid-game-director-movies"&gt;added three more films directed by Dong-hyuk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzLLH"&gt;“There’s been so much pressure, so much demand, and so much love for a second season. So I almost feel like you leave us no choice,” Dong-hyuk continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UhQ2N"&gt;While Dong-hyuk says that it’s “too early” to determine when or how season two will be released, he did give us a small hint at what’s to come: “I will promise you this: Gi-hun will come back — he will do something for the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
