    <title>The federal government is investigating yet another Tesla Autopilot crash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XSgllG"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating another Tesla crash in which Autopilot was allegedly in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvHHIM"&gt;The crash took place outside of Lansing, Michigan, when the driver of a Tesla Model Y smashed into a state trooper’s cruiser. Michigan police said the driver was using Autopilot, Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), at the time of the crash. No one was injured, but the government sent investigators to the scene to determine how Autopilot may have contributed to the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHfWv"&gt;“NHTSA is aware of the incident involving a Tesla vehicle near Lansing, Michigan,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “Consistent with NHTSA’s vigilant oversight and robust authority over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment, including automated technologies, we have launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nIQuit"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1MvkER"&gt;This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators. NHTSA has sent teams to inspect similar crashes involving Teslas that took place in recent weeks in Houston and Detroit. Local law enforcement has said it doesn’t believe Autopilot was involved in the Detroit crash, but they have yet to make the same determination in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWp8SE"&gt;This is also the latest incident to involve a driver using Autopilot crashing into a stationary object. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629214/tesla-autopilot-crash-death-josh-brown-jeremy-banner"&gt;at least two fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; in which a Tesla owner has smashed into a stopped vehicle, and Tesla has yet to address it in any meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7IjCS"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore. In the past, Tesla has warned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGd0FW"&gt;At the same time, the company recently rolled out a beta version of Autopilot called “Full Self Driving” that has given many people the false impression that Tesla vehicles are autonomous and don’t require drivers to pay attention to the road. Tesla recently expanded the number of people who have access to the beta software. “Still be careful, but it’s getting mature,” CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368017749851598850?s=20"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2T1bGv"&gt;Tesla has a checkered history with the NHTSA, the federal agency that can issue recalls and investigate automobile crashes. The agency has investigated multiple fatal crashes involving Autopilot. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the ADAS was one of the probable causes of a fatal 2018 crash, in which a California man was killed after his Model X smashed into a concrete barrier. Later, the chair of the safety board said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152984/tesla-autopilot-safety-recommendations-ignored-ntsb-crash-hearing"&gt;Tesla was ignoring its recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. And last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530411/teslas-full-self-driving-beta-test-nhtsa"&gt;a spokesperson for NHTSA said the agency was “monitoring”&lt;/a&gt; the rollout of Tesla’s Full Self Driving software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9VpHH"&gt;Safety advocates decried Tesla’s decision to test its driver-assistance software on its customers as irresponsible. The executive director of the Center for Auto Safety accused Tesla of “intentionally misleading the public regarding the capabilities and shortcomings of their technology,” &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2021-03-17/us-sends-investigators-to-probe-another-michigan-tesla-crash"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FO3oyY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton CEO says accident involving treadmill resulted in child’s death</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9HmZLA"&gt;A child was killed in an accident involving the Peloton’s Tread Plus treadmill, &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;Peloton CEO John Foley said&lt;/a&gt; in a note posted to the company website Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNlFzD"&gt;“I’m reaching out to you today because I recently learned about a tragic accident involving a child and the Tread+, resulting in, unthinkably, a death,” Foley wrote. “While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye7EUi"&gt;Peloton declined to provide further details about the child, the incident, or the “handful of previous incidents” Foley referenced. The company said in a statement that everyone at the company was saddened by the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIWfu4"&gt;The company’s statement adds that the Tread Plus was designed and tested for use by people over 16 and weighing more than 105 pounds. “Additionally, when the Tread+ is not in use Members should continue to follow the safety instructions by storing the safety key, which keeps the Tread+ from operating, away from the Tread+ and out of reach of children,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6fENp"&gt;Foley warned that children and pets should be kept “away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.” He also said the company is “currently assessing ways to reinforce our warnings about these critical safety precautions to hopefully prevent future accidents.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIzBXL"&gt;Despite their somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;expensive price tags&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton’s stationary bikes and treadmills have been hugely popular during the coronavirus pandemic, with most gyms closed and people social distancing at home. The company reported that &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/1d578332-048e-4b0c-8909-b532c100f65d"&gt;its revenue increased 66 percent&lt;/a&gt; year over year in the first three months of 2020. The company &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-customers-complain-delays-cancellations-during-lockdown-2020-6?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with the demand for its products early on, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYfl6O"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Peloton-Recalls-PR70P-Bike-Pedals-Due-to-Laceration-Hazard-Recall-Alert?inline-read-more"&gt;Peloton issued a recall&lt;/a&gt; for clip-in pedals on about 27,000 of its bikes following reports of broken pedals that caused injuries, including several that required medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtbfrR"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/the-danger-of-treadmills/"&gt;25,000 children are injured&lt;/a&gt; annually in home exercise-related equipment accidents. One of the most common types of injury is friction burns that happen when a child touches a moving belt on a machine. In 2009, boxer Mike Tyson’s four-year-old daughter, Exodus, was &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=7677067"&gt;killed in a treadmill accident&lt;/a&gt; after a cord wrapped around her neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7G2tc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd9q4d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Barnes &amp; Noble will reveal a Lenovo-made Nook tablet next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/32xbMsLNfiu72kJ82P8VBmQc0iE=/76x0:889x542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989378/NOOKphoto.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JPlW6b"&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s line of Nook e-readers isn’t dead yet. The company has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that despite running out of stock, it still plans to sell its Kindle competitors once new units arrive in stores later this spring. In fact, there’s a previously unannounced tablet that the company will imminently reveal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDj0b6"&gt;Susan McCulloch, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s senior director for Nook operations, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company will bring back its Nook tablet line with “a new NOOK tablet designed with Lenovo” that it will reveal next week. Barnes &amp;amp; Noble’s most recent Nook tablet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/5/18065106/barnes-and-noble-nook-tablet-10-1-release-price"&gt;was the $129 10.1-inch Nook&lt;/a&gt;, its largest Android tablet ever. But it, along with every other Android tablet from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble, has been &lt;a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/barnes-and-noble-nook-ereader-news/will-barnes-and-noble-sell-tablets-again"&gt;unavailable to purchase since last July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5mR51"&gt;Currently, the Nook GlowLight 3 and GlowLight Plus e-readers share a similar fate, as both are listed as completely sold out online. It’s apparently the first time both products have been unavailable at the same time, according to &lt;a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/barnes-and-noble-nook-ereader-news/barnes-and-noble-nook-e-readers-are-sold-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good e-Reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Some stores still list in-store stock available, which has led to speculation that Barnes &amp;amp; Noble might be discontinuing the Nook line entirely — something we’ve seen happen before with products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;like Apple’s HomePod&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyqTnX"&gt;But the lack of stock is actually due to “exceptionally strong” sales of the two products, which McCulloch credits to an increase in reading over the past year. “As problems go, of course, this is a bitter-sweet one for a retailer,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4ksCx"&gt;That would be impressive, given the Nook GlowLight 3 and GlowLight Plus are more than slightly outdated. (The GlowLight 3 was released in 2017, while the larger GlowLight Plus is almost two years old.) But it seems the dwindling supply is just due to increased demand, as opposed to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble planning refreshed models or an exit from the e-reader business entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xi3QK"&gt;Despite the odds, instead of folding, it seems the Nook brand is about to get yet another refresh in the coming weeks. Barnes &amp;amp; Noble isn’t letting its older e-reader hardware or the incredibly oversaturated Android tablet market stand in its way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NYT Cooking Facebook group was half-baked, so the Times is throwing it out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yTzO9ZG4_0hbKDRGRye_kxqDp0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989310/acastro_180501_1777_facebook_dating_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="egtEAb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Cooking Facebook group will soon no longer bear the name of the publication: the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; has given up on controlling it and is taking its name off the group. According to a note posted in the group &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbiba/status/1372380021483048969"&gt;(which was then reposted to Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;, control of the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nytcooks/"&gt;private 77,000-member Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; will be given over to members of the community who are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6FUhn"&gt;The reactions from members of the group have been... something else, with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbiba/status/1372389826620690433?s=20"&gt;one commenter saying&lt;/a&gt; the group was full of “Aunt Lydias” (a reference to the dystopian rule enforcers of &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;) and “hall monitors.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ITooAmRJ/status/1372516315777351687?s=20"&gt;Another said&lt;/a&gt; they would delete the group, “freeing us all from this retched prison,” if given moderation powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaEJ5I"&gt;In a post to the group by the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;announcing the change, the company explains that it had become clear the group was interested in “much more than recipes or The New York Times.” While it’s understandable that moderating a special-interest group can be difficult in the best of circumstances, according to journalist Erin Biba, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbiba/status/1372384590481010689?s=20"&gt;there were only four moderators&lt;/a&gt; to supervise the nearly 80,000 users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fja2bs"&gt;As for why the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;stepped away from the private group, it doesn’t seem like the decision was made in reaction to a specific incident. &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist Ben Smith &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1372550435836399616?s=20"&gt;reached out&lt;/a&gt; to the paper’s assistant managing editor, Sam Sifton, to ask why the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; was backing away from the group, and he responded that it is because the group was “a lot of people who want to post pictures of their dogs next to their soufflé.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fezl9M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;OK, I have reported this out. Per &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamSifton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SamSifton&lt;/a&gt;, there was no precipitating crisis, simply a realization that "it's a lot of people who want to post pictures of their dogs next to their soufflé" and "not a place where we were going to March people toward NYT Cooking." 1/&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Smith (@benyt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benyt/status/1372560011503734797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hFdQNx"&gt;The group has &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/new-york-times-cooking-facebook-group-turned-political"&gt;run into moderation issues before&lt;/a&gt;. It had a “no political views” rule, which a member broke around election season after a post advocating for a certain candidate. It seems that now, the group will have to decide for itself what it wants to be, separate from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yzEJRR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am ready for the New York Times Cooking Community autonomous zone &lt;a href="https://t.co/roGDjJaH5e"&gt;https://t.co/roGDjJaH5e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— julia reinstein   (@juliareinstein) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliareinstein/status/1372388249461739520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwNG-IZlsQ-fDdzznC3mgjeo4Dw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68989131/16BR_Gameplay_Screenshots_BP_Still16_1920x1080_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Epic’s chief creative officer, Donald Mustard, explains the game’s bold narrative ambitions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="krQ4CX"&gt;Why does &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; have a narrative? It’s a game where 100 players drop onto a cartoonish island, dress up as bananas or &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;heroes, gather up guns and other gear, and attempt to eliminate each other until only one remains. When that’s done, you queue up and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUeYnc"&gt;But within this multiplayer shooter framework, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has steadily turned into one of the biggest and boldest storytelling experiments in history. From &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21921491/fortnite-galactus-live-event-player-count"&gt;live events experienced by millions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336542/fortnite-season-6-opening-russo-brothers-avengers"&gt;cinematics created with the help of Hollywood directors&lt;/a&gt;, the team at Epic has continuously tested new ideas, injecting narrative elements in a way that feels natural and meaningful. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is among the biggest games in the world and arguably the most culturally impactful. And for Donald Mustard, chief creative officer at Epic Games, it was a chance he couldn’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVFXyw"&gt;“For me, it was an opportunity to almost create a new medium,” Mustard tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnzEqw"&gt;That focus on storytelling is particularly obvious now, after the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22332371/fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-primal-battle-pass-tomb-raider-neymar"&gt;the game’s most recent season&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time, players were able to play through a single-player mission — a brief, action-filled sequence in which they were guided by a glowing butterfly to help restore reality. It featured more traditional hallmarks of video game narrative, like dialogue and cutscenes. And for Mustard, it’s something he’s been working toward for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6DXEP"&gt;“We’re three and a half years in essentially, and now is when it’s finally okay to be like, ‘There’s this guy named Agent Jones. Here’s what’s going on a little bit. Oh look, they’re actually talking.’ But for so much of it, it was very, very subtle. But it’ll become less subtle moving forward,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwvf6E"&gt;The idea of telling a story in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t new. Mustard says it was part of the plan from the beginning, ever since &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s battle royale mode first launched in September 2017. And it wasn’t just an afterthought — it was a key element of the experience. “Our approach since the start, or our goal, has been how do we create truly mass-scale, broad-based entertainment. And I always think that the way to do that is through narrative conceit,” Mustard explains. “It might not necessarily be story in the traditional character-driven, three-act structure. But the conceits, and the why of what’s going on and what’s happening, are critical for people to be emotionally attached to an entertainment experience. That’s our guiding principle and philosophy,” he says. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has a story because all great entertainment has a good story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8TfdWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Fortnite’ has a story because all great entertainment has a good story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MKwNq9"&gt;The challenge has been &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to tell that story. Since &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is a multiplayer game where players are mostly concerned with surviving and shooting, storytelling, by design, cannot be as straightforward. For one, outside of the live spectacles, players typically aren’t seeing events unfold. Instead, they’re seeing the effects of events that have already taken place, maybe in the form of a new location or item. “That story is happening, but you’re only seeing some of it,” says Mustard. “You’re only seeing the results of it happening around you, rather than seeing everything that Agent Jones is doing or The Seven are doing. There’s all this stuff that’s been happening and is progressing. And a lot of times, you’re out in the world seeing the results of some of those things, but not necessarily the moments that led to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UbbuC"&gt;And while there are important characters in the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe, the narrative isn’t told from any one particular perspective. There isn’t an actual protagonist — or at least, not an obvious one. “Most linear stories are told through the lens of a character,” explains Mustard. “&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is an awesome universe, but really it’s about the journey of Luke and these characters. You care so much about these characters and their journey, and it happens to take place in this fantastical, awesome backdrop that you care about as well. But it’s really that lens. And most stories are told in that direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAG5cA"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, that main character isn’t Peely or Agent Jones or any of the other now-iconic faces from the game. Instead, it’s the island itself. “The world of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is the main character,” says Mustard. “I will give that an arc, I will give that a journey, and if we do it right, what would happen? Would you become invested in that character? That’s why when stuff happened, like a comet came, I wanted it to affect the character. It’s going to leave a permanent mark. The comet’s going to leave a huge hole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TupEx9Bz00Aq9hvc6UXBUkCpgSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380551/16BR_Gameplay_Screenshots_BP_Still9_1920x1080_logo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwIgYe"&gt;One of the most powerful narrative tools used in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is environmental storytelling. It’s a game of big events — a rocket launch, a battle between towering monsters, a black hole — and each leaves a permanent impression on the island. After the rocket launched in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521122/fortnite-rocket-launch-epic-games-dimensional-rift"&gt;there was a visible crack in the sky&lt;/a&gt;. Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot"&gt;the mech versus kaiju battle&lt;/a&gt;, a monstrous skeleton became a new location to visit. And the black hole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;essentially introduced a new lead character&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a new island. This island is a place where players come together to hang out and shoot at each other, but it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18537469/fortnite-map-island-history-neo-tilted-volcano"&gt;a virtual world brimming with its own strange history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzPWjX"&gt;Mustard says the game does have a plot with a beginning and end, and that he knows exactly where everything’s headed. But because of the nature of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the path to those big story beats can change dramatically depending on what players do or say. He likens it to telling a campfire story, where you might adjust the trajectory of the narrative based on the reactions of your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YJjVkb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A story that feels like it’s being told in a moment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NSrM9W"&gt;“We’re trying as much as possible to tell you a story that feels like it’s being told in a moment,” Mustard explains. “You and I are sitting around a campfire at night, and I’m like ‘So we were out in the woods, and I heard a noise…’ The story feels like it’s being shaped in the moment, and it’s being shaped by the way you’re reacting to the story as it’s being told to you. I can tell ‘Oh, that joke didn’t land right.’ It’s a little more improv.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSnih2"&gt;As an example, he notes the big comet crash in 2018. Many players predicted the space rock would wipe out Tilted Towers, one of the game’s most iconic locations. That was never the actual plan — but after seeing this reaction from players, artists from Epic created a handful of handheld signs about the impending devastation, which were &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ejjti/these_signs_on_a_roof_in_tilted_towers/"&gt;placed on a rooftop in Tilted&lt;/a&gt;. “That was us changing the story, or changing the experience, based on how we saw everyone reacting,” Mustard says. “And we do that a lot, as much as we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoV0wO"&gt;More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;starting with the Marvel-themed season last year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s narrative has also increasingly involved other entertainment properties. In season 5, a mysterious phenomenon called the Zero Point created rifts in reality where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;characters from different fictional universes could come together on the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a great way to sell skins for everything from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;. But Mustard says that it’s also a critical part of the storyline, nodding to something he and others at Epic have eagerly talked about creating — the Metaverse, comprised of characters and storylines from countless films, shows, and games all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zos4wdW9UBIrWhSvtbm5pN_mr7U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380556/The_Spire_alt.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uUnO2P"&gt;“I knew, ultimately, that a big part of the story we would tell is these overlapping realities,” he explains. “It’s about the Zero Point and what that is and why that is and how it tethers reality together. I knew the only way to do that right was to somehow convince all these other people to come play with us, to come play in our fictional universe.” As for how those licensed tie-ins come about? “It’s pretty much me going to Kevin Feige and Dan Buckley and Jim Lee, all these amazing creators, and saying: ‘Here’s the story of what we’re trying to tell in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the vision of what it is. Do you want to be part of it with us?’ And a lot of people have said yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cBlEmI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m just excited for the medium.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ukKxyZ"&gt;Between live events, single-player missions, environmental storytelling, and more traditional techniques like cinematics, audio logs, and nonplayer characters you can chat with, Epic is trying all kinds of ways to get this story across. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;an upcoming &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; comic series that will provide even more detail on the island&lt;/a&gt;. That said, more than three years into this experiment, Mustard says the team is still figuring out what works best. But he believes &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; could well be a harbinger of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcQZ5C"&gt;“Our lofty goal is to create the entertainment experience of the future. I think some of that is feeling our way into what feels like it’s going to be a new medium, where it’s this blended entertainment experience that has interactive elements. It has linear elements to it. It has things that would look more like a concert,” Mustard explains. “We’ve discovered some of the ways to do that in a cool way, but I think there’s a lot more for us to discover and experiment with and try. I remain committed to just trying crazy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Ioav18"&gt;“Other people will experiment, too, and we can learn from that. I’m just excited for the medium. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is an indicator of what could be.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFBmGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is restocking both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; today at 3PM ET, while supplies last. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7uq4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Walmart will have PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks available today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMrzmx"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been quite challenging to find ever since its launch in November. And when it is available, sales have been, for the most part, limited to online-only, with stock selling out almost instantly. Despite this, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are dedicated to helping you keep track of when and where the PS5 is available in the hopes you can get another shot at buying Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3Drq"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy either the PS5 (with a disc drive) or the PS5 Digital Edition, as well as any bundles that are not price surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAoRYi"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers selling the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ca5R3n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"How the PS5’s DualSense controller makes games like Fortnite and NBA 2K21 better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy a PS5 right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JG5DCV"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734517183541536443#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times in the week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2F11108140.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in particular. If you are looking for a bundle, retailers like Antonline and Newegg are likely to sell PS5 bundles instead of the actual console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjSIu6"&gt;We have noticed that restocks for the console are more likely to happen later in the week as opposed to earlier in the week. Additionally, places like Newegg are combatting the demand for this console by doing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle%3Fnm_mc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_source%3Dafc-Vox%2BMedia%26AFFID%3D3430747%26AFFNAME%3DVox%2BMedia%26ACRID%3D1%26ASUBID%3Dverge%26ASID%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252F%26ranMID%3D44583%26ranEAID%3D3430747%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-XXgkPukHSHvtb9QuMXSZWQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly selects winners interested in buying sought-after products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V99T63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7oDuAk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaigG6Zpq6Ebg4PHlmyTd-pJL2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990376/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every PS5 comes with one DualSense controller, but you can use the DualShock 4 controller, but it is only limited to when you’re playing PS4 games on the next-gen console. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the PS5?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i98dsO"&gt;The PS5 includes all the basic things you need to get started (minus the games, of course). However, you might want to consider picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand-new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UsvWd"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense&lt;/a&gt; controller. But there are a few benefits to owning at least one additional controller, such as if you plan to play local co-op games with a friend or family member. Or, if you are like me and want to keep playing your game but don’t want to be tethered to the charging cable, a second control lets you continue playing while the other one charges. Normally, $70, we have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen the controller go down as low as $60&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MF1y0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwJaY2"&gt;The PS5 HD Camera is a neat accessory for people interested in using their PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast their gameplay with friends.  It includes dual 1080p lenses and allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XqsPQY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyqMlw"&gt;I strongly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already done so; outside of taking advantage of some online gaming functionalities, PlayStation Plus provides a ton of additional incentives, most notably PS5 owners have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of some of the most impactful titles to release on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPQIiW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVuP0t"&gt;The PS5 comes with a 825GB of available storage right now and unfortunately, there’s no way to expand the fast internal storage currently. Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Playstation-Portable-External-STGD4000400/dp/B076826S5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8ULn9w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to use your Echo with two Amazon accounts</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlEnVo"&gt;If you’ve got an Alexa device in your home, like an Echo smart speaker, anyone in your home can use it. But there are certain disadvantages to having it associated with only one account. Mainly, it means that everyone is pretty much sharing the same account.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrmptJ"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;nodeId=GX3EC6SJYEPVNJKS&amp;amp;qid=1616090965&amp;amp;sr=1-2"&gt;create what Amazon calls a “household.”&lt;/a&gt; That means that there can be two adult accounts on the device. On an Echo, that means it can display photos and allow notifications (for example, for a to-do list) from both accounts. Creating a household also permits one member of the household to make a purchase using the other’s account, which can be useful if one person has a Prime account. (You can add a code if you’d rather not allow the other household member to make purchases.) And outside of an Alexa device, having a household lets you share digital content such as ebooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udaPSZ"&gt;There are a few limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDXQTD"&gt;First, you can only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201628040"&gt;add one other adult (or teenager) to a household account&lt;/a&gt;. You can add up to four teens age 13–17 (who can shop on their own with parents approving the purchases). You can also add four children age 12 and under via the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; plan, which costs $4.99 a month (or $2.99 a month for Prime members) for a single child and $9.99 a month (or $6.99 a month for Prime members) for up to four children. Also, don’t confuse this with Amazon Household, the service attached to a general Amazon account, which allows two adults, up to four teens, and up to four child profiles to share an account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWnUOP"&gt;Here’s how to add someone to your household:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Szr82P"&gt;Go to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/myh/households?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Household&lt;/a&gt; page on the Amazon website. (You can no longer add a household member using the Amazon app.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6BqmZC"&gt;Select “Add Adult” (or “Add a Teen” or “Add a Child”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Add Adult” to add someone to your household" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_yrL0Gev_Nr4jMWYVAqtjt_j48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380118/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.41.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Add Adult” to add someone to your household.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="90v0a5"&gt;Add the name and email of the adult you want to share the account with. They will be invited to join your Amazon Household. (A teen will also get an invite; you will need to create a child’s profile yourself.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your new Household member will be send an email" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VYnqEWFOrz_vMSCwYcIjJznUy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380119/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_11.41.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your new household member will be sent an email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2AAaTj"&gt;Once that’s done, to go from one account to another, you just have to say, “Alexa, switch accounts.” (If you’ve lost track of whose account you’re using, you can say, “Alexa, identify account.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MEu8CJ"&gt;Remove a second account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SqX96n"&gt;What if you no longer want the other adult on your account? (Breakups do happen.) You can easily remove them from your household:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U8Hj3k"&gt;Go to the same “Manage your Household” page on the Amazon site. On the left, you’ll see icons representing you and the other member of your household.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BByErR"&gt;You can either select “Leave” to leave the household yourself or “Remove” to remove somebody from your household. Be aware that any adult leaving or removed from a household won’t be able to join another for 180 days (in other words, six months). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To remove a Household member, go to the “Manage Your Household” page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOoPNwxB-dVkvDyHOkEyddE9mrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22380196/Screen_Shot_2021_03_18_at_12.01.27_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To remove a household member, go to the “Manage Your Household” page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D0iezK"&gt;That 180-day restriction could be a problem if, for example, you’re simply trying to transfer a household member to a different account or if you’ve accidentally removed somebody. In either case, it’s a good idea to contact &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us/ref=hp_gt_comp_cu"&gt;Amazon customer support via chat or phone&lt;/a&gt;. According to a customer service rep I chatted with, Amazon can remove a household member without imposing the 180-day ban if requested. And if you’ve already removed one, it can reset the account so that you can add another before the six-month period is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSDfwI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021, 2:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on November 19th, 2019, and has been updated to accommodate changes in Amazon’s Household plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing letting you watch YouTube videos right from a tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IL59lRqy4HDmmpBmmv5olUettGg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68988808/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJmY3p"&gt;Twitter is testing a way to let you watch YouTube videos right from your timeline. Typically, when someone includes a YouTube link in a tweet, clicking that link sends you to YouTube, which can be frustrating if you didn’t want to leave Twitter to watch the video. This new feature, which is in testing today on iOS, means you won’t be sent away from Twitter, which will make it easier to watch a video and then keep on scrolling if you so choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfBmko"&gt;Twitter shared how the feature works &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381"&gt;in a GIF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wn3Xrw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today on iOS, we’re testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly in your Home timeline, without leaving the conversation on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/V4qzMJMEBs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V4qzMJMEBs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mrJuHw"&gt;The test will be available to “a very small group of users” in Canada, the US, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, Twitter said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we first published this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rA80x"&gt;“The current test on iOS will be a four-week experiment,” a Twitter spokesperson said. We plan to take a look at the results and will scale accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4bRVr"&gt;This new test arrives alongside two others announced last week for iOS and Android that are intended to improve sharing and viewing media on the social network. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;One test&lt;/a&gt; adds a “what you see is what you get” image preview in the tweet composer, meaning images appear in your timeline as they do when you’re drafting a tweet. The company is also testing ways to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680674672807940"&gt;upload and view 4K images&lt;/a&gt; on mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="raEFVx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="AADWtD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2:56PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added information from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MDr2JX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 18th, 2021 2:19PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; plans to restock both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; today at 2:30PM ET, while supplies last. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uEhwA5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Walmart will have PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks available today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338157/playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restocks-walmart-time-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eQ3cRD"&gt;Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles, the Xbox Series X and Series S, came out in November, but buying one even now has been challenging due to the pandemic. If you have a hard time keeping up with restocks on where to buy either console, don’t worry. We are here to help you keep tabs and better your chances of securing either next-gen Xbox console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkhtST"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3eON2"&gt;We will also note any opportunities to buy either Xbox console through the Xbox All Access Plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EJuT6Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy an Xbox Series X / Series S right now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="HcJ9BE"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including Best Buy and Target, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times throughout a week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734069351763648754#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x%2FB224744V.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F8wj714n3rbtl%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, in particular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN6oHa"&gt;The Xbox Series S costs $300 and is currently the most affordable ninth-generation home gaming console. It is smaller, less powerful, and lacks a disc drive, limiting you to only playing digital games. The $500 Xbox Series X serves as Microsoft’s flagship gaming console, including a disc drive and more powerful hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cB7Zs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="THxZFV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Xbox Series X / Series S? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W5MxWn"&gt;Whether you purchase the most affordable next-gen console (the Xbox Series S) or Microsoft’s most powerful gaming console to date (Series X), they share many accessories that will help you get the most out of your experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I206y0"&gt;If you plan to share this console and play local co-op games with family or friends, the purchase of an additional controller is a must. Normally $60, the new Xbox controller does get discounted sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="arsXD4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vBlyA0"&gt;If you are planning to subscribe to both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Live-Gold-Membership-Digital/dp/B002VBWIP6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Live Gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;, I recommend consolidating those separate purchases and subscribing to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. It combines both services into one package, while also providing additional access to Game Pass for PC and access to Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kFcOAU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STmdtT"&gt;When it comes to additional storage, both consoles are rather limited: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the Series X. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, but it is very expensive, costing $220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTSdyQ"&gt;There is a solution that can alleviate this until additional SSD options are made available — specifically, using an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally, I would suggest buying an external hard drive if you plan to play some older games so you don’t use up your limited SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LKeRlK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="FLyqG6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A new Life is Strange is coming in September, and the original is being remastered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QEsN-L4O8v0WgudtfcToPOABnc=/0x138:3840x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68988454/LiS_TrueColors_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="84Ug4P"&gt;During today’s Square Enix Presents live stream, the company announced the next main entry in the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange &lt;/em&gt;series, called &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt;, will arrive on September 10th, 2021 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and Stadia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3lYIa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors is &lt;/em&gt;developed by Deck Nine, a studio that previously worked on &lt;em&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors,&lt;/em&gt; players control Alex Chen, an Asian American woman who has a supernatural ability to “experience, absorb, and manipulate” the strong emotions other people experience. The story will focus on Alex as she tries to embrace her power to figure out the mystery surrounding her brother’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e5qLg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;All episodes for ‘Life is Strange: True Colors’ will be available at launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xYaqbK"&gt;Unlike previous games in the series, all episodes for &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; will be available at launch, meaning you can play the full game on launch day or use chapter breaks to tackle one episode at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20NTAq"&gt;Additionally, Square Enix announced the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange Remastered Collection&lt;/em&gt;: a compilation that includes enhanced versions of the original &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; and its prequel, &lt;em&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/em&gt;. The remastered collection will feature remastered visuals and improved character animations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhX4fY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is Strange Remastered Collection&lt;/em&gt; has no release date yet, but Square Enix is aiming to release the game sometime this fall on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia. Those who purchase &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors&lt;/em&gt;’ Ultimate Edition will receive a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Remastered Collection&lt;/em&gt;, but the game will also be available as a standalone purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
