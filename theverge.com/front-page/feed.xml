    <title>Impossible Foods eyes schools for new customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2nd China International Import Expo (CIIE) - Day 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRIV5LrRvrcoS5w6deNAM8vlbbw=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253559/1186664879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Impossible Burgers sit on a tray at the Impossible Foods Inc. booth on day five of the 2nd China International Import Expo (CIIE) at the National Exhibition and Convention Center on November 9, 2019 in Shanghai, China. | Photo by Gao Yuwen/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HhKWO4"&gt;Impossible Burgers will be making their way onto school menus across the US. The meatless burger just received the Child Nutrition Label from the USDA, which could make it easier for public schools to serve the product because the Impossible Burgers will be eligible for national school lunch funding. Impossible Foods hopes to offer up protein-packed lunches that don’t generate as much greenhouse gases as red meat. But slapping branding on foods served up to kids can still be harmful, even if the meals might be better for the environment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kv8XkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Companies should really keep their branding out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gxjz7"&gt;“Just on principle, we believe that schools should be commercial free,” says Marlene Schwartz, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. “Companies should really keep their branding out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwEwuu"&gt;Adults can carry loyalties to brands that they’re exposed to as kids, &lt;a href="https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/how-childhood-advertising-exposure-can-create-biased-product-eval"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown. That’s not great for their health if they’re developing a taste for junk food, so advocates have pushed for more nutritious options, including plant-based foods, in schools. Impossible Burgers are plant-based and have gotten the green light from the Food and Drug Administration to be sold in grocery stores (despite some activists’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418036/impossible-foods-legal-battle-key-ingredient-heme-fda"&gt;concerns over its key genetically engineered ingredient&lt;/a&gt;, heme, that the company says makes its burgers “taste like meat”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEspOV"&gt;The problem that Schwartz sees with Impossible Foods’ move into schools has more to do with its branding than with its product. (She’s unable to comment on whether Impossible Burgers are any better or worse than other foods.) If schools want to serve meals with less meat and a smaller carbon footprint, then they should serve the meatless patties without the Impossible trademark, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ANtFA"&gt;“When you allow a giant corporation to use that setting to get their brand in front of kids … It’s completely in conflict with the purpose of schools in the first place and I just think it’s completely unfair,” Schwartz says. “There’s something sacred about the school environment, that it should be a place where students aren’t being pressured to buy particular products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ueMGVv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Impossible™ Frito Pie”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1DFCu"&gt;Schools in Palo Alto, California; Aberdeen, Washington; Edmond, Oklahoma; and Union City, Oklahoma, will start pilot programs serving Impossible Burgers this month. The product won’t just appear in a bun, either. There will be “Impossible™ Street Tacos,” “Impossible™ Frito Pie,” and “Spaghetti with Impossible™ Meat Sauce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilOsfR"&gt;Impossible Foods seems to want to take more schools by storm soon. “Making Impossible™ products available everywhere people consume meat, which for kids often includes schools, is key to the mission of the company,” Pat Brown, CEO and Founder of Impossible Foods, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210506005414/en/Impossible-Foods-Secures-Child-Nutrition-Label-for-Impossible%E2%84%A2-Burger-Launches%C2%A0-Insights-Report-on-Kids-Climate-Change"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgbgk6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTMQRr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon and T-Mobile want your business more than ever right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTzrv5sYQQxZijH2KvfJrbK-GNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253302/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;US telecom companies are braced for expensive changes in the coming years — and by extension, so are the rest of us.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Expect generous promotions and shiny new plans as the expensive 5G buildout continues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PCj6nX"&gt;It’s a good year for old, crappy phones. The dusty old phone in your desk drawer running Android frozen-dessert-something-or-other — the one that might have a cracked screen — saw its stock go up recently with two generous trade-in promotions. T-Mobile and Verizon are both offering to take your old, damaged phone off your hands and replace it with a shiny new 5G model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUwvCI"&gt;There are a couple of reasons for this generosity. Verizon, in particular, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;written some big checks&lt;/a&gt; to pay for new C-band frequencies — highly desirable spectrum for 5G that offers good range and speed. The company has reassured its shareholders that the hefty expenditure will help grow its customer base and increase the amount of money it makes on existing accounts. It told investors at its March analyst event that “with C-band included, we think step-ups to premium [plans] will only accelerate.” So it’s unsurprising that the cracked phone deal requires a commitment to a “select unlimited plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="U0WiyG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long, lucrative relationship&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ByLkC"&gt;Meanwhile, T-Mobile wants to make the most of a relatively strong hand right now. It has taken every opportunity possible to declare itself the “leader in 5G” and is likewise focused on reaching new customers, getting a 5G device in their hands, and getting them hooked on its 5G network. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert talked up the success of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;new Magenta Max plan&lt;/a&gt; — an unlimited plan that doesn’t impose slowdowns after you reach a certain monthly data threshold — on the company’s first quarter earnings call as a kind of “if you build it, they will come” moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhtIFy"&gt;Customers on the plan use 70 percent more data than a typical LTE customer, and Sievert says they’re using their 5G data connection in situations when they might otherwise have looked for a public Wi-Fi network to join. “When you give somebody a true unlimited plan on a 5G phone that’s screaming fast on the biggest and best 5G network in this country, they use it.” That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long and, ultimately, lucrative relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzcTYa"&gt;Outside of those two companies, US wireless carriers across the board are braced for big changes this year — the impact of which will be felt by the rest of us in one way or another. The beginning of the year saw telecom companies on the upswing compared to last year’s tumultuous first quarter, with most adding more customers than they did in this quarter last year. T-Mobile gained a net of 773,000 postpaid phone customers, and AT&amp;amp;T added 595,000, its highest number in 10 years. Across the industry, companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to welcome customers with stimulus checks ready to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPuCJp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to customers with stimulus checks to spend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VHnP2f"&gt;While they’re in a better spot than they were when the country started shutting down this time a year ago, there are major hurdles to overcome in the near future. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, have a major project ahead of them in getting ready to deploy that newly won C-band — a costly venture on top of what they owe the federal government for the licenses. C-band is particularly important to those two companies, which are gambling on it to breathe life into their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;struggling nationwide 5G networks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYBUA3"&gt;Verizon is wasting no time; having pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, it’s on track to spend between $2 and 3 billion by the end of the year and says it’s already ordered half of the equipment it will need. AT&amp;amp;T, meanwhile, is proceeding with a more cautious outlook, citing uncertainties around stressed global supply chains, and that other auctions this year could help fill out the company’s spectrum portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PTDKZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon has pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuENHA"&gt;Meanwhile, this is all the more motivation for T-Mobile to push aggressively for more subscribers now while the other players catch up to its relatively strong position in spectrum holdings. The company &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Raises-2021-Guidance-as-Network-Leadership-Fuels-Industry-Leading-Growth-with-Strong-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;raised its investor guidance&lt;/a&gt; and now expects to add a net of between 4.4 and 4.9 million postpaid customers this year, up from 4.0 to 4.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVc1pi"&gt;There’s another storm on the horizon, too, one that could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of wireless customers: T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;impending shutdown of its old CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, which a large number of Boost Mobile (owned now by Dish) customers rely on. Dish says that T-Mobile is moving ahead with the shutdown much earlier than it said it would as an anti-competitive tactic, and Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks, more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;calling Sievert a “Magenta Grinch.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6oc8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1rBXS"&gt;The company has also asked the California Public Utilities Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;reopen the Sprint / T-Mobile merger case&lt;/a&gt;, and it has appealed to Capitol Hill lawmakers to review the situation. If the shutdown goes ahead as currently planned, lots of Boost Mobile customers will be shopping for a new phone soon — and potentially even a new wireless provider, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0ectx"&gt;So what’s next? For one, we can expect the aggressive play for new customers to continue, along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;dull roar of the 5G Hype Machine&lt;/a&gt; we’re all tired of hearing by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6ScUNY"&gt;In addition to the device offers, your carrier might try to upsell you to one of those premium unlimited plans if you do upgrade to a 5G device. Verizon is committed to those customer “step-ups,” and Sievert hinted that more Magenta Max-type offerings may be on the way, saying the plan is “only the beginning.” So if you do decide to dust off that old phone and turn it in for a new device this year, more power to you — might as well put an old piece of tech to work for you. Just be sure to take a good look at the fine print on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Assistant will sing you a song about getting vaccinated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Assistant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q1XT27l8npf8ZyfN8F364VSvaRo=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253157/acastro_180510_1777_google_assistant_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G0uqwM"&gt;Many of us are excited that COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available in the US, and it seems like Google Assistant is joining in. In fact, it’s got a song to share about it (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/07/google-assistant-hopes-the-medium-of-song-will-persuade-you-to-get-a-covid-vaccine/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9svoPD"&gt;You can listen to the song yourself by asking Google Assistant to “sing the vaccine song,” but I’ve also recorded it. Take a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PadBRX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy Friday, here’s a song &lt;a href="https://t.co/hetzPYP8QD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hetzPYP8QD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1390714375447584770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tngQgk"&gt;Okay, hmm... where to start? I’ll give the music some props. It’s got a fun beat with a kind of crispy-sounding snare. I’d also call the synths “tastefully restrained.” Assistant will also, I discovered, sing the song in either a male- or female-sounding voice, depending on your settings. The range!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rttDN5"&gt;Unfortunately, the lyrics aren’t great. If you’re not able to listen, here’s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Let’s celebrate that we have the vaccine To help us bring a change to this old routine It can help us build our immunities While taking care of our communities" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vvqNVEUSGOsRQIJJM9_epaA4OfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498904/Screenshot_20210507_101654.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be fair, the subject matter doesn’t lend itself well to song.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xwphiB"&gt;Yeah, the presentation isn’t really helped by the emoji that punctuate each line. I can fully support the message: my hat’s off to the people who worked hard on developing the vaccines, and we should all get it so we can return back to normal. But I don’t think the best messenger is a digital assistant. I also doubt it’ll be that convincing to people who are distrustful of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKUxYH"&gt;(Also, who’s pining for handshakes to come back?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz7gBi"&gt;I’m feeling a strong four to a light five on this one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google goes nuclear against Roku by adding YouTube TV to the main YouTube app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pb5quvxP-CvBjZR-tuSKdVLlwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253022/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ty3nbu"&gt;A week after their broken-down negotiations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412430/roku-youtube-tv-google-feud-explainer-timeline"&gt;spilled into the public&lt;/a&gt;, Google and Roku still haven’t been able to reach a deal to renew YouTube TV’s presence on the huge streaming platform. But Google has come up with something of a workaround in the meantime: it’s going to let people access YouTube TV directly from the main YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdp0O4"&gt;YouTube users will start seeing a “Go to YouTube TV” option in the main YouTube app over the next few days. When they select that, they’ll then be switched over to the standard YouTube TV user experience. This option is coming to Roku devices first — where it’s currently most needed — but will also come to YouTube on other platforms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60xc5D8nnFQBEoj2MbMl-dfkvQU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498898/Untitled_presentation__5_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ykhp1d"&gt;In essence, Google has basically stuffed the YouTube TV app into YouTube itself, a solution that seems unlikely to make Roku very happy. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Roku for comment. Google says it’s “still working to come to an agreement with Roku to ensure continued access to YouTube TV for our mutual customers,” and it notes the YouTube TV app remains usable for those who already have it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5repmz"&gt;But in the event that things totally fall apart, Google says it’s “in discussions with other partners to secure free streaming devices in case YouTube TV members face any access issues on Roku.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eA9L6F"&gt;A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this workaround is only for consumption of YouTube TV; customers cannot sign up for new subscriptions through the YouTube app at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIHVNm"&gt;Google also said today that it’s “in ongoing, long-term conversations with Roku to certify that new devices meet our technical requirements,” yet more confirmation that the company is insisting hardware makers implement support for AV1 decoding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YFfmZc"&gt;This certification process exists to ensure a consistent and high-quality YouTube experience across different devices, including Google’s own — so you know how to navigate the app and what to expect. We’ll continue our conversations with Roku on certification, in good faith, with the goal of advocating for our mutual customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4fqUlP"&gt;Roku has argued that Google’s requirements are unreasonable and will lead to higher prices for its products. The company is sure to respond to Google’s latest move in short order, so stay tuned to see whether this feud continues to intensify.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch — and hear — NASA’s Ingenuity copter zip around on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yz-Cndas9RFA_wo85ITfLHyeDmI=/49x0:1486x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252765/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0050_0671377559_653ECM_N0031950ZCAM05020_110085J.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nAB1Z3"&gt;NASA just released video and audio of its mini Mars helicopter, Ingenuity, flying around the Martian surface during its fourth flight test, as captured by the craft’s robotic partner Perseverance from nearly a football field’s distance away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTqdr0"&gt;The footage, combining audio and video of an Ingenuity flight test for the first time, starts off with the soft, rumbling hum of the Martian wind. Ingenuity can be seen stationary on the surface in the right-hand corner of the frame before taking off for flight. When the copter ascends, the ambient hum intensifies; the faint, muffled sound of Ingenuity’s twin rotor blades spinning at 2,537 RPM picks up and it eventually zips across the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKpY41"&gt;Perseverance’s Mastcam-Z device captured the video, a sequence of hundreds of images compiled at six frames per second. That camera has returned stunning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392259/nasa-ingenuity-footage-helicopter-mars-perseverance"&gt;images and video&lt;/a&gt; of Ingenuity in the past, but those views were never synced with audio until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Listen closely  &lt;br&gt;The microphone on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAPersevere&lt;/a&gt;'s SuperCam caught sound during &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt;’s 4th flight. The rumbling is Martian wind, but those rhythmic hums come from Ingenuity. Scientists made it easier to hear by isolating the 84 Hz blade sound. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uua5h40BPL"&gt;https://t.co/uua5h40BPL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fGWlMRpVji"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fGWlMRpVji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1390684766345650182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XGXsHZ"&gt;The audio was recorded using Perseverance’s SuperCam laser instrument, a device that zaps Mars rocks with a laser beam and records the zapping sounds with an onboard microphone. While a spectrometer visually analyzes the makeup of the dust kicked up by the laser, the microphone captures audio to help scientists get an aural idea of how hard the rock is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mwfvkH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This recording will be a gold mine for our understanding of the Martian atmosphere.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q7Kkgp"&gt;That microphone worked overtime last Friday to bring us the first AV experience of Ingenuity’s fourth flight in its legendary test campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQsnNF"&gt;David Mimoun, science lead for SuperCam’s microphone, said in a statement that prior tests on Earth indicated the device would barely be able to hear Ingenuity’s flight. But hearing the gentle hum of the helicopter’s blades on Mars was “a very good surprise,” he said. “This recording will be a gold mine for our understanding of the Martian atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJyy7x"&gt;The four-pound helicopter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;arrived on Mars&lt;/a&gt; nestled inside NASA’s Perseverance rover on February 18th and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22366887/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter-drops-off"&gt;deployed&lt;/a&gt; on the surface on April 4th. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;first flight&lt;/a&gt; on April 19th made history as the first to take place on another world. Initially, engineers planned to conduct just five flight demonstration tests with Ingenuity inside a 31-day window so Perseverance — working as both a photographer and communications hub for Ingenuity — can carry on with its primary mission of hunting for signs of ancient life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oO00S6"&gt;But engineers, impressed with the helicopter’s performance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412154/nasa-ingenuity-aces-fourth-flight-mars-advance-new-testing"&gt;gave Ingenuity&lt;/a&gt; another 31-day mission to carry out a few more flights while Perseverance begins its hunt nearby. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile’s trackers will work with Amazon’s Sidewalk network starting June 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyXWdv2bRCNHn9qoFDx5jXr8Ho0=/62x0:2429x1578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252703/Screen_Shot_2021_05_07_at_11.56.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFu5HJ"&gt;Tile has announced that it’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tile-to-join-amazon-sidewalk-later-this-year-301134312.html"&gt;launching support for Amazon Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt; — the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-sidewalk-a-new-way-to-stay-connected"&gt;company’s local, Bluetooth network&lt;/a&gt; — on June 14th, allowing Amazon’s Echo devices to strengthen Tile’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmlL7w"&gt;The two companies had already announced plans for Tile to join Sidewalk last fall, but today’s announcement gives an &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/echo-tile-and-level-devices-join-amazon-sidewalk"&gt;actual date and details for the integration&lt;/a&gt;. The addition of Tile support comes just a few days after Amazon is turning on Sidewalk support for compatible Echo devices in the US on June 8th, too. Also getting access to Sidewalk are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304792/level-lock-smart-homekit-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Level’s smart locks&lt;/a&gt;, which will be able to leverage Sidewalk to directly connect to Ring doorbells, allowing the locks to be used even when outside of Bluetooth range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bwvbhe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon will launch a new location-tracking mesh network system later this year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u9KBn8"&gt;According to Amazon, Sidewalk uses a combination of “Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the 900 MHz spectrum, and other frequencies” to allow devices to communicate without Wi-Fi. Devices that support Sidewalk — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Sidewalk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21328123011"&gt;including a variety of Echo and Ring&lt;/a&gt; gadgets — can serve as “Sidewalk Bridges” that work together as access points to the Sidewalk network (think of them almost like individual points on a neighborhood-wide mesh router system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F63Sn"&gt;When Tile joins Sidewalk, its trackers will be able to be found using Amazon’s network in conjunction with Tile’s existing Bluetooth network, making it even easier to find your missing devices. Additionally, Tile is expanding support for &lt;a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005861707-Amazon-Alexa-with-Tile"&gt;Amazon’s Echo smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; by allowing users to see the Echo device to which the missing tag is closest. It’s not quite on the level of the hyper-localized tracking of an ultra-wideband network, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVMmsK"&gt;The news also comes as Apple launches its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;own AirTag trackers&lt;/a&gt;, a direct competitor to Tile’s. Apple’s trackers rely on a mixture of the company’s Find My network — which leverages the Bluetooth capabilities of iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices — and its ultra-wideband radio technology to help locate missing tracking tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdPnut"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/#:~:text=In%20a%20statement%20released%20today,a%20market%20Tile%20created%2C%20saying%3A&amp;amp;text=The%20reason%20so%20many%20people,value%20we%20offer%20our%20consumers."&gt;Tile has recently criticized Apple’s trackers&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that Apple is using its control over its hardware and software stack for unfair advantages that third-party companies (like Tile) are unable to access. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your TikTok login will soon work with other apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqjLG88FxX5PbHA1UIClJbcZtkE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252490/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oe9ohF"&gt;TikTok &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/share-sounds-and-login-with-tiktok-through-all-new-developer-kits"&gt;announced two new integrations&lt;/a&gt; for its app on Thursday: sharing audio back into TikTok using the new Sound Kit, and using your TikTok account to log in to other apps with Login Kit. Developers can apply to use the new SDKs to insert the short-form video app’s content in even more places, but they may open the company and its users to new privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00nlu6"&gt;The basic features of Login Kit will sound familiar. Facebook, Twitter, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17407334/snapchat-snapkit-ar-camera-developer-kit-login-platform"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; already offer similar integrations to speed up the logging in process. Like those other versions, TikTok says that using Login Kit will allow users to securely log in to other apps, but also let developers offer TikTok content inside those apps, like adding videos to a dating profile. Using Login with TikTok also requires you to allow whatever app you’re using to view your public profile and videos in order to work but doesn’t currently extend to the other information TikTok may know about you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ONCWPC37eoPhVQzeBEL0T3TVh2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496319/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.15.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the Login with TikTok experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6NmS6t"&gt;Logging in with another social media account is convenient, but it comes with some baggage. Facebook in particular has been criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17148726/facebook-developer-data-crackdown-cambridge-analytica"&gt;for the data that gets collected with Facebook Login&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the sources of information at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;the Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok has also been scrutinized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322612/tiktok-security-china-bytedance-spying-app-privacy"&gt;for its surveillance potential&lt;/a&gt; and a previous version of the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304228/tiktok-security-ios-clipboard-access-ios14-beta-feature"&gt;that accessed users’ clipboards&lt;/a&gt;. In regards to Login Kit, TikTok says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="DygHs5"&gt;Similar to other platforms’ SDKs, the only data TikTok can collect through Login Kit is the app’s name and associated events on our platform (i.e. event tracking for logins and authorizations). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPKDn8QP2PUwWgn955ye0MWrKww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496321/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_9.15.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sharing audio from outside apps to TikTok using Sound Kit and Login Kit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TnbfNe"&gt;One of the things that makes TikTok so compelling is all of the music it licenses for use in videos. With Sound Kit, that library of music could theoretically become even bigger, without TikTok having to strike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546323/tiktok-sony-music-licensing-deal-labels-app"&gt;new deals with the big music labels&lt;/a&gt;. Sound Kit allows developers to share audio between their apps and TikTok, so if you make a particularly great mix in one app, you can start using it in your videos. To enable audio sharing, developers will have to integrate Login Kit and the accompanying permissions into their apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O52i0L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok’s audio library could grow even larger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ocNuEr"&gt;Developers have to apply to use TikTok’s tools and SDKs and abide by the company’s guidelines, but it’s easy to imagine some potentially sketchy use cases for Sound Kit, like sharing audio without a creator’s permission or pirating music. TikTok says the sounds shared through Sound Kit are treated like any other kind of audio on the platform. Audio clips can either be private or publicly shareable, and TikTok says&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CUlOI6"&gt;When a sound is shared to TikTok, we scan it for attribution to ensure it is original audio - if it’s identified as professionally generated content we label it as such in the music detail page &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFJf5"&gt;TikTok’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok"&gt;already incredibly popular&lt;/a&gt; just by being a social media app with great video tools, but SDKs like Login Kit and Sound Kit show the app is maturing. With the new SDKs, there’s an even greater possibility TikTok’s features could become as ubiquitous as embedding a Tweet or sharing your Facebook friends list. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The chip shortage is making cars more expensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A General Motors Car Dealership Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9O1-SPHS0W_yvs7WBk9jb0aebQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252331/1232684258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RhPA4E"&gt;New cars are getting more expensive thanks to the global semiconductor shortage. And the price of used cars is going up, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAjNEc"&gt;About 13 percent of people who bought a new car in the US in April paid above sticker price, according to Jessica Caldwell, director of insights at Edmunds. Last year, only 8 percent of buyers paid more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMBU97"&gt;New vehicle prices have been on the rise for a while now, but the shortage is only worsening the trend. Automakers are &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-chip-shortage-set-to-worsen-for-car-makers-11619708393"&gt;temporarily shutting down production lines&lt;/a&gt; around the world. The chips they &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;able to source are going into the most popular new vehicles — the ones that make the most money. To make matters worse, demand for new cars and trucks is increasing, leading to markups. This has pushed more consumers to the used vehicle market, which is… driving up prices there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21Dvni"&gt;General Motors &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-first-quarter-profit-jumps-despite-chip-shortage-2021-05-05/"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; that its new full-size trucks cost 10 percent more than they did last year, and its full-size SUVs cost more than 20 percent more. Ford’s new vehicles shot up in price by $1,900 &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than the average industry increase in 2019. But overall &lt;a href="https://wardsintelligence.informa.com/WI965651/April-US-LightVehicle-Sales-Top-18-MillionPlus-Annualized-Rate-Second-Straight-Month"&gt;sales are way up&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e8RN34"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Prices are just soaring.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GO8vXv"&gt;“Prices are just soaring,” Caldwell says. “And as high as the prices go, it seems like it doesn’t really deter people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG2lne"&gt;Prices will likely keep climbing as the chip shortage keeps thinning supply. Automakers like Ford and Volkswagen have said they expect to take an even worse hit to production this quarter. Ford will only make half as many cars as it originally expected, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;said this week during its quarterly investor call&lt;/a&gt;. “We are, for sure, in crisis mode,” Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess said &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/05/06/vw-chip-shortage-profit-projection/"&gt;about the next few months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3QVBn"&gt;Some, like GM, have said they think &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-first-quarter-profit-jumps-despite-chip-shortage-2021-05-05/"&gt;lower output won’t be a huge problem&lt;/a&gt;. But the supply of new cars will further dry up for other reasons. Up until now, dealers were working with a cushion of inventory that was built up before the production halts began. The summer months are typically when seasonal demand for new cars really starts to rise, Caldwell says, and this is also no typical summer. Millions of people received stimulus checks, and vaccines for the coronavirus have finally been widely rolled out. “I imagine this year [demand] will be even higher because people are itching to go out, go places, go on road trips, go back to school,” Caldwell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URxTHV"&gt;The price of a new car was already increasing in the US as consumers flocked to larger SUVs and trucks with more advanced features, so the chip shortage has supercharged the trend. There are other contributing factors, too. Higher sticker prices became easier to swallow once automakers and banks &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/84-month-auto-loans-are-becoming-more-common-because-yo-1825414883"&gt;started offering loans&lt;/a&gt; with 84-month and 96-month terms. Those extra-long financing options got even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; palatable when automakers started offering zero-percent financing deals to boost sales early in the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqHn7s"&gt;The high demand for new cars could be tested as more automakers are starting to &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-to-strip-out-high-tech-features"&gt;sacrifice certain features due to the chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. Some Dodge Ram pickups will no longer have an intelligent rear view mirror as a standard feature, and Nissan is eschewing navigation systems in many of its vehicles. GM decided in March that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;would keep making its most popular trucks&lt;/a&gt; without a particular module that normally increases fuel economy, meaning the trucks will pollute more &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;guzzle even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hon4RI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Low supply, high demand, and it’s only going to get worse near term&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yS2sYJ"&gt;But there is already such an inventory crush, and so many people buying, that these changes might not matter much, Caldwell says. “I think [those features] can delight you and probably move you closer to a vehicle purchase, but people don’t drive different cars all the time and may not be savvy enough to know what should or shouldn’t be there,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syKdYr"&gt;With wages relatively stagnant, Cox Automotive executive analyst Michelle Krebs says she worries this will make it even harder for average buyers to get into newer, safer cars. “The average household income used to be enough to buy a new car, but it’s not anymore. It’s more like a 14 year old used car,” she says. “It’s the opposite of what Henry Ford envisioned — people who make the car can’t afford the new cars, right?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04i5g9"&gt;But used car prices are going up, too, aided in part by the chip shortage. Higher average selling prices for new cars paired with increasingly low inventory means more people are turning to the used car market, which is causing more competition between buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3P2pam"&gt;Used car prices were already on the rise for a few other reasons. Rental companies typically sell into the used car market, but they dumped much of their inventory last year as the travel industry flatlined. Now, with travel recovering as more people get vaccinated, rental companies are &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/05/04/rental-car-companies-crash-used-car-auctions-to-find-scarce-vehicles/"&gt;bidding against used car buyers&lt;/a&gt; to get some of those vehicles back, which is pushing up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cem290"&gt;Newly off-lease cars are another usual source for the used car market, but automakers have been encouraging some customers to extend their leases because of winnowing new car inventory, says Krebs. A decline in repossessions during the pandemic has also weakened the supply of used cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vayGtN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sedans actually rebounded a bit, but it won’t last&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhf43k"&gt;The chip shortage has exacerbated many of these pricing trends, but it may have temporarily reversed one that previously seemed irreversible. According to data compiled by &lt;a href="https://wardsintelligence.informa.com/WI965651/April-US-LightVehicle-Sales-Top-18-MillionPlus-Annualized-Rate-Second-Straight-Month"&gt;Ward’s Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, sedans actually picked up a few percentage points of overall market share in the US in April. Karl Brauer, executive analyst at &lt;a href="http://iSeeCars.com"&gt;iSeeCars.com&lt;/a&gt;, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; his team sees the same thing. That could mean some buyers are considering a much different middle-ground option between fighting to buy the new trucks and SUVs that are in demand and scouring the used market: settling for a smaller, more traditional new car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXzAUY"&gt;While that trend would be better for pedestrian safety and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/01/suv-conquered-america-climate-change-emissions"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; in the long run, it’s not likely to stick. US automakers have all but abandoned sedans, and even the foreign automakers who’ve been happy to fill that vacuum for the last few years are also focusing more on pickup trucks and SUVs. Long term, Krebs says, consumers are just willing to pay more for bigger, more well-equipped vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgxS7i"&gt;“The one thing they are not willing to do, they will not go from a sport utility vehicle to a car,” she says. “That is just dead on arrival.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp relaxes deadline for accepting its new privacy policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7PdduIZi0XFNZQ3SthvyFQq7iM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252305/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h10lMi"&gt;In a new statement posted on its website, WhatsApp says users won’t lose any functionality if they fail to accept its new privacy policy by May 15th. “No one will have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of WhatsApp on May 15th because of this update,” the &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/?lang=en"&gt;FAQ now reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRh0ow"&gt;That’s different from what the page originally said when it was posted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294919/whatsapp-privacy-policy-may-15th-messaging-calls-limited-functionality"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, when it warned that failing to accept the new terms by the May deadline would mean users would lose functionality. “We’ve extended the effective date to May 15th,” the page &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210220081302if_/https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;. “If you haven’t accepted by then, WhatsApp will not delete your account. However, &lt;em&gt;you won’t have full functionality of WhatsApp until you accept.&lt;/em&gt; For a short time, you’ll be able to receive calls and notifications, but won’t be able to read or send messages from the app [emphasis added].” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pC59Fi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No one will have their accounts deleted or lose functionality of WhatsApp on May 15th because of this update”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60lIBz"&gt;Although WhatsApp has relaxed the deadline for accepting the new policy, it’s still coming into force, sources with knowledge of WhatsApp’s plans confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll still be effective from May 15th for new users and for people who’ve already accepted the policy. The difference is that anyone who doesn’t accept the policy now won’t lose full functionality immediately. Instead, they’ll be shown a reminder to accept the new policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4pMK1"&gt;That’ll change after a period of several weeks when this reminder will become what WhatsApp is referring to as a “persistent reminder.” It’s at this point that the app’s functionality will become limited. Although users will still be able to answer incoming calls and respond to messages by tapping on notifications, they won’t be able to access the standard chat list from within the app. Finally, after a few additional weeks, users will lose this “limited functionality” entirely. WhatsApp says it &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-inactive-account-deletion"&gt;generally deletes inactive accounts&lt;/a&gt; after 120 days.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s explanation of what “limited functionality” will mean for users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cMW4tx"&gt;“We’ve spent the last several months providing more information about our update to users around the world,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement. “In that time, the majority of people who have received it have accepted the update and WhatsApp continues to grow. However, for those that have not yet had a chance to do so, their accounts will not be deleted or lose functionality on May 15. We’ll continue to provide reminders to those users within WhatsApp in the weeks to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teVHpT"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy has faced fierce backlash over worries that it weakens the chat service’s encryption or allows it to share more of users’ personal data with parent company Facebook. However, the policy doesn’t change the fact that personal messages between users are end-to-end encrypted, meaning only each recipient can read them. Instead, it relates to messages sent to businesses on WhatsApp. These may be stored on Facebook’s servers, and their data may be used for advertising. WhatsApp already shares some user data with Facebook, like phone numbers, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;has done so since 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKQDCm"&gt;This information hasn’t done much to calm the controversy, which resulted in rival messaging apps Telegram and Signal reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surges in new users&lt;/a&gt;. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk got involved, tweeting “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153"&gt;Use Signal&lt;/a&gt;” to his millions of followers at the beginning of January. In response to the outcry, WhatsApp said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delay the introduction of its new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; by three months from February to May. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Xbox testimony, Apple tells Microsoft to put up or shut up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GP_bGScGtXyPGqp51pUvr5KIn00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69252301/acastro_210429_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JQl1bQ"&gt;As the first week of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial comes to a close, Apple is picking a fight over one of Epic’s witnesses. The fight centers on testimony from Lori Wright, Microsoft’s vice president of Xbox business development, who testified about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;the distinction between “general purpose” and “special purpose” devices&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday in favor of Epic’s claim. Wright’s testimony set off a day of confusion over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;whether Microsoft actually makes money selling Xbox hardware&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is now asking the judge for an “adverse credibility finding,” basically a determination that Wright’s testimony can’t be trusted because of irregularities in document production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPwu96"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700170-epic-apple-strike-lori-wright-microsoft-testimony"&gt;In a new filing&lt;/a&gt;, Apple argued that some of the documents referred to in Wright’s testimony weren’t produced in advance, and the entire testimony should fall under a cloud. Apple’s lawyers zeroed in on Wright’s claim that Xbox hardware was sold at cost in order to subsidize game sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyOqrG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft really does not want to give Apple sensitive financial data about the Xbox&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gwZDZ"&gt;“Ms. Wright testified about the supposed unprofitability of Microsoft’s console business without providing the P&amp;amp;L statement from her files that could have substantiated (or disproven) her testimony,” Apple’s filing argues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KWLaI"&gt;Apple has actually made this case before, arguing back in April that Wright’s testimony should be stricken from the record because of irregular document production in the weeks leading up to the trial. Now, they’re arguing that Wright stepped outside of the preset parameters of her testimony, and her entire testimony should be deemed not credible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc4lCL"&gt;And at the center of it all is Microsoft’s profit-and-loss analysis for the Xbox hardware, which no one on the Apple side has seen. It’s worth remembering here that Apple and Microsoft have been locked in heated competition for decades now, and while Apple doesn’t have a product competing specifically against the Xbox, the broader companies are tied up in a delicate balance of fierce competition and business cooperation. As a result, Microsoft really does not want to give Apple sensitive financial data about the Xbox — and Apple sees the P&amp;amp;L statement as a way to punch back at Microsoft for getting involved in the App Store fight in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDhWoP"&gt;From the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, documents have been an issue — and it’s likely to continue being a problem as long as the proceedings go on. Both sides agreed in advance to upload exhibits to a public Box folder (&lt;a href="https://app.box.com/s/6b9wmjvr582c95uzma1136exumk6p989/folder/135953042066"&gt;it’s here&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to follow along), but the actual use of that folder has been extremely chaotic. On the first day of the proceedings, more than 100 different filings were uploaded to the general exhibits folder, only to have a handful clawed back as sealed — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;some of the Sony docs we published here&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly every day, documents have been added to the Box and then pulled back, to the point where we’ve had to mirror the whole thing just to make sure we don’t miss anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhxlRy"&gt;Some of this is normal. A big part of the legal fight is over which documents can be used in the trial and which parts of those documents can be blacked out to conceal trade secrets or other information the companies would rather not get out. The companies’ lawyers have been going back and forth on these tiny details for months; it’s just what lawyers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrNmuS"&gt;But it’s fair to say this case has been unusually chaotic — either because of the remote nature of the trial or the sheer volume of different companies involved. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of information has come out of the discovery in this case, and not all of it was supposed to. Now, Microsoft is caught between giving up information that could help in court and giving up business secrets to a longtime rival. Microsoft wants Epic to win this case, and it’s willing to talk about Xbox profitability if it helps to make that happen. But giving up that information in open court might be a bridge too far.&lt;/p&gt;
