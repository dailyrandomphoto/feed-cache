    <title>Lego’s latest Mario collaboration is a big question mark block</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIq6eesHMRHS6vNrVu2RHAc8qH0=/0x0:960x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834949/71395_LSM_2HY21_Cons_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUou5M"&gt;Lego’s latest Mario-themed set is a giant homage to &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, a giant question mark block that unfolds to reveal four levels from the Nintendo 64 game: Peach’s Castle, Bob-omb Battlefield, Cool Cool Mountain, and Lethal Lava Trouble. The “Lego Super Mario 64 ? Block set,” to use its official title, is made up of over two thousand pieces and will cost $169.99 when it goes on sale in Lego’s stores on October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGY9Co"&gt;From the trailer released today, the set looks great: four blocky dioramas of a game that itself looks pretty blocky by modern standards. But I have to split hairs and point out that, as far as I’m aware, the question mark block never actually appears in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;. Seriously, go back and look at screenshots if you don’t believe me! Those blocks have &lt;a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_64#:~:text=A%20floating,Power%20Stars."&gt;little exclamation marks on them&lt;/a&gt;, not question marks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foKq5xD4_aWWLdjQGiT5MICA72A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837008/71395_LSM_2HY21_Lifestyle_02__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block opens to reveal four levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1mNx5ZbsU07Hm5UYXhfpiIMkJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837009/71395_LSM_2HY21_Lifestyle_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego’s previous Mario figures work with the new set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eDoLnN"&gt;Along with the levels, you also get a few figurines of characters from the original game, including Princess Peach, King Bob-omb, Chain Chomp, and of course, Mario himself. If you’ve been keeping up with Lego’s previous Mario sets, then you’ll be happy to hear that your existing Lego Mario and Luigi figurines will also work with the set and will apparently unlock unique music and sounds when placed in the levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83xqtt"&gt;The announcement of the new set suggests that Lego has no intention of bringing its collaborations with Nintendo to an end. The Danish toy company released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;first Mario set last year&lt;/a&gt; and added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393486/luigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course"&gt;Luigi figurine into the mix in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571141/tanooki-mario-lego-set-power-up-pack-maker-expansion-piranha-chain-chomp"&gt;other expansion sets&lt;/a&gt;. It also produced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322481/lego-nintendo-nes-super-mario-interactive-set-replica"&gt;blocky replica of the original Nintendo Entertainment System console&lt;/a&gt; alongside a miniature retro TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEjUoH"&gt;Personally, though, I’m crossing my fingers that these sets are popular enough to get Lego to consider some sets based on Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; major franchises like The Legend of Zelda or Metroid. Plumber’s are great and all, but I’d find it pretty hard to resist having a small Lego replica of Samus Aran’s spaceship on my shelf. Maybe one day? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s first Windows 11 commercial features Master Chief blowing stuff up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BmFIHeuXC_bkW1YJb8ZD22weR-I=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834873/kjF2cQp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LCPbBY"&gt;Microsoft is debuting its first ad campaign for Windows 11 today. The 60-second TV commercial is set to “All Starts Now” by Odessa and features the new Microsoft Store, Master Chief from the world of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, Microsoft Teams, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9hUkW"&gt;Explaining what a new version of Windows will bring to consumers is never easy, and Microsoft has opted for a similar approach to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;first Xbox Series X commercial&lt;/a&gt;. An actress walks through walls of apps and selects Xbox Game Pass, which triggers Master Chief to appear and blast a &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;banshee out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOBxT2nU8TR5BMGZw2g-jkBcl8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837038/kjF2cQp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master Chief appears and blows up a Halo banshee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AiAuxM"&gt;The new bloom default wallpaper in Windows 11 also appears, alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;built-in Microsoft Teams experience&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s commercial focuses less on Windows 11 features, and more on making the OS appear... pretty. I think that’s largely the point, though. Microsoft has spent a lot of time on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;tweaking the design and visuals&lt;/a&gt; in Windows 11, with an aim of simplifying its operating system. The tagline of this commercial is “brings you closer to what you love,” presumably by removing some of the clutter that exists in Windows today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HeGb"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;launch Windows 11 on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, with new devices from partners and even its own Surface hardware. Microsoft will hold a separate Surface event on September 22nd, where we’re expecting to see a new Surface Go 3, Surface Pro 8, Surface Pro X, and a new Surface Book-like device all ready for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sega’s cashing in on old consoles by adding them to Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Monkey Ball banana blitz" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i5-3mPkrrmtP6MXygW81DXXSh5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834792/dreamcastball.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roll through mazes as an inanimate Sega console because why not?&lt;/em&gt; | Sega&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7AnVDU"&gt;September 9th marks the anniversary of the US launch of Sega’s Dreamcast, its final console before the company pivoted completely to game development and publishing in the early aughts. Sega is honoring the Dreamcast, along with the Game Gear and Saturn, in the most illogical, but hilarious way by adding them as playable characters in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l7b9vR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"It's thinking..."   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dreamcast launched in the US on 9.9.99! Now, 22 years later, the Dreamcast, Saturn, and Game Gear are rolling into the world of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania!  ️&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperMonkeyBall?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuperMonkeyBall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BananaMania?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BananaMania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dreamcast?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEGASaturn?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SEGASaturn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameGear?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GameGear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1CKNUHPdjk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1CKNUHPdjk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Super Monkey Ball (@SuperMonkeyBall) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMonkeyBall/status/1435951121135198210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0RXzGz"&gt;Sega has already announced some downloadable content for the game before its October 5th, 2021 launch date. At launch, you’ll be able to play as Kiryu from &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, as well as Beat from &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio&lt;/em&gt;, and others. These consoles-turned-characters will be available on the game’s launch day, though you’ll need to pay $4.99 to access them. After launch in November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641160/persona-5-morgana-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-dlc"&gt;Sega will launch Morgana from &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; as a character&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also cost $4.99 to unlock. Sega also announced recently that Hello Kitty will be a playable character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pH5ex"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz&lt;/em&gt; is coming to consoles for $39.99. On Steam, it’ll cost $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft gives up predicting when its US offices will fully reopen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft To Layoff 18,000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7dtDBSccChTz3Z1TOLDCPXn4wp8=/75x0:5168x3395/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834671/452292668.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stephen Brashear/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="940fVt"&gt;Microsoft is shelving its plans to fully reopen its US offices next month. The software giant had planned to reopen its headquarters on October 4th, but the ongoing uncertainty of COVID-19 and the spike in cases has forced the company to delay its back to the office push. Microsoft isn’t providing a new date to employees, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeW5jh"&gt;“Given the uncertainty of COVID-19, we’ve decided against attempting to forecast a new date for a full reopening of our US work sites in favor of opening US work sites as soon as we’re able to do so safely based on public health guidance,” explains Jared Spataro, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of modern work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTmosP"&gt;This latest delay follows a number of postponements this year to fully reopen Microsoft’s offices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344273/microsoft-redmond-headquarters-open-hybrid-workplace"&gt;A limited reopening started in March&lt;/a&gt;, with original plans to open fully by July. This got pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364001/microsoft-offices-reopen-fully-september-7th-earliest-remote-work"&gt;back to September&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607690/microsoft-proof-vaccination-covid-19-us-buildings-office-reopening"&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s now been delayed indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-JpBnGBrVL7a3kX-eZqNVbtM6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836446/Chart1_Desktop_840x572.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s latest data on hybrid work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tEHWjF"&gt;“The evolving Delta variant is compelling many of us to adjust plans for reopening worksites,” says Spataro. “It’s a stark reminder that this is the new normal. Our ability to come together will ebb and flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiVkgx"&gt;Microsoft’s delayed reopening comes as the company &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fworklab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shares more data on hybrid work&lt;/a&gt;, and its efforts to modernize Office and Microsoft Teams for this “new normal.” Microsoft-owned LinkedIn is calling this the “Great Reshuffle,” as businesses rethink cultures, company values, and how employees work daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPUR8r"&gt;According to data from LinkedIn and Glint, 87 percent of people would prefer to stay remote at least half of the time, suggesting that employers will need to adapt to the idea of hybrid work quickly. The Great Reshuffle terminology also works well to describe Microsoft’s predictions in July that “41 percent of the global workforce is likely to consider leaving their current employer within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams is getting more hybrid work improvements and Apple CarPlay support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7y_9eAfhshqtkAPmRhp2wS3gjBQ=/127x0:1468x894/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834656/Qd9KibJ.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams with Apple CarPlay support.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RuWeCQ"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to improve the remote meeting experience in Microsoft Teams with better camera support and other improvements that will let you stay in meetings 24/7, if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wm34P"&gt;After rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode last year&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447048/microsoft-teams-future-meetings-features"&gt;vision for the future of meetings&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Microsoft Teams will soon be updated to support intelligent cameras. These cameras will be supplied by partners like Jabra, Neat, Poly, and Yealink and will enable AI-powered active speaker tracking, multiple video streams, and people recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxrLwu"&gt;They’re the type of cameras that can actually deliver on some of Microsoft’s promises for the future of meetings, enabling cameras in meeting rooms to use audio, facial movements, and gestures to detect who’s in a room and speaking. These cameras are designed to improve and bridge the gap between remote and office meetings, as more and more businesses look to strike a balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9I8wnOirDMJGQaHmZFQM0VZdk6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836460/Companionmode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated companion mode for Teams mobile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="taBG5b"&gt;Microsoft Teams on mobile is also being updated to include quick access to chat, live reactions, and the Microsoft Whiteboard. This updated companion mode will also include easier access to controls like mute or camera on / off and will be available “in the next few months,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Fu13"&gt;Speaker coach, an AI-powered Teams feature that monitors your pace during meetings, is arriving in early 2022, and automatic lighting corrections for Teams video meetings will appear in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ydpi8TJL1ztLVbdxdbX3TVfS9w0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836461/cameopowerpoint.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Cameo feature in PowerPoint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UH3Ynd"&gt;Microsoft is also bringing Microsoft Teams to Apple CarPlay this month, so you can be part of Teams calls while driving. You’ll be able to join calls on the road hands-free using Siri, but it appears you’ll only join in audio mode to prevent video from creating a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xG32uu"&gt;It’s not just Teams that’s getting meeting improvements, though. Microsoft is also bringing a new Cameo feature to PowerPoint that lets you integrate a Teams camera into your presentation slide deck. Cameo will start appearing in early 2022 and is designed with remote presentations in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Y: The Last Man’s showrunner on adapting the comic: ‘It’s not a blueprint for television’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZOHer2RyHdWHu3iQGm-6JpSRP0=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834581/YTLM_101__8937R_copy.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rafy Winterfeld / FX Networks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0aFuTm"&gt;A decade ago, when Eliza Clark read &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, she kept thinking about how she would adapt it for television. “It combined so many things that I loved,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The story takes place after a mysterious event that kills off everyone with a Y chromosome, with the exception of a man named Yorrick (and his monkey). She describes it as “such an interesting look at identity.” At the time, she was working as a writer’s assistant, so it was mostly a dream. But 10 years later — after a few stops working on shows like &lt;em&gt;The Killing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rubicon&lt;/em&gt; — Clark got the chance to lead FX’s live-action version of &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt;. It was an opportunity not only to adapt a series she loved, but to update it for modern audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHG65k"&gt;“I definitely didn’t want to make something that had an essentialist view of gender,” she says. “And I think the show makes clear, early and often, that Yorrick is not the last man. That was something that I felt needed to be updated from the source material.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4oDgm"&gt;The show, which debuts next week on FX on Hulu, follows the same basic premise as the book, with much of it set after a cataclysmic event that results in every cisgender male on the planet dying. The exception is Yorrick (Ben Schnetzer), a slacker, wannabe escape artist, and son of a high-ranking US politician. The series — at least for the first six episodes I’ve been able to watch — follows a fairly large cast making their way through this newly desolate world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MO9TO4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The show is not about how men and women are different.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okSjIr"&gt;Alongside Yorrick, there’s Agent 355 (Ashley Romans), a secret agent tasked with protecting him; the newly implemented president, Jennifer Brown (Diane Lane); Sam Jordan (Elliot Fletcher), a friend who helps Yorrick’s sister Hero (Olivia Thirlby) survive a difficult journey; and Kimberly Campbell Cunningham (Amber Tamblyn) a best-selling conservative author who also happens to be the daughter of the now-deceased president; among others. In addition to a cast that’s full of women, the TV version also puts a bigger focus on trans men, including a brand-new character, played by Fletcher, who has a significant role in the first season.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PI2sDr"&gt;“I wanted to make it clear that he was not the only male,” Clark says of Yorrick’s place in the story. “I really think the show is an ensemble. I never wanted to make something that boils people down in such a specific way. The show is not about how men and women are different. It’s about people and nature and the diversity of gender. He’s important, but he’s not the main character. He’s the story engine.” She adds that one of her goals was to show that “the world is far more vast and varied and beautiful than the binary definition of man and woman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDmMtB"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://buttondown.email/charliejane/archive/everything-i-learned-from-working-on-season-one/"&gt;a blog post about working on the series&lt;/a&gt;, writer Charlie Jane Anders explained, “When you update a beloved-but-problematic story, you shouldn’t have to choose between fixing the problems and preserving the stuff you love. You can trust that expanding the picture to include everyone who has been left out will only make the story better, and that questioning the assumptions at the root of the story will lead to a smarter version. &lt;em&gt;Y: The Last Man&lt;/em&gt; is a thought experiment that asks big questions about gender and human nature — and including more variables only makes an experiment more robust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zc23UG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He’s important, but he’s not the main character. He’s the story engine.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck9UUG"&gt;Clark says she was largely given free rein over the project, and that included the blessing of original writer, Brian K. Vaughan. “Brian knew I was a fan of the book, so hopefully he felt safe in that,” she explains. “He read scripts when I asked him to, and we talked about things like casting. But he very much was like, ‘I made this when I was 25 years old, and I can’t even remember who I was then. So take this and run with it,’ which I appreciated.” When it comes to changing the material, she notes that “the comic book is a medium unto itself. It’s not a blueprint for television.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w2SLFt"&gt;Figuring out tone has been a persistent challenge for post-apocalyptic stories amid the current pandemic, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22518583/netflix-sweet-tooth-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t an exception. The first episode is very grim — it covers the event itself, which means lots of deaths — but from there, things lighten up (at least somewhat) with a mix of humor, action, and characters who are genuinely trying to do good. “I think the thing that sets this show apart is it does have an optimistic view of the power of people to change, and the power of relationships,” Clark says of her approach. “At the beginning, it’s dark because a dark thing happens and half the world dies, and I didn’t want to make light of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQBFSm"&gt;One of the more lighthearted elements of the show is Yorrick’s pet monkey Ampersand. In the show, Amp is actually a CG creation created by famed effects studio ILM, a fact Clark says she was “terrified” about. “The visual style of the show is so gritty and realistic,” she says. “You’re getting really close to people’s faces, you’re seeing skin, you’re seeing sweat. You’re close to people, and then you pan over, and there’s a cartoon monkey — I did not want that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjDMIC"&gt;For the most part, it worked. Before talking to Clark, I wasn’t actually sure if Amp was entirely a CG creation or if there was also a real animal on set. And that’s exactly how she likes it. “I want people to know how hard ILM worked on it,” she says with a laugh, “but I also don’t want people to know that he’s CG.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8Jy1w"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Y: The Last Man &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres September 13th on FX on Hulu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the PlayStation Showcase 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dqDscer3RVcQvKtJ4UhQxTSN0yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834509/acastro_200318_1777_ps5_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lZWbCM"&gt;While Microsoft has hosted plenty game showcases in 2021, Sony has been comparatively quiet about what’s coming to the PS5 in 2022. Well, Sony is going to break its relative silence with a 40-minute event that will offer “a look into the future of PS5.” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/youre-invited-playstation-showcase-2021-broadcast-next-thursday/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PlayStation Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says to expect updates from its various PlayStation Studios (the number of which seem to grow every month) on games launching this holiday and others that will release in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGpsMT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon: Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; may get some air time, since it’s a PlayStation-exclusive title that’ll be launching in the next handful of months. Of course, there’s more excitement about games we know less about. We’ve yet to see a trailer for the next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; title, so perhaps it’ll make its gameplay debut. There are a host of other possibilities, like info on &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7 &lt;/em&gt;or news on the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlQbkE"&gt;Perhaps Sony is ready to widely roll out the new PS5 firmware that will enable the M.2 SSD slot in all consoles. Personally, I wouldn’t mind seeing DLC news for exclusives that released in 2021, like &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1Km22"&gt;As for what we won’t see, Sony says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609558/sony-playstation-psvr-oled-aaa-eye-tracking-controllers"&gt;the new PSVR hardware made for PS5&lt;/a&gt; won’t be in the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UtvihO"&gt;When does the PlayStation game showcase start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pLK7Ie"&gt;The stream will kick off at 4PM ET / 1PM PT / 9PM BST on Thursday, September 9th. As previously mentioned, it’ll last for 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MkImSG"&gt;Where can I watch the PlayStation game showcase?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AjnqPS"&gt;This event will be streamed on YouTube (embedded above) and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, the Twitch stream can be a few seconds ahead, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A bunch of ape NFTs just sold for $24.4 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHIZSy8yGszg03us9T3shJpnRyM=/0x4:1816x1215/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834413/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_9.20.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U49uqm"&gt;If you thought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFT mania&lt;/a&gt; was about to die off, think again: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fape-in%2F101-bored-ape-yacht-club&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664469%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a bundle&lt;/a&gt; of 101 NFTs from Bored Ape Yacht Club just sold at Sotheby’s for $24.4 million. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fape-in%2F101-bored-ape-kennel-club&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F9%2F22664469%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second bundle&lt;/a&gt; of 101 Bored Ape Kennel Club NFTs sold for $1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAsJw1"&gt;That puts the ape sale among the biggest in the NFT space. A bundle of nine CryptoPunks — one of the earliest NFT projects — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430254/cryptopunks-christies-sale-larva-labs"&gt;sold for $16.9 million&lt;/a&gt; in May. And Beeple sold a collage of his works as an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March. While it’s hard to directly compare all of these sales (there are 101 items in today’s auctions versus one in Beeple’s), the purchases show that the appetite for NFT art isn’t dying down, and they suggest that buyers think there’ll be high resale value as the market continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9m2q5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Who’ll make the next million-dollar NFT?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lAyRlm"&gt;The two sales at Sotheby’s today come from Yuga Labs, the creator of Bored Ape Yacht Club, or BAYC, which launched in April. The initial collection &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"&gt;contained 10,000 apes, semi-randomly generated&lt;/a&gt; in unique arrangements of sailor hats, eye patches, bone necklaces, stud earrings, and other accessories to dress them up. Ape owners get to be members of the titular club, which is supposed to provide various benefits (so far, that’s mostly been access to exclusive merch drops, bonus NFTs, and use of an online graffiti board). Bored Ape Kennel Club is a series of accompanying dog NFTs that were later sent out to ape owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiApvG"&gt;Generative NFT collections like this have taken off in recent months, with all kinds of copycats and twists launching to take advantage of the hype. After its debut, BAYC quickly become the second-biggest name in NFT collections, right behind CryptoPunks. The cheapest ape now sells for around $149,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2l51Xt"&gt;Meanwhile, centuries-old auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s have seen the (literal) value in promoting this new format for art and have hosted a number of sales for high-profile NFTs. An auction at Christie’s will feature BAYC &lt;a href="https://www.christies.com/en/auction/no-time-like-present-20909-hgk/"&gt;later this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s latest Dolby Atmos soundbar has a much more sensible price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fZG_hmBPYvz04Xa5o0chFyIDJk0=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834348/01.Hero_Shot_Mid.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7g5Vyd"&gt;I recently reviewed Sony’s flagship 2021 Dolby Atmos soundbar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623242/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-xbox-series-x-ps5"&gt;the HT-A7000&lt;/a&gt;, and found it to be a fantastic performer made even better by two passthrough inputs that offer support for HDMI 2.1 features like 4K gaming at 120Hz. But with a price of $1,300 (and that’s before adding rear surrounds and a sub), Sony’s latest and greatest isn’t going to be practical for everyone. So with that in mind, the company is today announcing a cheaper, smaller model called the HT-A5000 that costs $899.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="le8NMA"&gt;That price puts it somewhat closer in line with something like the Sonos Arc, but Sony’s new soundbar could win people over for its added functionality and future-proofing. The HT-A5000 retains much of what’s good about the higher-end model: it’s still an Atmos bar with up-firing speakers — albeit fewer drivers overall. This is a 5.1.2 configuration compared to the 7.1.2 HT-A7000. But you still get built-in support for Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, and Bluetooth audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxYOkMDopZNyFjuRcXJY49DE2g4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836564/04_A5000_CloseUp_Mid.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HT-A7000 might have a premium glass surface, but I think you could argue that the HT-A5000 looks better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GRUD5H"&gt;At 10 pounds (compared to the hulking 26 pounds of the HT-A7000), the HT-A5000 also measures significantly smaller than the more expensive model. It’ll certainly look more at home next to a 55-inch TV like mine than the very long HT-A7000 did. But with those smaller dimensions, you can expect weaker sound performance than the flagship. The larger, heavier enclosure of the HT-A7000 prevents unwanted vibrations and helps maintain cleaner sound at loud volume levels. It also allowed Sony to have two tweeters facing the left and right sides, which isn’t the case on the HT-A5000.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o5PaP9S5f-c5O50FZjFLdA5FZyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836652/10_A5000_skelton_Mid__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HT-A5000 is a 5.1.2 Atmos soundbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sGbSRv"&gt;One key difference is that instead of including two HDMI 2.1 passthroughs, Sony sticks with just one on the HT-A5000. It’ll still send through 8K video, 4K at 120Hz, and Dolby Vision. But unfortunately, like its pricier sibling, this soundbar doesn’t currently support variable refresh rate (VRR) or auto low latency mode (ALLM). Sony is looking into both of these features but isn’t promising anything at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIVdDS"&gt;Like the flagship, the HT-A5000 has acoustic optimization to automatically produce the best sound for whatever room you put it in. Sony’s technologies like Vertical Surround Engine and S-Force Pro are also present for convincing height effects and a wide, immersive surround experience. It supports the same optional rear surrounds ($349.99) and two subwoofer choices as the HT-A7000. Those will obviously drive the cost up, but at least you’re starting off spending $400 less. The HT-A5000 is expected to ship in early fall. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing emoji reactions for tweets </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0zIqnl6Zpy9RuWLPyWDtlKpEjK4=/0x24:2048x1389/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834271/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fVELIi"&gt;Twitter is testing emoji reactions for tweets that go beyond a simple “Like,” the company announced today. So, over the coming days, users in Turkey will be able to respond to tweets with the “Face with tears of joy” emoji, “Thinking face,” “Clapping hands,” “Crying face,” or a simple “Heart.” The test is only scheduled to run for a limited time, but Twitter says it might expand it to users in more countries depending on the response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATsNw1"&gt;The idea behind the feature is to give people more ways to quickly show how they feel about a tweet, Twitter says, while providing authors better feedback about how their tweet has been received. The emoji are accessible via a long-press of the Like button, while a short tap will send a regular Like. Rumors of the test &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348952/twitter-emoji-reactions-downvotes-tweets-testing-features"&gt;emerged earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; after users reported being surveyed about potential emoji for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgsBqEL5MnIyUNdd9sN8NU_zOkE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836417/Untitled__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reactions will appear below tweets in Twitter’s feed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9BJ32"&gt;Emoji reactions have been available for years on other services like Facebook, as well as on Twitter itself within direct messages. But what’s interesting about Twitter’s emoji choices for its latest test is that none of them are especially negative. There’s no “Angry face” like you’ll find on Facebook, or “Thumbs down” like in Twitter’s direct message emoji reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeB4BT"&gt;Twitter explains that it decided against choosing these negative emoji because people it surveyed said “they were concerned about receiving negative reactions to some of their thoughts.” A valid concern given how toxic many conversations on Twitter can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q46bGj"&gt;Meanwhile, the emoji it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; included earned their spots by being representative of the most common emotions people experience while reading tweets, as well as being “universally recognizable.” That probably explains why the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/11/dont-put-on-a-happy-face-are-you-using-the-smiley-emoji-all-wrong"&gt;incredibly passive aggressive&lt;/a&gt; “Slightly smiling face” emoji didn’t make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jrs6jR"&gt;If you’re in Turkey and want to give the new reactions a go, Twitter says the feature is rolling out over the coming days in the country. The test will be available on iOS, Android, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
