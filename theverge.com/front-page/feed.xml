    <title>The Galaxy A32 5G debuts in Europe as Samsung’s cheapest 5G phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOHF6diQ4OW-ysNMLO9C9TyzM2E=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669855/02_galaxya32_5g_2p_lg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A32 5G offers a 6.5-inch display and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kVfz2V"&gt;Echoing a theme that will be repeated a lot more this year, Samsung has announced a very inexpensive 5G phone. The Galaxy A32 5G is debuting in Europe first, starting at €279 for a 64GB version or €299 for 128GB. There’s no official word yet on whether it will come to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipULvU"&gt;The A32 5G offers a 6.5-inch 1600 x 900 display, a 5,000mAh battery, and a side-mounted fingerprint reader. Its rear camera array includes a 48-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera, and the obligatory 5-megapixel macro camera. Around front, it offers a 13-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9Wn8B"&gt;Samsung doesn’t say what processor the phone is using, only that it’s a 2.0GHz octa-core chipset, but &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/14/the-galaxy-a32-launches-as-samsungs-cheapest-5g-phone-to-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; suspects&lt;/a&gt; it’s a Dimensity 720. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230868/samsung-galaxy-s21-storage-microsd-support-slot"&gt;unlike the flagship phones&lt;/a&gt; debuting today, the A32 5G will offer a microSD card slot for storage expansion. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/de/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-neuer-mittelklasse-star-ab-mitte-februar-verfugbar"&gt;Samsung Germany says&lt;/a&gt; the phone will be available starting on February 12th. Color options include (get ready for it) “awesome black,” “awesome white,” “awesome blue,” and “awesome violet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oA3gbj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10284547"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmh8bS"&gt;2021 should see no shortage of affordable 5G phones. We’ve already reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, which just came to the US for $299. The arrival of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 480 5G chip&lt;/a&gt; also paves the way for even cheaper, sub-$200 devices. We’d still like to remind you that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;5G alone isn’t a good reason&lt;/a&gt; to buy a new phone, but it’s getting more and more likely that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; new phone you consider this year will offer 5G, regardless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9Hv0Vo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199532/bmw-subscription-service-nashville"&gt;Access by BMW was launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt; in Nashville as a pilot project to test out whether customers would want to have access to a fleet of fancy cars but not necessarily own one. But recent requests to sign up have been met with a disclaimer that the service is in the process of shutting down. A Nashville resident who was interested in applying for the subscription service was told that it was going to be defunct by the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbekUO"&gt;“Unfortunately the Access by BMW subscription program is ending on January 31st and we are no longer taking new members,” a sales representative said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T3g9yw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Unfortunately the Access by BMW subscription program is ending on January 31st”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zUt5H1"&gt;A BMW spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that BMW was winding down its pilot, though the company appears to be leaving the door open for future experiments. “The Access by BMW vehicle subscription program was launched in Nashville, TN in April of 2018 and was always intended to be a pilot program,” the spokesperson said. “As such, the pilot will conclude at the end of this month. We are in the process of developing the next iteration of Access by BMW and will share more information with you as it becomes available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XsDZNq"&gt;The spokesperson declined to share sales numbers but acknowledged that “the program had reached its capacity limits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dz8Wd1"&gt;Despite the imminent shutdown, the &lt;a href="https://www.accessbybmw.com/"&gt;Access by BMW&lt;/a&gt; website is still up and running, with a link on the automaker’s North American site redirecting to it. “A new way of driving BMW is coming,” the homepage promises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKBA3c"&gt;Access by BMW consisted of two tiers. For $2,000 a month, members could choose between models like the X5 SUV, 4 Series, and 5 Series sedans, including all plug-in hybrid versions. For the higher-tier $3,700-a-month fee, they could get M4, M5, or M6 convertibles as well as X5M and X6M SUVs. (BMW’s highest-end 7 Series was not available through the service). The fee included insurance, maintenance, and roadside assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPMyuX"&gt;If that seems a bit pricey, you’re not wrong. The top-tier $3,700-a-month plan is almost three times the cost of leasing an M5 sedan in the Nashville area (though a lease requires a down payment of $5,724 and doesn’t include insurance and maintenance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkaLPE"&gt;Subscriptions have been a mixed bag for the auto industry. Ford walked away from its service last fall following low demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18050020/cadillacs-car-subscription-service-shutting-down"&gt;Cadillac shut down its service Book in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197772/cadillac-book-2-subscription-service-dealers"&gt;resurrect it&lt;/a&gt; several months later with fewer options. Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306823/mercedes-benz-collection-subscription-service-cancel-sales"&gt;Mercedes-Benz pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; its Collection subscription service, citing mediocre sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2i7XI"&gt;Other automakers have had some success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/10/16455246/porsche-car-subscription-service-launch"&gt;Porsche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17888304/audi-subscription-service-monthly-fee-dallas"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16720830/volvo-suv-subscription-plan-600-la-auto-show-2017"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143852/nissan-switch-subscription-service-price-model-vehicle"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17464548/jaguar-land-rover-car-subscription-service-carpe-uk"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; are still offering some variation of a subscription service. Even the big car rental companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18652907/hertz-my-car-subscription-rental-terms-enterprise"&gt;Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514404/enterprise-car-subscription-service-rental"&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, are getting in on the action. Most of these subscriptions are only available in specific cities and are still in the pilot phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBPmbN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel updates its NUC lineup, including a follow-up to its Hades Canyon gaming mini-PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OP-_BBVk9EPGVBF752nz1r9koc=/177x101:1322x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669762/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_12.02.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WiyJNU"&gt;Intel is updating its Next Unit of Computing (NUC) lineup of miniature computers with its 11th Gen processors, and it’s again including a gaming-focused model. The NUC 11 Enthusiast is a follow-up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17346234/intel-nuc-8-pc-gaming-amd-vega-review"&gt;the NUC 8 Hades Canyon from 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which managed to pack triple-A gaming performance (not to mention I/O that rivaled a full-size desktop) into a tiny enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1a9Xf"&gt;Included in the refresh are updates to the company’s more traditional small-cube NUC Performance Mini computers, which previously had 10th Gen processors. The upgrade brings Wi-Fi 6 and Intel Xe graphics to the i5 and i7 models. Intel has also added a NUC Pro line, some of which have vPro-enabled CPUs and all of which can drive 8K displays. There’s also a NUC 11 compute unit, which is just a board meant to be integrated into future computers. This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234333/intel-nuc-9-extreme-mini-pc-ghost-canyon-gaming-review-price-specs-features"&gt;isn’t the first time Intel has had that idea&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll get more into that in just a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2tNrPQKpoliFytopIFkFhamCb18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236260/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_12.58.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NUC 11 Pro computers come in many sizes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nY16m9"&gt;NUCs, however, are notable because of their size, and while the Performance and Pro lines are indeed very small, they’re more minor updates to what we already had before. What’s more interesting is the gaming version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k9yLsiR8jSHfsrm4aFK6qNSB56E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236040/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_11.47.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NkvVx1"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/boards-kits/nuc/nuc-11-enthusiast-mini-pc-kit-brief.html"&gt;NUC 11 Enthusiast&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed “Phantom Canyon,” promises gaming performance with a 28W quad-core i7-1165G7 (the same found in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;the 2020 Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;) and an RTX 2060, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;which was made outdated the day before Intel’s announcement of the computer&lt;/a&gt;. It also keeps the stacked I/O that made the last generation great, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2.5Gb Ethernet, a whopping six USB 3.2 Type-A ports, and Wi-Fi 6. The lack of HDMI 2.1 (it only has 2.0b) can be somewhat forgiven due to the inclusion of a Mini DisplayPort 1.4 output. And again, all of this is fitting inside an enclosure that’s roughly the size of a hefty book.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YFqgc9OFBMNBGcZH6RkHBtTQR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236257/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_11.44.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports, beautiful ports. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Djl89X"&gt;Like the other NUC models, the Enthusiast also has Xe integrated graphics, which should be good for streamers or creative professionals that enjoy Intel’s Quick Sync video encoding technology. While it’s a shame about the almost-up-to-date graphics card, the computer should still provide a good amount of gaming performance in an absolutely diminutive package, and I’m glad to see Intel’s still working on mini gaming PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Awgcuk"&gt;Intel has a long history of trying to make the NUC into a miniature gaming PC with full-sized performance. It even teamed up with AMD to put dedicated Vega graphics into the NUC 8, which was clearly hoping to appeal to gamers more than office workers, with a glowing skull logo emblazoned on the top. Then, at CES 2020, it showed off the NUC 9 Extreme, which aimed to be a gaming PC with an easy-to-upgrade compute unit. Except Intel, so far, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225459/best-tech-ces-2020-where-are-they-now-what-happened-next"&gt;hasn’t released any updates for the compute units&lt;/a&gt;, so at the moment, it’s just an expensive and modular-for-no-reason gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvwCnW"&gt;Intel hasn’t released pricing and availability yet, &lt;a href="https://simplynuc.com/phantom-canyon/"&gt;but SimplyNUC.com has the Phantom Canyon starting at $1,349&lt;/a&gt;. That looks to be a better deal than the NUC 9 Extreme, which is $1,599 on the same site and also requires a separate mini graphics card. It also beats its more direct predecessor, the NUC 8 Hades Canyon, which is still $1,234 for nearly two-year-old hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn4PZQ"&gt;Intel appears to be using the same strategy it’s used for the NUC computers in the past, where people can buy either a complete computer or a kit where they’ll be required to provide the RAM, storage drive, and OS. SimplyNUC’s $1,349 model has the drive and RAM, but you will have to pay extra for or bring your own copy of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision can be weird because Marvel has already won</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWrbDwsNbBbkVZEGOReRoU8DR_k=/260x0:3062x1868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669590/wcb1160_102_comp_v340_20201119_r709_c8d55508.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gtLqPZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; is the Marvel universe’s most comic book show yet, if not in content at least in concept. It’s a dense-looking storyline that will be released on an episodic basis, with characters and a setting that are virtually impenetrable to new viewers — so much so that Marvel Studios even went so far as to produce a clip show recapping the critical moments of the 23-odd films that precede it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lK2aoC"&gt;It may seem like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; would be barreling toward the same issue that has hounded traditional comics for years — a high barrier to entry with complex storylines, character dynamics, and lore that span decades and serve to confuse and drive away new readers — but &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; arguably doesn’t have that same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g625zS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"As WandaVision arrives, Marvel Studios is about to enter a never-ending cycle ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iyQbOq"&gt;Pick up a random issue of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, and you’ll likely be confused by the contents, unless you’ve found a particularly accessible entry ramp like a creative reboot (for example, Jonathan Hickman’s recent run of the X-Men books) or a self-contained crossover. Comic sales are doing just fine, but the industry itself is a drop in the bucket compared to the massive pop culture impact of the Marvel blockbusters. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/7/26/8893276/best-selling-comic-book-of-all-time-x-men-1-marvel-dc"&gt;Even the bestselling books of all time&lt;/a&gt; can’t come close in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muZoJW6xTftKTvHOPC7uDONNbec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22236249/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_3.55.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YFmGPG"&gt;The fact that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; isn’t particularly accessible to new viewers isn’t a mark against it: it’s a spinoff of what’s arguably the single most popular film franchise ever made and a direct follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, the biggest movie in history. Comic book movies and shows are no longer tiny underdogs trying to lure in new viewers who aren’t the traditional comic audience — they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; popular culture now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIpmT7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have to cater to a new audience; it’s free to get as weird as it wants for the unprecedentedly large audience it already has, an audience that Disney is hoping will sign up for monthly Disney Plus subscriptions to watch it. (The same goes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;all of the other Marvel shows heading to the service&lt;/a&gt;.) After all, why sell customers a $15 movie ticket to a giant blockbuster only once when you can get them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;subscribe to your streaming service for $8 per month forever&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF44Wd"&gt;In fact, Disney Plus’ very existence incentivizes Disney to make &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; more obtuse to new viewers. After all, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the Marvel movies that you’d need to understand &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; are already on the streaming service. If someone opens up &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; on Friday and decides to shelve it while they work their way through the rest of the MCU on Disney Plus, then Disney wins just as much as it would have had they watched &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; itself. Even &lt;em&gt;Marvel Legends&lt;/em&gt; — the recap show — requires a Disney Plus subscription to view, and it ends each episode with a list of movies (also streaming on Disney Plus) people should watch to better understand &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Mandalorian" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hXqYl34ddUAuviiRRga7ntDuKrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22162694/HUC2_FF_003556.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zAm0WF"&gt;It’s a strategy that we’ve already seen Disney use to great effect with &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season tied in heavily to past &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows like &lt;em&gt;The Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rebels&lt;/em&gt;. For fans who were up to speed on the older shows, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; was delivering payoffs that were years in the making. For fans who weren’t, they suddenly had a great reason to keep those subscriptions going after the season finale to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZUSvZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; is by all accounts one of the strangest Marvel entries yet. It’s not the show the studio was hoping to use to kick off its TV efforts. (That title goes to the delayed — and more mainstream — &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, which will follow in March.) It doesn’t need to cater to new fans because of the sheer momentum of the Marvel machine, even though the first few episodes also demonstrate that it’s weird enough — and detached enough — from the main films that people can still come to it as its own thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgnql0"&gt;But Marvel’s entertainment juggernaut is so big and consistent that it doesn’t really matter which show kicks off Disney Plus. The company has already won over viewers. All &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; needs to do is give them a reason to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung put the final nail in the box that used to contain a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoxmcD2AIsSFESRPut1p0AUBcA4=/313x0:2188x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669245/samsung_mocking_apple_no_charger_iphone_12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Samsung used to advertise, but not anymore.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Samsung (via 9to5Google)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGuKmN"&gt;There was a time I would have railed against a gadget maker for daring to ship a phone without a charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n75bX1"&gt;That time was yesterday. Then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple was the poster boy for the idea&lt;/a&gt; — Apple with its goody-two-shoes rhetoric about saving the environment while continuing to produce an array of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"&gt;proprietary cables&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21441290/apple-watch-qi-wireless-charging-standard-environment-cable-proprietary-standard"&gt;wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt;, one of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169285/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible"&gt;requires you to buy a new power brick&lt;/a&gt; anyhow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LL5ra2"&gt;Samsung doesn’t have those problems. It’s been all-in on USB-C and the Qi wireless standard for years, and you can use &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;such cable and &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; charger from any reputable manufacturer to top up your Samsung phone. Heck, those same universal cables and chargers work with laptops and tablets, too: you can use a MacBook or iPad charger to juice up a new Samsung phone, as long as it’s recent enough to use the universal port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NT3lox"&gt;Even if you do want a new charger, you might not buy it from Samsung these days; while it’s nice that it dropped the price of its standalone USB-C charger from $35 to $20 to mark this occasion, companies like Anker and HyperJuice / Sanho produce tiny yet potent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051974/gallium-nitride-anker-material-silicon-semiconductor-energy"&gt;gallium nitride (GaN)&lt;/a&gt; chargers you can toss into any bag, not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21311978/hyper-hyperjuice-charger-available-price-kickstarter-specs"&gt;playing card-deck sized ones&lt;/a&gt; with enough power and ports to charge a laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Left: old and busted. Right: new hotness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EYq1qk"&gt;I bought a couple of those, and I’m good on chargers for the foreseeable future. For now, most any power brick that comes with a gadget is just a piece of waste, something I’ll need to recycle or attempt to pawn off on a friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NborX"&gt;It wasn’t always this way. I remember being grateful for the Samsung chargers that came bundled with my Galaxy S6 and S7 because they were the best on the market — remember these tapered right-angle wall warts that stuck out so ridiculously far? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiH7EwFqX4dpi4MPdG6CPQv_Jqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235824/samsung_right_angle_adaptive.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8v64Gv"&gt;They also happened to be powerful adaptive fast chargers that worked perfectly for lots of devices, whether they needed fast charging or not. Motorola’s TurboPower charger was also pretty good as I recall, but it only came with the company’s most expensive phones, and the early USB-C versions had a fixed (not detachable) cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWWMrn"&gt;There are still some arguments why smartphone companies should keep bundling power bricks with their new devices, like how there will always be some people who’ve never owned a phone before and won’t have a charger. Many will also point out that these companies are doing it for selfish reasons — still charging you the same amount or more for a phone while giving you less value in the box. (It’s fun to rag on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;these companies’ duplicity&lt;/a&gt;, too.) But like my colleague Dieter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;said succinctly last June&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t care: let’s get rid of 300,000 tons of e-waste and help the world’s remaining brand-new USB-C smartphone buyers get their chargers elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coYaCa"&gt;With Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/26/22200610/xiaomi-ceo-phone-no-charger-mocking-apple-iphone"&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple all ditching the charger, it’s effectively over regardless of how you feel. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541408/smartphone-market-share-q3-2020-samsung-apple-huawei-xiaomi"&gt;By market share&lt;/a&gt;, they’re the number 1, 3, and 4 brands, respectively, accounting for nearly half of all smartphone shipments in the world, and in the United States, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629003/us-phone-upgrades-apple-samsung-market"&gt;a Samsung and Apple duopoly for years&lt;/a&gt;. But more importantly, the smartphone world has long gone where Apple and Samsung lead. The bundled phone power brick is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV9UDa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle are working on digital vaccination records</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WnDcCZ345mAiafgtG5tqUtfspkA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669139/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AudqVK"&gt;A coalition of health and tech companies, which includes Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle, is working on an initiative that aims to make it easier for people to access their COVID-19 vaccination records digitally. As people are beginning to get vaccinated against COVID-19, they may need to prove that they’re vaccinated so that they can return to work, school, or to travel, and having an easily accessible digital vaccination record could help with that. The coalition is calling itself the &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinationcredential.org/"&gt;Vaccination Credential Initiative (VCI)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEhoY6"&gt;“VCI’s vision is to empower individuals to obtain an encrypted digital copy of their immunization credentials to store in a digital wallet of their choice,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210114005294/en/Broad-Coalition-of-Health-and-Technology-Industry-Leaders-Announce-Vaccination-Credential-Initiative-to-Accelerate-Digital-Access-to-COVID-19-Vaccination-Records"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t want to use a smartphone, you could receive papers with QR codes containing similarly verifiable credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fah8U2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VCI is working to make the credentials using open and interoperable technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3PnxSs"&gt;VCI says it is working to make the credentials using the &lt;a href="https://healthwallet.cards/"&gt;SMART Health Cards specification&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to let people store immunization or lab results in a digital wallet. (More information about the specification is also available &lt;a href="https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/health-cards"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcXAFn"&gt;But VCI’s press release doesn’t provide a timeline as to when organizations administering COVID-19 vaccines will be able to make these records, so it’s unclear when you’ll be able to actually add one to a digital wallet. And with people in the US &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/health/covid-19-vaccination-kit-record-card/index.html"&gt;already receiving paper cards&lt;/a&gt; recording when they get their COVID-19 vaccines, it’s unclear how those records would transfer to VCI’s digital standard, if they can at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OF1nvF"&gt;Another hurdle could be getting health centers to participate, as some providers may have more resources to incorporate these credentials into the vaccination process than others would. And there are also &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-passports-could-help-life-return-to-normal-but-experts-urge-caution-11607425135"&gt;ethical questions&lt;/a&gt; about whether a person who can prove they are vaccinated should have more freedoms than someone who is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atMonz"&gt;VCI isn’t the first coalition to consider a digital COVID-19 vaccination record. Similar efforts are modeling themselves on existing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/yellow-card-vaccine-passport/2020/12/30/746c0558-40b7-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html"&gt;vaccine documents&lt;/a&gt; already required by some countries for entry. (These document vaccinations for diseases like yellow fever or polio.) One effort, by Estonia and the World Health Organization, began developing a digital COVID-19 vaccine certificate &lt;a href="https://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/estonia/news/news/2020/10/estonia-and-who-to-work-together-on-digital-health-and-innovation"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATVzgh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVbRDy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 doesn’t support Samsung Pay’s most convenient feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8fInbBkh7rTQvF1eJKfLxl7v_zE=/0x45:1067x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68669092/SamsungPayMST.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hW6Fdv"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; no longer support the convenient Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) feature of Samsung Pay. And based on &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/14/samsung-pay-is-losing-its-one-remaining-good-feature-on-the-galaxy-s21/"&gt;what the company told &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the same will be true for all phones that Samsung releases from here on out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa4LC1"&gt;If you’re not familiar, &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/what-is/mst/#:~:text=Magnetic%20Secure%20Transmission%2C%20or%20MST,that%20helps%20power%20Samsung%20Pay.&amp;amp;text=Accepted%20at%20nearly%20all%20payment,Pay%20also%20supports%20NFC%20payments." rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MST is a very cool trick&lt;/a&gt; that allows Samsung phones to send out a magnetic pulse that made payment terminals think that you’d swiped a regular credit card. The most beneficial thing about it is that MST can work in scenarios where NFC payments aren’t available. It can send that magnetic signal to pretty much any payment terminal with a traditional card swiper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YI6mpl"&gt;MST is by no means perfect: getting a payment to go through on the first try can sometimes be a challenge, and it’s worthless in situations where you have to stick your card all the way into a slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTAnqH"&gt;But now it’s a goner, with Samsung believing that NFC adoption has reached a point where it can phase out the MST aspect of Samsung Pay. “Due to the rapid adoption of near field communication (NFC) technology by consumers and businesses, beginning with devices launched in 2021, Samsung Pay will focus its support on NFC transactions, across the Galaxy portfolio,” Samsung said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Android Police.&lt;/em&gt; “While future devices will no longer include magnetic stripe technology (MST), customers with previous, compatible Galaxy devices will be able to continue using Samsung Pay, including MST.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jR2kM"&gt;Samsung phones as recent as the Galaxy S20 FE still had MST capabilities built in, so you don’t have to go far back to find a compatible device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l67Tqb"&gt;This means with the Galaxy S21 family, Samsung has now gotten rid of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W98UH5"&gt;The charging brick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jfuZL1"&gt;microSD storage expansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vZrE0Z"&gt;MST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="3u7I9D"&gt;I get the sense that a lot of people won’t mind losing some (or all) of those things — especially with the lower starting prices on the S21 and S21 Plus — but there’s no denying that Samsung Pay just lost what was maybe its best standout trick. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>QHD screens might be the best thing to happen to gaming laptops in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade Pro 17" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6YOmYo3ri00-TllPvytBfgjU9U=/0x0:1028x685/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668957/blade17pro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CPtUfp"&gt;One of the biggest announcements at CES 2021 seemed to come and go without much fanfare. Overshadowed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;Nvidia’s debut of its RTX 3000-series graphics chips&lt;/a&gt; for laptops, you might have missed hearing that a growing number of manufacturers are &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;building fast-refreshing QHD screens into their portable gaming machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhWj1D"&gt;Standalone QHD (1440p) monitors are a popular choice for discerning gamers who use desktop computers for several reasons. First, the displays are often more affordable and feature-packed than most 4K monitors while looking nearly as good. And importantly, modern high-end graphics cards, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; (and even some last-gen products), run games &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;well at QHD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs2CaM"&gt;Frustratingly and inexplicably, though, QHD hasn’t been an option if you want one built into your gaming laptop. You’ve had a choice of either 1080p or 4K or the option to output to a 1440p monitor that you purchase separately. That’s changing for 2021, and perhaps at the perfect time, as machines powered by RTX 3000-series and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227144/amd-rdna-2-gpu-gaming-laptops-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;AMD’s incoming RDNA 2&lt;/a&gt; graphics chips will take full advantage of QHD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Adsbv9PNMSXX0CVgZgU9SftO34U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227494/nitro52021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 has the option for a QHD display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xd5Q0"&gt;I’m still of the opinion that 1080p looks &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; for most use cases, but I won’t argue that displaying games in 1080p with relatively smooth performance is a low hurdle for even midrange laptop hardware to clear. On the other hand, playing the latest AAA games at 4K resolution with all of the graphical settings set to max is at once impressive and mediocre, with frame rates frequently dipping into the unplayable zone. QHD screens in powerful laptops can offer great visual fidelity with hardware that should have no issue keeping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bntovv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15&lt;/a&gt; is one of a few laptops announced at CES 2021 that will let you add a QHD screen to your order, and I was pleased to see that doing so won’t add all that much to the grand total. For $2,199 ($200 more than the model that features an FHD 144Hz panel), you get a machine with a QHD IPS screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, along with the new Nvidia RTX 3070 and a six-core 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor. This price is on par with many current laptops equipped with last-gen parts and a fast-refreshing 1080p screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BmfoZ"&gt;In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised to see gaming laptops with QHD screens falling below the sub-$2K price point this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218681/acer-nitro-5-gaming-laptop-intel-11th-tiger-lake-h35-amd-ryzen-rtx-3080-qhd-release-date-price"&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 for 2021&lt;/a&gt; will also have the option to be configured with a QHD screen, and I’m sure many other OEMs will follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqRZix7GLWbgFdUlExq2wccjjDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227284/blade15hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SXe78T"&gt;I’m not yet able to tell you what kind of performance Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series delivers on new laptops until later in the month. But if you’re used to gaming on a 1080p monitor, seeing it all running on a more pixel-dense QHD screen could be revelatory. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart will give shoppers $25 when they take time off to get the coronavirus vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instacart" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3LSRsQ0lRZMbk9uLosBwlHwUaes=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668708/1084202690.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zvm8GN"&gt;Instacart will give its shoppers — the workers who pick and fill grocery store orders for customers — a $25 stipend for the time they take off to get a coronavirus vaccine, the company announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMIaS8"&gt;Beginning February 1st, any full-service Instacart shopper in North America who has shopped at least five batches — which can include one or more customer orders — in the past 30 days and can also verify they have received a vaccine will be eligible. Shift leads and in-store shoppers who are actively employed when they receive the vaccine will be eligible as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJzHnJ"&gt;The company says the $25 is intended to provide shoppers with financial assistance as they take time away from shopping. &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/instacart-shopper-make-money"&gt;Full-service shoppers&lt;/a&gt; are independent contractors who both pick and deliver groceries, while in-store shoppers are part-time Instacart employees who do in-store shopping only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5ObeiU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company wants its workers to receive priority vaccine access&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AAtfvj"&gt;Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta said in a statement the company is taking “proactive steps to advocate that government agencies recognize Instacart shoppers as critical essential workers who deserve early access to vaccines.” It’s joined by other gig economy companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167583/uber-driver-early-access-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;, DoorDash, and Lyft that &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/instacart-vaccine-workers-gig-companies-335d1695-d903-40af-b09e-c6d1426832d0.html"&gt;have lobbied for their independent contractors&lt;/a&gt; to receive priority vaccine access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1t2tyi"&gt;Instacart, which does not provide medical benefits for its independent contractor shoppers, has unveiled several initiatives to demonstrate it is attempting to protect its workers from becoming infected with COVID-19, but with mixed results. Under an agreement with the attorney general for Washington, DC in June, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21278359/instacart-sick-pay-gig-workers-dc-ag-telemedicine-childcare"&gt;expanded its sick pay benefit&lt;/a&gt; to anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 by a health care provider, even without a positive test, and provided a telemedicine option through Doctor on Demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Suh0Ph"&gt;Instacart also said it would provide sick pay to shoppers who live with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. However, shoppers have reported that the application &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"&gt;process to receive sick pay has been difficult to navigate&lt;/a&gt; and the benefit was not always approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JCWVU"&gt;In March 2020, the company announced its plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/29/21198986/instacart-hand-sanitizer-shoppers-strike-coronavirus"&gt;distribute health and safety kits&lt;/a&gt; to its shoppers, which include a washable face mask and hand sanitizer. It says it’s delivered more than 620,000 of the kits to shoppers via its app and website, but again, shoppers have described a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/18/21226481/instacart-shoppers-safety-kits-coronavirus-masks"&gt;complicated process for receiving the kits&lt;/a&gt;. The kits were announced just as a group of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@GigWorkersCollective/instacart-emergency-walk-off-ebdf11b6995a"&gt;Instacart shoppers staged a strike&lt;/a&gt; to push the company for better protective gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ1J4TN8G-1610581727.039400-thread-list_1610581754.040300"&gt;In June, Instacart announced it was changing the way it handled customer tips, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274540/instacart-tip-baiting-deceptive-shoppers-ftc-investigation-congress"&gt;announcement of a congressional inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the practice of tip-baiting. That’s when a customer rescinds or reduces a shopper’s tips after their order has been shopped and delivered. &lt;/p&gt;
