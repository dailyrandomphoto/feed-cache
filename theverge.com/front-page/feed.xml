    <title>Citing fires, London’s transport agency bans e-scooters on public transit network</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MoxkgC"&gt;Transport for London &lt;a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2021/december/tfl-announces-safety-ban-of-e-scooters-on-transport-network"&gt;announced a ban on all e-scooters&lt;/a&gt; on its network, effective December 13th, over safety concerns following recent fires. The ban will apply to all public transport in London, including underground trains and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alhAhv"&gt;E-scooters are currently banned on UK roads and sidewalks, but shops can still sell them for use on private land. The only legal e-scooters in use in London are the ones part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440320/london-electric-scooter-rental-trial-dott-lime-tier"&gt;rental trials that started over the summer&lt;/a&gt;. The ban does not include mobility scooters that are permitted on TfL’s network, and foldable e-bikes are still permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5HrBU"&gt;“We have been extremely worried by the recent incidents on our public transport services, which involved intense fires and considerable smoke and damage,” said TfL’s chief safety, health, and environment officer Lilli Matson. “We have worked with London Fire Brigade to determine how we should deal with these devices and, following that review, we have decided to ban them. Customers who try to bring them onto our network will be refused access to our stations and premises, and not be permitted to use any of our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJjbdl"&gt;TfL did not reference specific fires, but local news &lt;a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/1515958/electric-scooter-london-underground-battery-fire-explosion"&gt;reported on an incident&lt;/a&gt; in November, when an e-scooter exploded in a London Underground station, causing black smoke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hHmjXt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exclusive - Footage shows the dangers of escooter battery fires on the tube. This happened on Monday night. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TSSAunion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TSSAunion&lt;/a&gt; calling for a ban on carrying escooters on public transport saying they’re a “significant threat”.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2pxsW"&gt;The transport agency said the incidents it referenced were caused by “defective lithium-ion batteries which ruptured without warning,” which led to fires that cause toxic smoke. If such a fire happened in an enclosed area, it could lead to significant harm to staff and customers, TfL said in its news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tpNV8"&gt;Anyone who violates the ban could face a fine of up to £1,000 (about $1,300 USD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="johXIR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smart home company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s HomeKit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnW9VfhCNWpOs0U3DDdAmYgUKuc=/0x1169:4247x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254547/Eve_Energy_Lifestyle_US_Christmas_2020_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve is upgrading all its compatible products —such as its Eve Energy smart plug — to the Matter smart home standard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve Home&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yrI7o"&gt;Eve, the makers of high-end Apple HomeKit smart home gadgets for home security, energy, and lighting, has been leading the charge for the new Matter standard for a while now, specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;its primary protocol Thread&lt;/a&gt;. As one of the first device makers to release Thread-based products, Eve just announced its tenth device to get the promised hardware upgrade — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;$99.99 Eve Room indoor air quality monitor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2QdSa"&gt;With almost half of its existing products now Thread-enabled and ready for Matter, the company is turning its attention to the rest of its portfolio. Jerome Gackel, CEO of Eve Systems, confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Eve will be launching a Thread-enabled Eve Water Guard (a leak detector) in February 2022 and an Eve Flare (a portable lamp) in March; and Thread versions of the Eve Light Switch (a hardwired wall switch) and the Eve Motion (a motion sensor) will follow shortly. These two products are getting more than just a new radio, however, both will get an entirely new design, says Gackel. The new Eve Motion will include a luminosity sensor (a digital light sensor).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpmek897yWnDILLgRtgYdOzPbu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078440/Image_12_10_21_at_9.01_AM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve Home&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve Room — an indoor air quality monitor with an E Ink screen — is the latest Eve product to receive a hardware upgrade to Thread.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="edj8nx"&gt;The company is also entering a brand-new product category: smart shades. &lt;a href="https://motionblinds.com/eve/"&gt;Eve MotionBlinds&lt;/a&gt; are rechargeable battery-powered smart motors for &lt;a href="https://coulisse.com/"&gt;Coulisse shades&lt;/a&gt;. They will launch in January and will be HomeKit certified alongside using a Thread radio and being upgraded to Matter when the standard launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnLXYI"&gt;Eve has committed to upgrading all its existing compatible devices to Matter when the standard is expected to arrive in June 2022, starting with its US smart plug Eve Energy and the Eve Motion and Eve Door &amp;amp; Window sensors. The second rollout will cover its light switches (US and European versions), the Eve Thermo radiator valve in the fall, and Eve Weather, Eve Room, and Eve Energy (UK and Australian editions) at the end of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHKq7H"&gt;This leaves only the company’s indoor camera out of the Thread party (at least in terms of its US products). The Eve Cam works over Wi-Fi, which is supported by Matter, but cameras aren’t part of the Matter specification yet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQd93_3VeHfCWstVhZ59_GGMuzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078456/Eve_Weather_Lifestyle_12_Fahrenheit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve Home&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Weather is one of Eve’s ten products that have already received the hardware upgrade to Thread, along with the Eve Aqua, Eve Door &amp;amp; Window sensor, and Eve Energy smart plug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7LQC2f"&gt;However, as Gackle &lt;a href="https://staceyoniot.com/iot-news-of-the-week-for-dec-3-2021/"&gt;first told Stacey Higginbotham&lt;/a&gt;, some customers may not want to rush to Matter initially. “It’s a reality that when Matter launches, it won’t support every functionality of every manufacturer’s devices right away,” Gackel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Over time, it will. So, if a user is specifically using an Eve device for function X, Y, or Z, they should confirm it will be supported at Matter’s launch, or possibly choose to stay on HomeKit via Thread until it (function X, Y, or Z) is supported in the near future.” Gackel says he’s confident that all the functions will be supported on Matter over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TW73LW"&gt;Eve says its switchover from Bluetooth to Thread has already been “a spectacular success” for the company, helping improve its sensors’ speed, range, reliability, and battery life. “We’ve had roughly more than 5,000 emails from happy customers telling us how good it is now,” says Gackel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkStQS"&gt;And while Thread devices require a border router (such as a HomePod Mini) to communicate with each other, Gackel is confident these will quickly become ubiquitous. “We believe more and more Wi-Fi routers will embed Thread directly, as with Eero today,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yKcmmU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Matter is clearly a game-changer in the smart home” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hVdxw"&gt;To date, Eve has been an Apple HomeKit-only option due to the company’s commitment to not using a cloud-based system. This has meant no Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or Samsung SmartThings integrations. Also, no Android support. With Matter, Eve can branch out without giving up its core privacy-first, no-cloud principles, as the new smart home standard is an entirely local protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4f8fQV"&gt;With Matter, the connection to Alexa and Google will be local and won’t require cloud-to-cloud communication. “So, we will keep this uniqueness of privacy,” says Gackel. “Matter is clearly a game-changer in the smart home. In 2022 when a product is Matter-certified, you have the guarantee that it works seamlessly with all the four major platforms — Google, Apple, Amazon, and Samsung — and with whatever smartphone is in the hand of the consumer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VefHlB"&gt;Eve is already working toward compatibility with Samsung, SmartThings, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home, and Gackel says it’s been selected by each company for its early adopter program. Currently, Eve’s app only works on iPhones. Gackel says the company is still determining whether to develop an Android app or whether integration with Matter will be enough to make its products accessible to all smart home users, not just those with Apple iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FO85q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The e-bike revolution comes to the Bronx</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vO83QNmT2m8fGaZBoLrxRwsDbLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254544/ahawkins_211202_4915_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;E-bike companies are teaming up with local non-profits to provide discounts to frontline workers. Could this be a nationwide model?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uYylyH"&gt;On a recent chilly December afternoon, a small parking lot in the industrial Hunts Point section of the Bronx was alive with the sounds of bicycle bells. Representatives from companies like VanMoof, Rad Power Bikes, Zomoo, and others were mingling about a half dozen local residents — drivers, janitors, landscapers, and home health aides — initiating them in the burgeoning electric bike revolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gc7fmw"&gt;These were the first participants in &lt;a href="https://equitablecommuteproject.carrd.co/"&gt;the Equitable Commute Project&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based coalition of non-profit organizations, strategy groups, university researchers, and financial lenders. The goal was to make e-bikes more accessible and more affordable to people in low-income communities, reduce their dependence on cars, and ultimately, create more jobs in the green economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uUz2K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Where’s my training wheels?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RSKEZ4"&gt;Michael Scanlon, a driver for the Hope Program, a workforce development non-profit involved in the project, was there to pick up a brand new VanMoof e-bike. A hefty guy with graying hair and a thick New York accent, Scanlon had only one question after listening to a representative from the Dutch company run through the bike’s features: “Where’s my training wheels?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQTmVF"&gt;But after taking his new e-bike out for an inaugural spin, Scanlon’s New York attitude melted away. “It’s been a rough year for me, personally,” he told me. “I had a pacemaker put in, a gallbladder taken out, three deaths in the family. So I wanted to buy myself a little Christmas gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HNjlmJzHYzibW_GI3IrsReUGls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070378/ahawkins_211202_4915_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Scanlon, a driver from the Bronx, tries out his new VanMoof e-bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R6FDnT"&gt;Scanlon will have some help. Through a partnership with Spring Bank and grants from the state government, the Equitable Commute Project is hoping to subsidize the cost of his VanMoof by up to 50 percent. That means instead of shelling out $2,298 for the S3 e-bike, he would only have to pay $1,149. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Il7tYL"&gt;Across the country, community groups are soliciting e-bike companies for help competing for state money in the hopes of getting more people riding. Cities like &lt;a href="https://bikeportland.org/2021/01/27/pge-grants-will-stoke-e-bike-boom-in-portland-325318"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/zero-emission-vehicles/can-do-colorado-ebike-pilot-program"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sharedmobility.org/e-bikepilot"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; are launching pilot projects that explore ways to subsidize e-bike purchases for low-income families or collect enough bikes together to launch mini-shared micromobility services. But the goal isn’t just to get more people on e-bikes; it’s also about reducing tailpipe emissions and saving the planet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2n4ipo"&gt;​​E-bikes are more expensive than normal bikes, typically costing anywhere from $1,000 to $8,000 for some high-end cargo bikes. But they also have the potential to replace car trips for a lot of people, which could help make real progress in the fight against climate change. A recent study found that if just 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a33798099/e-bikes-can-reduce-carbon-emissions-study/#:~:text=Take%20an%20E%2DBike%20to,emissions%20would%20drop%2012%20percent.&amp;amp;text=Research%20from%20a%20recent%20study,reducing%20carbon%20emissions%20in%20cities."&gt;carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="moZPQH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s the climate piece of ‘let’s get people out of cars and onto bikes’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oABHfv"&gt;“There’s the climate piece of ‘let’s get people out of cars and onto bikes,’” said Ash Lovell, e-bike campaign coordinator for People for Bikes, a group that lobbies on behalf of the bike industry. “The more people you get on bikes, the safer biking is for everyone [and] the more incentive there is to build better biking infrastructure. And the more people you get out of cars, the less traffic congestion you have and the better air quality you have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MVgxx"&gt;Depending on where you live, people interested in buying an e-bike can get financial assistance in the form of a rebate or tax credit. California, for example, offer a range of financial assistance to residents, &lt;a href="https://www.calbike.org/4-ways-to-get-financial-help-to-buy-an-e-bike/"&gt;including a tax credit&lt;/a&gt; for people who trade in their polluting car for an e-bike. And e-bikes could get a huge boost if Congress approves President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751273/ebike-tax-credit-build-back-better-biden"&gt;a tax credit of up to $900 for e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR0GNp"&gt;But rebates and tax credits aren’t the best way to get more people from low-income communities using e-bikes, said Melinda Hanson, founder of Electric Avenue, a strategy firm that helped launch the Equitable Commute Project in the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="potO4y"&gt;“These feel nebulous for most consumers,” she said. “Subsidies at the purchase point are more tangible and likely to be much more effective, especially for lower-income folks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvidkxvNSpAcL3vGUoOqa8pi8Rg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070380/ahawkins_211202_4915_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A representative from VanMoof gives an overview of the company’s e-bikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="azm2tU"&gt;Hanson said the project aims to eventually provide bikes to 5,000 people in the Bronx and Brooklyn. Manufacturers like VanMoof, Rad Power Bikes, and Zoomo are covering the subsidy costs for this initial batch of e-bikes, but the project leaders are hoping that fundraising, and a &lt;a href="https://www.electricmobilitychallenge.org/"&gt;$7 million grant from New York State&lt;/a&gt;, will help provide the cash that’s needed to offer future discounts. The group has built out a list of 600 interested people and has had to limit outreach while it continues to fundraise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtfzhj"&gt;Unlike a rebate or a tax credit, the Equitable Commute Project is working with Spring Bank to launch a new financing product to cover the remaining balance of the bike. It’s accessible to those with little or no credit history and is repaid through paycheck deductions with their employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FckUSu"&gt;&lt;q&gt; e-bike loans of up to $2,500&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="28aZA8"&gt;The project has focused its outreach on institutions in the Bronx that employ large numbers of frontline workers, including BronxWorks, Montefiore Medical Center, and Urban Health Network. According to Melanie Stern, director of consumer lending at Spring Bank, frontline workers can access e-bike loans of up to $2,500 or Employee Opportunity loans of up to $3,500. “The process is fintech-enabled,” Stern said, “so participating is really simple both for the employer and the borrower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQ54DJ"&gt;The project is also proving to be a convenient opportunity for transportation researchers to learn more about the interaction between cyclists and motor vehicles. Suzana Duran Bernardes is a PhD candidate at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering. Working with the university’s &lt;a href="https://c2smart.engineering.nyu.edu/"&gt;C2SMART Center&lt;/a&gt;, she came up with a device that attaches to the downtube of the e-bikes that are being distributed by the Equitable Commute Project. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DX1rQAMBWQodtV4i1AKbt0P_kq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070376/ahawkins_211202_4915_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A sensor used by NYU researchers to gather data about bike usage. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xpGnOW"&gt;While the person is riding, the sensors collect data on speed, acceleration, distance, and trajectory, as well as the proximity of other cars and trucks on the road. The goal is to learn more about how people use e-bikes and produce studies into safety, gender equity in cycling, and urban planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbmJMM"&gt;“We want to benefit as many of the people as possible,” Duran Bernardes said. “Agencies, researchers, cyclists... this data can be useful to everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrs1k1"&gt;One of those people who could use some more assurances about the safety of cycling is Shakira Hart, a supervisor for a local landscaping company. Hart, who lives in the Bronx, doesn’t own a car and usually walks to work, no matter the weather. An e-bike will help cut her commute time in half — but first, she has to learn how to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qJa5c5"&gt;“There’s a little bit more technicality than I prefer,” Hart said while straddling her new bike from Zoomo. “I figure, you know, once I review the manual, I’ll be good.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook finally has live chat support for people who are locked out of their accounts</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HUoFkY"&gt;Despite eagerly participating in a platform vs. platform war of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791007/facebook-live-audio-rooms-paying-creators-musicians"&gt;escalating financial incentives to attract creators&lt;/a&gt;, one area where critics have said Facebook / Meta / Instagram is lacking is in the ability to provide basic support for those online stars. Whether that’s through community moderation and page management tools or making sure they have someone to reach if they’re locked out of their account suddenly, it has been a consistent issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlDqT2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/comment-moderation-and-support"&gt;Now it’s trying to change that&lt;/a&gt;, announcing a “small test” of live chat support for English-speaking creators in the US who don’t have an assigned relationship manager. That way these midtier internet stars can get a quick response if they have questions about a payout, or, for example, how to use a new feature for Instagram Reels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgLBe"&gt;Another element that’s even more crucial is for those who are locked out of their account for one reason or another. A report by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/creators-instagram-dealers-restore-accounts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August detailed an underground economy of people who claim to have inside access at Meta and charge money to help with account restoration. For people who use social media as their business, they may feel they have no choice but to pay, especially when normal customer support avenues are unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook Support on iOS" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LWrpEl0hMRpW8kEftuw3bbAUNg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078462/facebook_support.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Support on iOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0GADP4"&gt;Facebook says it’s now testing “live chat help for some English-speaking users globally, including creators, who’ve been locked out of their accounts.” The company says it’s the first time it has offered live support for the issue and that it’s focusing on people who can’t log in either due to unusual activity or because they’ve reportedly violated its community standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook ‘spotlight conversation’" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VlcoBu7ioa72AbXRNrfb4TeH2yU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23078468/comment_0facebook.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s “spotlight conversation”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qtUV1g"&gt;Other changes it’s announced this week include better comment moderation with keyword blocking, moderation assistance that can auto-hide comments with links or images, the ability to block a user along with any new accounts they try to make later, and a dedicated spot to view hidden comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJS262"&gt;If you’re trying to go live and build a fan base, then you’ll be able to do it with more people, as Facebook has added the ability co-broadcast with up to three additional guests. You can also share those live broadcasts as Facebook Stories that pop to the top of your followers’ feeds, as well as badges and front row privileges that make it easier for the host to know when particularly dedicated fans are watching. Finally, video hosts can also add featured links that viewers can click without leaving the video and polls that work on mobile just like they already did on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the real NASA scientist behind Netflix’s Don’t Look Up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“Don’t Look Up” World Premiere" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6NcJFvn5xQFu7gExPoSQ7y3HW0=/1x0:4927x3284/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254389/1357492447.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p6OpZr"&gt;In Netflix’s new star-studded space comedy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822107/dont-look-up-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists scramble to save the world from a “planet-killer.” In the movie, it’s a comet. In the real world, humans are more likely to conjure up the vehicle of our demise all on our own, whether it’s through climate change or the patriarchy. The movie gets into those thorny themes, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LoIHb"&gt;It opens with a scene in which a grad student played by Jennifer Lawrence discovers the comet, something real-world NASA astronomer Amy Mainzer has experience with. Just last year, Mainzer and her team discovered the brightest comet in the northern hemisphere in more than two decades, called &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146996/comet-neowise-brightens-the-night"&gt;NEOWISE&lt;/a&gt;. To flesh out Lawrence’s character and the other scientists in the film — and bring some real science to a movie about the end of times — the actors took cues from Mainzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iWDY6A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The end of the world and what to do about it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DU61gV"&gt;Mainzer happens to be “one of the world’s leading scientists in asteroid detection and planetary defense,” &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-committee/members/dr-amy-mainzer"&gt;according to NASA&lt;/a&gt;, and she has also turned her attention to climate change (she’s using remote sensing to find invasive species that fuel wildfires). &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; talked with Mainzer about the end of the world and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYYASn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwlMdb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASA recently &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22797714/nasa-dart-asteroid-planetary-defense-redirect-crash-course-launch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;launched a spacecraft to slam into an asteroid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to see if it can deflect one that might collide with Earth in the future. How does that, the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DART &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0OUvEh3HWk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, compare to the worst-case scenario in the movie?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UD6WoD"&gt;There’s a number of different techniques you can try depending on how much time you have, how big the object is, and other details like what it’s made out of, and so on. What you see in the movie is obviously a very worst-case scenario. It’s also extremely unlikely to ever happen in our lifetimes or even a couple generations down for most lifetimes. That’s the great news. If the object is small enough and you have enough time, you can try the technique that the DART mission will demonstrate, which is to just bump into it and try to push it out of the way. That’s the simplest thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y32ZX9"&gt;However, all of these techniques depend on the ability to find the objects ahead of time and make sure that we know enough about them, their sizes, and just exactly where they’re going to go so that we have a number of different options available to us. So that’s what I’m working on is the search and discovery part of it. The next planetary defense mission that NASA will be launching is a project that I worked on called the Near-Earth Object Surveyor, which is designed to go out and find a whole bunch more asteroids and comets, hopefully when they are years to decades before any potential close approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NZp0HK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbIxYm3mKzI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="El2DF2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope people take away from this movie?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0At3vR"&gt;That science is really important in our everyday lives. Even if we don’t necessarily think about it, it’s there. It’s operating on our lives, the physical processes that determine how the world works. Those are happening to us. We see it every day with the pandemic, with climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74ERel"&gt;We really hope people will take into consideration science when they make their decisions, both as individuals and as a society. If we use the tools of science that we have at our disposal, we are much more likely to have a good outcome in our day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpfPJp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you work with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence on this film? What was that like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oaVQ2"&gt;They were really fantastic to work with because both of them, and Rob Morgan [who plays Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe, head of planetary defense at NASA], too, they are all huge nerds. I mean that as a compliment. They are really interested in and passionate about science themselves. And also, too, I think they were very interested in portraying scientists as fully realized human beings. Very often in film, we see scientists as caricatures. Either they’re kind of a joke, or they’re evil or something that just doesn’t really represent scientists as people doing a job and trying to do the job the best they can. So this was really an important part of the movie. I hope that people get a little bit of a sense of who scientists are as people through watching it. And I think that the cast did a great job of really bringing humanity to scientists who are just trying to do their jobs to bring what they’re learning to everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IbLhJ6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Leo and Jen are just about halfway through their PhDs in orbital dynamics”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9aEdQd"&gt;Oh, gosh, we had so many Zoom calls. All the Zoom calls. We were texting and Zoom calls and phone calls and FaceTime — and really trying to work through some of the logistical challenges. You’ll see in the movie, there’s sort of a debate about the role of activism. If you’re a scientist, and you have news to bring to everybody that’s not good, what do you do? Do you try to say it in a way that is polite? Do you try to protest in the streets? Do you try to work with people who are in power even if you profoundly disagree with them? What do you do? So we really worked on how do we present that in a way that is believable and helps to humanize the characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kok1dH"&gt;And then, of course, the dialogue. Some of it’s extremely technical, and I gotta say, both Leo and Jen are just about halfway through their PhDs in orbital dynamics at this point. So they really gave it their all on some extremely challenging technical dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQqcuc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing that I felt really humanized these characters was their own feelings of anxiety and fear or panic or whatever it is when you’re working daily on a potential apocalypse. For you as a scientist, how do you sort of manage that sense of existential crisis when it comes to something like climate change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqLOC0"&gt;Well, I gotta say, we watch a lot of comedies in my household. So hopefully, people will enjoy &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; as a comedy because humor is partly how we do cope with serious news. And that’s what helps us keep going. So finding good friends and good people to work with who are supportive and kind. But also just, you know, finding the moments of joy and levity where you can work on a serious subject, it’s essential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlMUDC"&gt;That’s where I think the role of the arts is really important. You know, science teaches us about the nature of the world around us, both good and bad. But the arts are really what allow us to kind of process what we’re learning about that, bring it to other people, help bring it home to them. And then it helps us cope, not just as scientists, but as people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuIxe7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can relate to that as a science reporter. And another aspect of the film that I appreciated was that there are some obvious double standards that Jennifer Lawrence faces as a scientist in the film compared to her male colleague played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Did you consult on that aspect as well? What has it been like for you as a woman working in science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxjfHY"&gt;Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job on this aspect of the character. And you can see a number of instances in the film where she just faces this really institutionalized misogyny. That’s just pervasive, and it absolutely affects her work. It slows her down. You can see it’s a real drain on her energy as a person and as a scientist. That, of course, is unfortunately really prevalent throughout the sciences. It’s there. It’s real. It’s in many different fields. And, of course, it’s based on many aspects of identity, not just gender. The thing that I think is hopeful in the situation — I always do try to look for the hopeful thing — is that there’s been a lot of excellent work in the social sciences now to try to help figure out the best ways from a scientific standpoint, to combat some of this. To, in other words, improve the situation using the tools of science. We ourselves can be subjects for study, and other scientists can help us try to figure out how can we best alleviate the situation? So that brings me some hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcgB7m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Herx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to (hopefully) restore your Gmail account if you lose access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1_ww5Je9CHaSqV4StyMDu0GEvEU=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676764/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_gmail.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a good idea to prepare ahead of time in case of problems&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gtKJ5H"&gt;Losing access to your Google / Gmail account can be an incredibly frustrating and unhappy experience. When researching this article, I came across several accounts of people who had been locked out of their accounts after forgetting their passwords — and a few who had still not been able to get back in, even after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svP0el"&gt;Google does provide a list of methods to try if you’ve been locked out of your account — either because you’ve forgotten your password or because somebody has hacked into your account and changed it. Sometimes, they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kcktv"&gt;Your options beyond Google’s suggestions may be limited, so it’s best to be prepared ahead of time. Here are some suggestions to place you in the best possible position to get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Vo9Kz2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T2wfAk"&gt;Back up your account regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nVKAM2"&gt;If you should ever (knock on wood) lose access to your account, it will be less of a blow — and is less likely to get your blood pressure shooting up — if you have a recent backup of your data. Google provides a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324801/gmail-download-data-back-up-save-email"&gt;means for you to download your data&lt;/a&gt; that it calls &lt;a href="https://takeout.google.com/"&gt;Takeout&lt;/a&gt;. You can download all the data from all of your Google apps, or from some of them, or just from a single app such as Gmail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbRPIo"&gt;The formats of the downloads vary depending on the type of data. Your email will be downloaded in the MBOX format, which can be then uploaded into another Gmail account or into most other email services or apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C0bOr5"&gt;Use a password manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jFUZHt"&gt;An ounce of prevention being worth — well, you know the rest — the best way to prevent yourself from losing access to a Google account because of a lost password is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;use a password manager&lt;/a&gt; to keep your password safe. (And no, keeping your Google password in the Google Password Manager isn’t going to help.) Password managers like &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/"&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://1password.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/vault/"&gt;Zoho Vault&lt;/a&gt; can make sure that sudden brain freezes won’t keep you out of your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mWcn5L"&gt;Keep a record of your old password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jHAdHa"&gt;One of the ways Google verifies your identity if you lose your password is to ask you to type in your previous password. If it’s been a while since you changed your password (assuming you’ve ever actually changed it), it may be hard (or impossible) to remember that former password. So when you change your Google password — and it’s not a bad idea to change it regularly — keep a record of your old password somewhere safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii4UKx"&gt;A good strategy here is to use your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt; — you use one, right? — to keep track of old passwords. Most password managers will offer to update the existing entry for an app when you create a new password; if possible, you can opt instead to create a new entry and then go back and edit the old one to say something like “Gmail - old password.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lwPhOB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="64eb6L"&gt;If you’re not using a password manager (and if you’ve lost your password, there’s a good chance you’re not), then perhaps you can keep a list of old passwords in an encrypted file. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nc3TW"&gt;Worse comes to worst, Google suggests that you try to remember any password you’ve used in the past — or your best guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uspMs0"&gt;Check to see what recovery info is available&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VsoOfK"&gt;It’s a good idea to provide Google ahead of time with as much recovery info as you feel comfortable with, so that if you ever need to verify your identity, you have some choices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to include several ways to verify your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwZHcV3G1qT-Yr29qWcRrDI_ip8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758474/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_1.32.40_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to include several ways to verify your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uy3Pfl"&gt;Go to your &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/"&gt;Google account page&lt;/a&gt; and then click on “Security” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CBXRs3"&gt;Scroll down to “Ways we can verify it’s you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E5lRzg"&gt;You’ll see whether you’ve registered a recovery phone number or a recovery email. (Note: if you entered an answer to a security question sometime in the past, you’ll see that in the listing as well; however, if you click on it, you’ll get a notice telling you that Google no longer supports security questions.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fSpqaJ"&gt;If you don’t have any of these filled in, it may be a good idea to fill in at least one. If you want to be really careful, go ahead and enter your info. Here’s how.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X22Zz0"&gt;Set up a recovery email account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nCwCyn"&gt;Your recovery email account can be another Gmail account, another email account from a different service, or even a relative’s or friend’s account. (Make sure that relative or friend is security-savvy.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Jhhcq1"&gt;Go to the “Ways we can verify it’s you” section (see above) and click on “Recovery email.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyh4xV"&gt;Type in your chosen recovery email address and click on “Verify.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NT7aEC"&gt;Google will send a six-digit verification code to the email address you entered. Go to your email, copy the code, and go back to the recovery page to enter the code. (You have 24 hours before you have to get another code.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jtw2uv"&gt;You should get a small pop-up indicating that your recovery email has been verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can include a verified recovery email to help in the recovery of your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ITT8LLecGGmffJYwszYTSFWMdgY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758605/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_10.44.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can include a verified recovery email to help in the recovery of your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gIzqgg"&gt;Set up a recovery phone number:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8T9xMw"&gt;Go to the “Ways we can verify it’s you” section (see above) and click on “Recovery email.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alQHGG"&gt;Click on “Add Recovery Phone” and enter the phone number in the pop-up box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eLBfQE"&gt;Google will text you a verification code at that phone number. Enter it in the pop-up box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;img alt="You can also add a recovery phone number; Google will call or text you with a code." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GA-X00bjfVVoj730rFTEZsRpk5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758604/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_1.47.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also add a recovery phone number; Google will call or text you with a code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kyBxDl"&gt;Remember when you started the account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WuxyIv"&gt;If all else fails, Google may ask you approximately when you created the account. Personally, I have no idea when I started most of my Gmail accounts; if you want to check out when you started yours, probably the easiest way is to find your earliest Gmails (now, when you have access to your account) and keep that info somewhere safe. (This, of course, assumes that you haven’t been efficient enough to delete all your old emails; in that case, this won’t help.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="88VOnl"&gt;In your Gmail account, go to the left-hand menu, find “All Mail,” and click on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PHd2Ek"&gt;Look in the upper right corner for the number of emails you have. (It will say something like “1-50 of 2,000.”) Click on that and select “Oldest.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mctaa4"&gt;Your email will now sort in the order of oldest first; if you (like me) haven’t been very good about deleting email, this should give you some idea of when you started the account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finding your oldest emails may help you remember when you started your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTU7c49LcjSANonAL3lqSRoJA6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758621/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_3.10.43_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding your oldest emails may help you remember when you started your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qn147Q"&gt;Google does &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973?hl=en"&gt;offer some other pieces of advice&lt;/a&gt; for those who are having trouble restoring their websites, including sending all the info you can using your usual computer, in the same location that you usually compute in, and with your usual browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uLTlJo"&gt;Recover your password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W6iBqo"&gt;So what if you actually do lose your password or can’t get into your account for another reason? Well, you go to &lt;a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery"&gt;Google’s recovery page&lt;/a&gt; and start answering those questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLmfWA"&gt;Unfortunately, when I tried it on a test account, I realized that my options were limited indeed. I was first asked for the last password I had used, then for a verification code from my alternate email, a verification code from my phone, and the answer to my security question (despite Google’s assertion that it no longer used security questions). When I claimed I didn’t have any of these available, the last screen simply urged me to try again. I went through the whole rigmarole again — and was again urged to “Try again.” There was no alternative offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fuFmK"&gt;You can also try going to the “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/2402620"&gt;Can’t sign into your Google Account&lt;/a&gt;” page and selecting one or more of the choices offered to see if there are any other options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Following along with one of these issues may help you recover your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_TuKrDLVTbbbbc57CaEeoPPeno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758641/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_12.34.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following along with one of these issues may help you recover your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HL3P7j"&gt;But be aware that, even if you can enter the information Google’s bots ask for, it may not be enough. Back in 2017, tech journalist Ron Miller got locked out of his Google account; in an article, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/that-time-i-got-locked-out-of-my-google-account-for-a-month/"&gt;he described his considerable travails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlw5q4"&gt;So what can you do? If you really want to keep your emails — and other Google data — available, make sure you have as many ways to restore your account as possible, and don’t forget to back it all up, just in case. Otherwise, after trying everything you can, you may have to do what Google suggests at the bottom of its “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973?hl=en"&gt;Tips to complete account recovery steps&lt;/a&gt;” page — and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7564124"&gt;create a new account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqnth4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 10th, 2021, 9AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on August 4th, 2021, and has been updated to add information on password managers, and to reflect current methods and options in Gmail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s latest models are getting big discounts today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqAk1iPz3Yvsd-FDxAOQaJEwQc0=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70254135/jpeters_210912_4757_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TtXXOX"&gt;Many of Fitbit’s wearables are currently enjoying solid discounts at multiple retailers. A pair of highlights we noticed include the Fitbit Charge 5, normally $179.99, which has been discounted to just $130 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nl8R6oaf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgaH2ek1F7t" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Fitbit Versa 3 has been lowered to $179.99&lt;/a&gt; from its regular $229.99 price tag at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Lgnwg"&gt;While the Fitbit Charge 5 does suffer from a relatively small touchscreen, the lightweight design and excellent battery life are a far more tempting offer at this price point. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XWVIe"&gt;We haven’t had a chance to review the Versa 3 yet; however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/victoria-song" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our wearables reviewer, Victoria Song&lt;/a&gt;, definitely recommends this Apple Watch look-alike at this price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqgskY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="RuYzV6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="brx1s0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best smartwatch to buy if you have an Android phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20959753/best-smartwatch-android-samsung-galaxy-google-wear-os-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9mNbxu"&gt;Two variations of Samsung’s 8.7-inch Galaxy Tab A7 Android tablet are currently at their lowest prices ever at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgaH6MKqPOS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The base model with 32GB of storage has been reduced to just $120&lt;/a&gt;, taking $40 off the regular price. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgaH7AMoAsX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The model that doubles the storage is $70 off, available for $130&lt;/a&gt;. This discount applies to both the dark gray and silver colorways. It’s worth noting that Best Buy is offering 20 percent off on a qualifying accessory when purchased with the tablet, netting you additional savings on things like screen protectors and cases, if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uU7fcF"&gt;Both tablets feature a 1340 x 800 resolution display and boast the Android 11 OS. And while the camera quality and performance aren’t going to win any awards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our reviewer Dan Seifert&lt;/a&gt; was still impressed by the overall build quality and battery life of this budget-friendly tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HvE6CA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="q6Iory"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best tablet you can buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/11/16122668/best-tablet-ipad-samsung-galaxy-tab-android-windows"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0cLHLG"&gt;Both flagship models of Sony’s noise-canceling headphones are still getting deep discounts at multiple retailers. The Sony WF-1000XM4 noise-canceling earbuds are currently available at both &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F846848972&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cga3AaiRoFr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $248, shaving $31.99 off the retail price. If you’re looking for something with a slightly more robust sound or just something to keep your ears warm during the winter months, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cga3wgnsuGg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582549-REG%2Fsony_wh1000xm4_b_wh_1000xm4_wireless_noise_canceling_over_ear.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F10%2F22826319%2Ffitbit-versa-charge-sony-headphones-samsung-tablet-logitech-headset-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; are currently selling the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones for $248, knocking $101.99 of the regular MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFxHS7"&gt;The XM4 earbuds and headphones occupy top spots in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;noise-canceling headphone&lt;/a&gt; roundups for a few good reasons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Welch, who reviewed both the WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, was thoroughly impressed by the overall sound quality and noise-cancellation features of both of these products, even calling the earbuds “a sonic triumph.” You probably won’t regret treating yourself to either of these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ML4lrx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848037"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AojoMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885838"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GdeLkG"&gt;While gaming accessories will almost &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;be available in black, it’s nice to see Logitech branching out by offering its peripherals in a wide variety of outrageous color combinations. Currently, the Logitech G435 headset is available in three colorways at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLogitech-G435-LIGHTSPEED-Bluetooth-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Lightweight-over-ear-headphones-built-in-mics-18h-battery-compatible-Dolby-Atmos-PC-PS4-PS%2F377935551&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup120921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0Ap1jmugG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G435-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08R8DT7X6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $69.99, taking $10 off the regular price. While you can always go with black, this universally compatible headset also comes in white with light blue accents, as well as a vivid pink and blue combo. The G435 can last up to 18 hours between charging and can pair with devices either through Bluetooth or with the included 2.4GHz wireless dongle. This model is currently our top pick if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tribal communities are facing a new threat: Instagram</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HvUvZRkeVVraogrWaEcuXBIccyo=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253973/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Tribe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Viral photos are becoming a sore spot for protected sites&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lzDQPL"&gt;At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown last year, with most indoor activities canceled, Crystal C’Bearing did what many others did: she went outside. C’Bearing and her family explored the beautiful mountains and rivers that surround their home on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. C’Bearing, who is the deputy director of the Northern Arapaho Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO), says she loved how many other families were also out enjoying the land. But from a cultural resource protection standpoint, she had concerns about people posting on social media about stone circles, petroglyphs, or other protected sites they found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDBrO1"&gt;“People see these things on social media and they want to come see it for themselves,” she explains. “They don’t realize the dynamics of the reservation and that we have our own laws and regulations that you need to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="273qAo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d25lvl"&gt;C’Bearing’s experience illustrates a growing challenge for Indigenous communities: how to protect tribal culture from the dangers of the attention economy. Non-Indigenous users often do not understand that the way they consume content on social media can pose a threat to Indigenous culture — and for tribes that have been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/native-american-boarding-schools/620760/"&gt;fighting against cultural eradication for generations&lt;/a&gt;, the stakes of what gets shared online couldn’t be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQQXpB"&gt;For C’Bearing, the damage done by the photos is tangible. Non-tribal hunters and fishers came to the landmark sites in unprecedented numbers, using motorized boats on reservation lakes and fishing in areas that are prohibited for religious or ecological reasons. Private planes chased animal herds from tribal land to private or state land — an explicit violation of tribal sovereignty and law. Where the tribe put up signs about prohibited behavior, trespassers tore them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyz0Q8"&gt;“We have these signs all over, they’re usually shot up, or taken down, or vandalized somehow,” C’Bearing says. “That’s what we face.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhHh7V"&gt;Decisions about privacy and security are complex for any community. On the Wind River Reservation, however, developing these policies means confronting a uniquely complicated history. Tribal reservations like Wind River are governed by &lt;a href="https://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/tribal-governance"&gt;sovereign Indigenous nations&lt;/a&gt; like the Northern Arapaho. There is a wide network of agencies, departments, and leaders that have input on reservation policy. The Northern Arapaho share the reservation with the Eastern Shoshone, who have their own Tribal Historic Preservation Office. Both THPOs would also likely have to work with other branches of tribal government and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. This bureaucratic complexity is due in part to policies that worked to eliminate tribal nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVs9Jl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wish more of our tribal members were out there”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt95VS"&gt;Another challenge is enforcement. The sheer size of the Wind River Reservation, which covers over 2 million acres (roughly three times the size of Rhode Island) and includes two mountain ranges, makes it difficult for the tribal fish and game department. For this vast area, the tribe currently only has five game wardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jzsgwz"&gt;The result has made some members less comfortable exploring their own land, knowing that an aggressive group of outsiders might already be camped out there. “There’s not many tribal members using those areas and that’s what it’s meant for,” she says. “And it’s just disturbing to me because I wish more of our tribal members were out there instead of non-tribal members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbZgIT"&gt;To reduce these infractions, C’Bearing is pushing for increased signage, greater enforcement capacity for tribal game wardens, and a stricter permitting process that would limit visitors to people who actually intend to hunt or fish in a respectful and legal way, rather than poachers or people just trying to find a cool cultural site they saw on a Facebook post. All of these initiatives will require support and investment from tribal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HvmK0"&gt;For now, the administration has implored individual citizens to take photos of anyone they see violating reservation law — but it’s an informal system, and C’Bearing says it’s overmatched by the torrent of outsiders over the past year. C’Bearing has also been encouraging individual tribal members to contact her office directly rather than posting publicly on social media, leading to Facebook messages warning of endangered fossil areas or problematic posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JTrI5"&gt;“All it takes is one person,” C’Bearing says, for a seemingly harmless Facebook post to turn into a threat to the reservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="41ehON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It shouldn’t come at the cost of non-Natives exploiting Indigenous people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9zN7Ob"&gt;The question of exploitation is especially urgent on social media, says Amanda Cheromiah, Laguna Pueblo and the director of the Native SOAR mentorship program at the University of Arizona. Cheromiah sees social media platforms as a powerful way to preserve Indigenous culture because of how quickly a post can go viral and spread to Indigenous people anywhere in the world. Of course, that virality comes with the risk of non-Indigenous people abusing it — Cheromiah has seen non-Indigenous kids mimicking Pueblo dances they saw on TikTok, imitations that often play on stereotypes or strip the dances of important cultural context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAQrXP"&gt;“These things are becoming more accessible, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of non-Natives exploiting Indigenous people again,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrMsJ1"&gt;Cheromiah is &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drcheromiah"&gt;an active TikTok user&lt;/a&gt;, posting about Indigenous life, as well as informational videos for Indigenous students and non-Indigenous people who might want to learn about Indigenous culture. Cheromiah has nearly 20,000 followers on the platform and her videos regularly get tens of thousands of views. Balancing access and knowledge with protecting culture and tradition is a constant battle, but the key, Cheromiah tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is giving Indigenous people space to express themselves and let them decide what can be shared and when. “Let’s increase our digital imprint the way we want to do it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jthmAq"&gt;It’s part of a larger anxiety in tribal communities, who are also in the midst of digitizing a vast store of cultural knowledge. As archivists strive to make materials more accessible, they also worry about them losing cultural context in the digital world. Donovan Pete, the acting program supervisor at the &lt;a href="https://navajocountylibraries.org/Pages/Index/101221/office-of-navajo-nation-library"&gt;Navajo Nation Library&lt;/a&gt;, tries to make some materials available online while reserving others for in-person use. These restrictions help reduce the risk of duplication and exploitation, but also reflect Pete’s embrace of a more traditional, community-based way of learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmI5c9"&gt;“There’s a part where we do have an emphasis to be able to have language and culture out there, but not too much, because we’d rather have individuals come back home and be able to experience it themselves,” Pete says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6F97v"&gt;Pete is trying to envision a library system based on Navajo culture and traditions, rather than an American model. These efforts reflect the reality that, for most Indigenous communities, protecting culture isn’t as simple as restricting access to library materials. Part of the challenge is the extent to which Indigenous language and culture permeates all aspects of tribal life and politics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sJf0gt"&gt;Tribal elders, in particular, have been victimized by outsiders, leading many Indigenous communities to take extra precautions when digitizing their knowledge. “A lot of concern with elders is somebody taking their knowledge and profiting off of it and not coming back and helping the reservation,” C’Bearing says. “It’s happened before.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Julian Assange can be extradited to the US, rules UK High Court</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0by4Tl"&gt;The UK’s High Court has &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange-2/"&gt;approved the extradition&lt;/a&gt; of Julian Assange to the US. The decision reverses a ruling by a lower court in the UK that blocked the extradition on the grounds that imprisonment in the US was a threat to Assange’s mental health and increased his risk of suicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGcU5F"&gt;The US government has now successfully appealed this decision by offering a &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/USA-v-Assange-summary-101221.pdf"&gt;number of assurances&lt;/a&gt; to British judges. These include assurances that Assange won’t be held in a “supermax” high-security prison during pretrial or if convicted (unless he “commits any future act which renders him liable to such conditions of detention”) and that the US will allow Assange to serve any final sentence in his native Australia, if he wishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usr2Bt"&gt;As reported by &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/julian-assange-high-court-reverses-decision-not-to-extradite-wikileaks-founder-to-the-us-12491646"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Assange’s fiancee, Stella Moris, said: “We will appeal this decision at the earliest possible moment.” Moris said the ruling was a “grave miscarriage of justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p8H8r4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How can it be fair [...] to extradite Julian to the very country which plotted to kill him?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vsEG6U"&gt;“How can it be fair, how can it be right, how can it be possible, to extradite Julian to the very country which plotted to kill him?” said Moris, referencing &lt;a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-assassination-and-a-london-shoot-out-inside-the-ci-as-secret-war-plans-against-wiki-leaks-090057786.html"&gt;reports earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that the CIA and Trump administration explored the possibility of kidnapping or assassinating Assange in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUB8dk"&gt;Assange has been indicted by US prosecutors on 18 counts, including 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse. He’s accused of conspiring to hack into US military computers in order to publish confidential military and diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison, though the US government claims the actual sentence will be between four and six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhA92J"&gt;The documents published by WikiLeaks exposed US wrongdoings in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. These include the so-called “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007,_Baghdad_airstrike"&gt;Collateral Murder&lt;/a&gt;” video, which showed US helicopter pilots in Baghdad killing a group of civilians including two Reuters journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYaPfS"&gt;Groups including Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International have called on the US to drop charges against Assange, saying that Assange’s work is legitimate journalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SvpZW"&gt;“Julian Assange’s publication of disclosed documents as part of his work with Wikileaks should not be punishable as this activity mirrors conduct that investigative journalists undertake regularly in their professional capacity,” says Amnesty. “Prosecuting Julian Assange on these charges could have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression, leading journalists to self-censor from fear of prosecution.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Witcher season 2 gets a little too serious on its quest to answer some big questions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="witcher season 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gsPAO4PKZumzFigDaTSGxIjgVI=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70253542/W_201_Unit_00288_RT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The new season is grander, but less playful, than the first  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9LmEXm"&gt;The first season of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;Netflix’s live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was a careful balancing act. In some ways, it was the service’s answer to &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, a bloody fantasy epic with a story that spanned a continent (and many years). But, in keeping with the source material, it was also a lot of fun. There were creepy monsters to hunt each episode, some great comic relief in the form of an annoying bard, as well as steamy bath scenes and a full-on orgy. It had everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wC5hKS"&gt;Season 2 attempts to up the fantasy stakes by focusing on some of the bigger, more existential questions about &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe, from the origins of monsters to why a young princess’s screams create earthquakes. The result is a show that has a more ambitious, epic feel and one that also loses some of the personality that made it such a hit in the first place. These issues mirror the trajectory of the books, but they feel more pronounced in a live-action series where so much depends on the characters and their performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2FfsL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: this review is based on the first six episodes of &lt;/em&gt;The Witcher&lt;em&gt; season 2 (there are eight in total) and contains light spoilers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVSKVt"&gt;The story picks up right after the events of season 1’s final episode, in which two important things happened. One, Geralt (a monster-hunting mutant played by Henry Cavill) and his ward Ciri (a princess with strange powers played by Freya Allan) finally reached each other after spending the past eight episodes seemingly running in parallel across an entire continent. At the same time, a huge battle ended after the mage — and Geralt’s on-again, off-again love interest — Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) channeled some dark forces to temporarily defeat an entire army. These events left the cast in some interesting places, which is right where season 2 kicks off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="witcher season 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Er5AziH2NULdZJUJn7JeP6pS9FQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076391/W_205_Unit_00111_RT.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiX4Vl"&gt;There’s a lot going on. At the outset, Geralt, always the lone wolf, is now a father figure and takes Ciri with him to Kaer Morhen — a secluded spot in the mountains that serves as the home base for the witchers — in order to keep her safe and plot his next move. Ciri takes this opportunity to train. After spending the first season almost entirely as a victim on the run, she wants to become strong enough to defend herself. Yennefer, meanwhile, is a prisoner of war who is now struggling with a very personal loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNHybo"&gt;Amidst all of the individual struggles, season 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; attempts to broach some big, universe-defining questions. At the center of it all is an event, often spoke of in passing, called the conjunction. Essentially, before the conjunction, there were different realms, or spheres, keeping the likes of humans, elves, and monsters separate. But the conjunction saw them forced together, creating the world as we know it in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. So many things are tied to this event — the sudden appearance of new monsters, Ciri’s powers, the existence of the witchers in the first place — that it serves as the connective tissue for pretty much everything happening. (If you’re looking for even more backstory, I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;the animated prequel movie &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides some great context for the history of witchers and monsters.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RSJ00"&gt;It’s interesting to see these larger questions at play, but the best part of this complicated setup is that it lets you see the main cast from all new perspectives. Geralt has become such a dad, focused almost entirely on Ciri’s well-being, even if it means upsetting the other witchers who just want to kill things and sleep for the winter. Ciri makes a dramatic turn into an incredibly determined budding warrior, while Yennefer is forced to deal with life after losing a defining part of her life. I won’t spoil too much about Jaskier (Joey Batey) other than to say he is no longer a happy-go-lucky bard — more like a lover scorned after his split from Geralt. (Seriously, just wait until you hear his new hit song.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSVH8C"&gt;This season also brings the woefully underused mage Trish Merigold (Anna Shaffer) into a much more prominent position and turns the seemingly heartless Fringilla (Mimi Ndiweni) into a surprisingly sympathetic leader. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; introduces some key new faces. Among them: Geralt’s mentor and father figure, Vesemir (Kim Bodnia), who is desperate to keep witchers from going extinct, a dark mage named Rience (Chris Fulton) tasked with finding Ciri, and Nenneke (Adjoa Andoh), a priestess who helps guide Geralt through this new (for him) territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="witcher season 2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSj-eNrzVA8P2dh0XVyccbkgzhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23076406/W_202_Unit_03248_RT.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iGBHEH"&gt;So yeah, there’s a lot going on, but it’s actually a little easier to keep things straight this time because, unlike season 1, everything is happening on the same timeline. (The show even pokes fun at the complexity of last season with a great self-aware joke.) I do miss the monster-of-the-week structure from 2019, but season 2 works because its central mysteries are so interesting, and the shifting perspectives on the main cast help keep it feeling distinct from what we’ve already seen. It’s not just more of the same. And the show still offers plenty of what I want from a &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; story. There are terrifying monsters (including a particularly unsettling vampire in the first episode), at least one sad death, and that very &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt;-specific kind of tragedy that makes you feel bad when a giant bug monster is murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnRo0I"&gt;But the bits it’s missing prove to be very important. &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is full of political intrigue and fantasy drama, but a core part of the appeal is also all of the sex and jokes. Season 2 is missing both. We still have Geralt’s sarcastic, dry quips, but I definitely realized how important Jaskier’s comedic relief was once it was almost entirely gone. It’s cool to see a new side of the character, but I wish he didn’t take all of the jokes along with him. Likewise, for a franchise where virtually every iteration — from the video game to the anime to the live-action series — is closely linked with an image of a buff man in a bath, it’s remarkable how sexless this season is. &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; is one of the rare dark fantasy stories where the sex is fun and joyful, rather than frequently tied to violence and rape. Now it’s virtually non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eoDJzQ"&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I still binged through the season incredibly quickly because I just had to see what happened next. The second season has great momentum that keeps it moving forward, along with an even more well-rounded cast than before. But it also felt like the show was slowly moving away from much of what made it so distinct. I love watching Geralt slice apart monsters and accidentally get caught up in political turmoil as much as anyone. But a few laughs along the way would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="929wse"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Witcher &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;season 2 debuts on Netflix on December 17th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
