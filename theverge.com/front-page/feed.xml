    <title>The FAA just greenlit this drone to fly autonomously without a human nearby</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M_P2zV5GXkbCaKih-dApmwwlImA=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676737/american_robotics_drone.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOAbKO"&gt;In October, the FAA took a major stride towards letting increasingly smart drones fly themselves, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;letting Skydio’s self-flying drones inspect any bridge in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; for four years, as long as humans first verified those bridges were clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yUP9v"&gt;Now, the US airspace regulator is taking an even bigger step: Aviation Robotics &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005587/en/American-Robotics-Becomes-First-Company-Approved-by-the-FAA-To-Operate-Automated-Drones-Without-Human-Operators-On-Site"&gt;says it’s become the first company&lt;/a&gt; allowed to operate drones without needing a human pilot or an observer anywhere near the aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oebkTp"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as big a deal as you’d expect from the company’s press release or &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s headline &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-approves-first-fully-automated-commercial-drone-flights-11610749377?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;“FAA Approves First Fully Automated Commercial Drone Flights,”&lt;/a&gt; because humans still need to be part of the equation: &lt;a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2019-0775-0008"&gt;FAA documents show&lt;/a&gt; that Aviation Robotics will still need to assign a human to each and every flight, who’ll run through a safety checklist before takeoff and inspect the aircraft with remote tools. They’re not fully automated yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zEb3t7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.338%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/438185792?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NG7v0z"&gt;But after that, the company’s drone-in-a-box Scout will take over and fly the mission — and automatically halt if needed. The Scout’s box includes &lt;a href="https://sara.com/tasa"&gt;an acoustic detection system&lt;/a&gt; that lets the drone sense and avoid other aircraft, which can spot one over two miles away and automatically force the drone to descend, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpwJxxsgPL-MQadptfHTZLzhNpE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22239563/ScoutBase___Doors_Closed__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by American Robotics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ScoutBase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2OEIxa"&gt;The FAA’s also only approving this waiver for a handful of specific locations in Kansas, Massachusetts and Nevada that are owned by the company or its customers, so it’s not like they’ll be flying over people unawares, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL9eRO"&gt;As you can see in the company’s video for the Scout system, it’s targeting this tech at companies that want push-button aerial inspections of their own property — not exactly drone deliveries. For that, the FAA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408646/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-clearance-approval-health-safety-alphabet-wing"&gt;a separate kind of certification&lt;/a&gt;. But the FAA does seem interested in what it can learn from letting American Robotics fly without humans physically nearby, as it explains in its justification for the waiver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hOJX1A"&gt;American Robotics’ proposed operations will provide the FAA with critical data for use in evaluating BVLOS operations from offsite locations. Once adopted on a wider scale, such a scheme could lend efficiencies to many of the industries that fuel our economy such as agriculture, transportation, mining, technology, and non-durable manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JrFzQ2"&gt;American Robotics previously had a beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) waiver from the FAA, but &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/part_107_waivers/waivers_issued/media/107W-2020-01574_Vijay_Somandepalli_CoW.pdf"&gt;that one (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; required its pilots to physically be at a location for the pre-flight inspections.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medium acquires eBook company Glose</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="medium" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2i3pACGytjT5vuZdNrD2a1kyys=/0x0:896x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676696/Medium.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ns6gDB"&gt;Medium &lt;a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-acquires-social-ebook-platform-glose-cf2e94485d8"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; its acquisition of the social-based ebook company Glose. Glose is a platform where users can buy and read books, then share notes and highlights with friends. In the press release announcing the acquisition, Medium CEO Ev Williams says that the company “look[s] forward to working with the Glose team on partnering with publishers to help authors reach more readers.” However, as &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/medium-acquires-glose-201755956.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;notes, once the integration is complete, Glose’s library “won’t be included in Medium’s $5 monthly and $50 annual subscriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWH6TU"&gt;What the integration between Glose and Medium will &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; look like is still a little unclear. In &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/media/medium-acquires-glose/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Glose CEO Nicolas Princen raises the idea of readers being able to jump from an article into a book. “The vision is to create an experience where you can go from one to the next,” he says. “You can read an article and then just one-click purchase a book that connects to that content if you want to go deeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1ZnmI"&gt;There are a few ways a Glose/Medium integration could go about this. I’d like to imagine that Medium could show me books written by the author of the article I’m reading. Going even further, Medium could also find books about the article’s subject and show those to readers who want to go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULbeOA"&gt;As an avid reader myself, both those ideas are intriguing, and I’d love to see how it works in practice. Ev Williams also talked to &lt;em&gt;CNN Business &lt;/em&gt;about making it easier to spin off a blog post from an inspiring book passage from Glose: “If I’m reading a book and some particular passage speaks to me, I can very seamlessly take that to my blog, maybe write about it, maybe have a discussion about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vk9Noi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If I’m reading a book and [a] passage speaks to me, I can very seamlessly take that to my blog.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ehpa4"&gt;While how much the acquisition cost Medium isn’t public, it does provide a revenue stream for the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15028310/medium-membership-subscriptions-launch"&gt;outside of its subscription service&lt;/a&gt;. While it may be a struggle to convince people to pay to read shorter-form articles, many people are already accustomed to paying for books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R40Ddh"&gt;However Medium decides to integrate with Glose, one thing is clear — the company wants to be a formidable force in online reading, and it has just added 1.5 million books to its library.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is blocking events near the White House through Inauguration Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Washington, DC Prepares For Potential Unrest Ahead Of Presidential Inauguration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DW1Gi8pr0W1cTuNnU1KKe0745sQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676476/1230589408.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sXevSu"&gt;Facebook won’t let people create events that take place “in close proximity” to the White House, the US Capitol building, or any state capitol buildings through Inauguration Day, the company announced &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. The move builds upon Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/"&gt;previously announced Inauguration Day preparations&lt;/a&gt; aiming to prevent the platform from being used to organize a violent event like the January 6th attack on the US Capitol.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nc7WPA"&gt;Facebook is also doing a “secondary review” of all inauguration-related events and will remove those that violate the platform’s rules. The company is also continuing a policy that blocks pages and accounts based outside the US from creating events located in the US. That policy was first put in place for the US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJXdSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has come under scrutiny for allowing posts promoting the January 6th riots to spread&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3fygS3"&gt;The company has come under scrutiny for allowing posts promoting and organizing the January 6th riots &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/"&gt;to spread across Facebook and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and for ads promoting military equipment that ran alongside content that contained election misinformation and calls for violence, according to &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-profits-military-gear-ads-capitol-riot"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said&lt;/a&gt; she believes the riots were “were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate,” the company is still stepping up enforcement of its policies and working to remove potentially dangerous content ahead of Inauguration Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bURPm8"&gt;Accounts that have repeatedly violated Facebook’s policies could be restricted. Those restrictions may include being blocked from creating live videos, events, groups, or pages, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2b1R9H"&gt;Facebook isn’t the only platform trying to prevent Inauguration Day gatherings. Airbnb is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;blocking and canceling&lt;/a&gt; all DC metro area reservations during inauguration week and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227028/airbnb-block-capitol-attackers-returning-dc-gofundme"&gt;banning people&lt;/a&gt; who were involved in the January 6th riots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gV7Hw9"&gt;In the days since that attack, many platforms have taken actions to try and prevent people from organizing another one. Facebook, for example, is now blocking the phrase “stop the steal.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have banned conservative-friendly social app Parler from their app stores, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon has terminated&lt;/a&gt; Parler’s hosting, effectively kicking it off the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is blocking Apple Silicon Mac users from sideloading iPhone apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot with an error message saying “Unable to install ‘PS App’ Please try again later”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-lRiTcoTbR5HI1lAsiVDeaN5Bs=/0x0:803x535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676278/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_2.19.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message in macOS 11.1.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Jay Peters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dCRz7v"&gt;Apple has turned off users’ ability to unofficially install iOS apps onto their M1 Macs (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-blocks-m1-mac-iphone-app-side-loading/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While iOS apps are still available in the Mac App Store, many apps, such as Dark Sky and Netflix, don’t have their developer’s approval to be run on macOS. Up until now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574207/how-to-install-run-any-iphone-ipad-app-m1-mac"&gt;there was a workaround&lt;/a&gt; that allowed the use of third-party software to install the apps without having to use the Mac App Store, but it seems like Apple has remotely disabled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bqtcld"&gt;When we tried to install an unsupported app on an M1 Mac running macOS 11.1, we got an error message saying that we couldn’t install it and should “try again later”. You can see a screenshot at the top of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xrOykf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mac users have been used to having more freedom in what programs they’re able to run&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnodcf"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;, the message on the most recent macOS 11.2 beta is more specific: “the application cannot be installed because the developer did not intend for it to run on this platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPy6vy"&gt;Apple moving to block the unauthorized app installs isn’t necessarily surprising. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/13/macos-beta-code-suggests-apple-will-block-users-from-sideloading-unsupported-ios-apps-on-m1-macs/"&gt;Code was found in the beta&lt;/a&gt; indicating a ban would be coming, and Apple has given developers power to block their apps from running on the Mac — a power that is undermined by sideloading. It is, however, sad to see the feature go, as Mac users have been used to having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167964/cydia-sues-apple-monopoly-anticompetitive-iphone"&gt;more freedom in what programs they’re able to run&lt;/a&gt; than they do on iOS (though Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intego.com%2Fmac-security-blog%2Fwhat-are-all-those-macos-catalina-security-alerts%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F15%2F22233754%2Fapple-blocking-m1-iphone-app-sideloading#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;control on the Mac has been tightening over the years&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhcXOw"&gt;We were able to run an app that we had already installed, but Apple is clearly cracking down on this behavior, so there's no guarantees that our already-sideloaded apps will work in the future either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly prototyping foldable iPhone screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwkeUq48UTT1T633jq3bPiSLRco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675881/vpavic_4243_20201018_0154.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4esEx0"&gt;Apple has started work on a foldable phone, and it’s begun prototyping foldable screens internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A final device is likely still years away, the report says, and Apple is working on just the display for now — not the rest of the phone it would attach to&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrPm9a"&gt;The initial prototypes sound similar to the foldable screens we’ve seen used by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and others. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says Apple is looking at making foldable screens with a “mostly invisible hinge” that could unfold to around the size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The report says that several screen sizes are being discussed, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9z7JXa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under-display Touch ID is reportedly still in testing for 2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSC7fl"&gt;Apple hasn’t publicly indicated any interest in making a foldable phone, though the company rarely signals its interest before entering a new product category. Major competitors have a head start on foldable devices, with Samsung and Motorola already releasing multiple generations of folding phones. Samsung’s Galaxy Fold came out in April 2019 (albeit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;with some substantial issues&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q61LiJ"&gt;On a more immediate note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;has some updates on Apple products coming in 2021. This year’s iPhone is expected to have “minor upgrades,” but one more substantial improvement is still a possibility: an in-screen fingerprint sensor. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;already said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-05/apple-working-on-in-display-fingerprint-id-for-future-iphones"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was looking into the feature for as early as 2020, and it’d be an obvious addition in 2021 since the wide adoption of face masks has seriously hindered the ability to use Face ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPtBM"&gt;It’s not clear how likely in-display Touch ID is to ship in 2021 (Apple tends to have iPhone features locked well in advance of production), but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says Apple is “still testing” the tech for inclusion this year. On a worse note, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also says that Apple has discussed removing the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging on “some” iPhone models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVN73K"&gt;Apple’s long-rumored Tile competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, are finally planned to launch this year, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports, and the iPad Pro could be refreshed with a Mini LED display. A thinner entry-level iPad is reportedly in the works as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n76LJk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision is an ode to sitcoms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3E66Y0hnhXvT6I9cOy_t75aSMA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675648/wvo0120_101_comp_v015_a_uhd_r709_e5c920dc.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YbJwF"&gt;When times are tough, the sitcom is a refuge. Like late-night talk shows, the multicamera sitcom is one of the oldest formats in television. It’s affordable and efficient for the people who produce it, and comforting and familiar to viewers. Problems are introduced and solved in 30 minutes or less, usually with the realization that they were never that big of a deal in the first place. Characters have signature tics and catchphrases we love them for; in time, they come to feel like our friends. The best of the bunch are syndicated long enough that we’re able to introduce them to our children. What a pleasant thing it is, to retreat into the uncomplicated pleasure of a sitcom — a half-hour white lie to tell ourselves whenever the real world feels like a little too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2glcWN"&gt;Perhaps this is why &lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;at least at the start, takes the form of a sitcom. The new series, which premiered its first two episodes on&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/976581/9358?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; today, is the first Marvel Cinematic Universe TV show made for Disney Plus. It’s also the first MCU project following 2019’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, arriving after a year without any new MCU installments. As a comeback, it’s an odd one: the first image you’re greeted with is two Avengers side characters inexplicably being reintroduced as a married couple in the theme song to a black-and-white ‘50s sitcom. They’re driving to their new home, she in a wedding dress, he in a dapper suit, delighted to start their idyllic life together. But something feels off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUvceS"&gt;The boldness of this play — and the way it is precisely the opposite of what we know Marvel movies to be — makes it a perfect return. It’ll be intriguing for super fans curious about what the point is and how it might connect to the larger franchise, and it will be intriguing to those who might feel a little burned out on superheroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrdHGy"&gt;Marvel projects are gilded genre lilies. They like to pay lip-service to one genre of entertainment — &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man &lt;/em&gt;has the cadence of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a heist movie, for example, and &lt;em&gt;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracy thriller — while they mostly serve as vehicles for generic action sequences. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, in at least its first two episodes, seems more sincere than that: the first episode plays its conceit of classic sitcom homage almost entirely straight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qraiDm"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/976581/9358?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents it, Wanda Maximoff and Vision are a married couple who have just moved into a well-to-do suburb. They’re trying to fit in while also hiding the fact that he’s a robot of sorts and she’s got superpowers. In the premiere, this manifests in a very &lt;em&gt;Bewitched&lt;/em&gt;-esque plot where Vision invites his boss home for dinner without telling Wanda. (She saves the day by using her powers to create an impressive meal without anyone noticing.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icaONi"&gt;Quietly, however, things get stranger. The ads in the show seem a little off. In the second episode, there’s an unremarked-upon time jump; the iconography of the ‘50s gives way to the fashion of the ‘60s. There’s &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;no allusion to Maximoff and Vision’s career as Avengers or anything they’ve been up to in previous Marvel movies. (The show does not mention that Vision, as far as we know, is dead — killed by Thanos at the end of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; and not brought back to life for &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hEtHV"&gt;Slowly, the fantasy starts to crumble. The characters joke about how Wanda and Vision do not have an anniversary or favorite song; and then, more overtly, the show offers glimpses behind the curtain to suggest that Wanda and Vision are being watched or that things that do not belong in this &lt;em&gt;Pleasantville&lt;/em&gt;-like setting are somehow seeping in. The comics-literate will tell you that there is a good reason for all of the mannered strangeness. The Wanda Maximoff of the comics literature has been known to manipulate reality, and it would make sense that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; might be building to that kind of revelation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ18QF"&gt;But no matter how and when &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/976581/9358?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;decides to explain itself, the comics lore of it all is only as good or interesting as the story it’s embedded in. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; works well enough without too much knowledge of the decade of films preceding it. Fundamentally, you’re watching a superhuman couple that’s seemingly trapped in a sitcom. It makes even more sense, however, when you recall these characters shared a moment of severe trauma the last time they were together. It makes you wonder if maybe this is where they want to be. Sitcoms are a great place to hide when the world gets to be a little too much.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: CES 2021 and Samsung’s S21 lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hLfGFJDTNd_ermUAIFYYoGsXQtA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675552/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uEzgjO"&gt;This year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces"&gt;Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt; was unsurprisingly all virtual. Typically, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is in the thick of it in Las Vegas, but this year, we’re all at our respective homes — so that means our podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9QLbR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, Monica Chin, and Chris Welch dive into all of the important announcements from both inside and outside of CES — including Samsung’s new flagship S21 smartphone line, the many new TVs with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;HDMI 2.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Mini LED&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;webOS&lt;/a&gt;, and the next laptops with new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;chips from Intel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLKhpr"&gt;There’s a whole lot more covered in this episode (as you can see from the links below), so listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple doesn’t make a MagSafe car charger — here are your options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2YypLOutr2SHxGrv2FW75FTcd5Y=/337x0:1537x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68675287/belkin_wic002_magnetic_vent_cable_management_product_page_v01_r01_1680x600_us.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XkfDkH"&gt;Getting a MagSafe car charger for your iPhone seems like a simple process, but the current landscape is one of trade-offs: there are no all-in-one solutions that will wirelessly hold and charge your phone &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are MagSafe certified to provide up to 15W of power. However, manufactures have been finding workarounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agS2QL"&gt;First, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-WIC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F15%2F22231718%2Fmagsafe-car-chargers-apple-iphone-certification-process#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin’s Car Vent Mount Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only MagSafe Certified car mount, and it sells for $39.99. Being certified doesn’t mean it provides power, though. You’ll have to plug your phone in with a Lightning cable (which you’d have to do anyway for wired CarPlay compatibility). This does technically let you charge your phone faster than regular wireless charging, but it leaves you messing around with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8tH9D"&gt;Then there’s &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/14/scosche-magsafe-magicmount-series-brings-magsafe-charging-to-your-car"&gt;the Scosche MagicMount&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a 20W car adapter but nothing to plug into it. You have to provide your own MagSafe puck, which adds $39 to the MagicMount’s $29.99 to $39.99 price tag (which varies by model). While it does technically get you MagSafe-certified mounting and charging, that’s only because you’re using Apple’s own puck. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1A3jkGPVnNX0cQqFQinjlAXv-6c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22238391/Screen_Shot_2021_01_15_at_10.16.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re fine with just using an official MagSafe puck, you will be spoiled for choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CfxoE7"&gt;Just providing the plastic to put around Apple’s charger is a common approach. Amazon is full of the BYOP (bring your own puck) car mounts, and we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3300477/elago-w3-macintosh-apple-watch-charging-stand-sale-on-amazon.html"&gt;also seen it with Apple Watch charger accessories&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a quick and easy way to get users the fully certified experience without having to wait for certification (and without Apple’s Made For iPhone program fees). The downside is that users have to buy two different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh2PCV"&gt;Finally, there’s &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/26/review-esr-halolock-is-everything-a-magsafe-car-charger-should-be"&gt;the ESR HaloLock&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to have it all. It’s one piece, magnetically holds your iPhone, and provides wireless charging. The only thing missing is MagSafe certification, meaning Apple will only let your phone charge at 7.5W. You’ll again see a lot of similar products on Amazon, where the manufacturer has copied MagSafe’s magnets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215639/anker-magsafe-qi-charger-apple-alternative-giant-usb-c-plug-explained"&gt;used a standard Qi charger for power&lt;/a&gt;. Like the puck holders, you’ll get most of the functionality without actually having to be certified, and the product will be fine for people who aren’t worried about fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cV4d0"&gt;This isn’t to say that third-party, fully certified MagSafe car mounts won’t show up at some point, just that it may take a little while. And given the other routes get you pretty close to the real deal, you can expect to see a lot of those in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WarnerMedia extends its 20 percent discount on HBO Max subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vaxg3vCzbZGKNaPQgOXHkOpl2cw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68674938/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVLkDb"&gt;A discount on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21272223/hbo-max-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; that was supposed to end today, January 15th, has been extended until March 1st, 2021. The fine print of the offer hasn’t changed: you can get six months of HBO Max for 20 percent off the normal total cost, which is usually $90 before tax. &lt;a href="https://www.hbomax.com/"&gt;You’ll pay $70 with this deal&lt;/a&gt; (it’s like paying just under $12 per month instead of $15), but the catch is that you have to prepay in full and it’s nonrefundable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOq3Hq"&gt;This discount is open to both new and returning HBO Max subscribers, but it can’t be stacked with a free trial or any other promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhmXqS"&gt;WarnerMedia kicked off this deal in early December 2020 on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros. announcing that its 2021 slate of films would debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; alongside the theatrical releases and remain available to stream for 30 days. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; was the first of its films to launch, and you have a few more weeks to catch that one before it’s a theater-exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWTeW3"&gt;It has several more movies expected to launch throughout the year, including &lt;em&gt;The Little Things, Judas and the Black Messiah, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Those Who Wish Me Dead, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, In The Heights, Space Jam: A New Legacy, The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Reminiscence, Malignant, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, The Many Saints of Newark, King Richard, Cry Macho, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
