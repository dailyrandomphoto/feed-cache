    <title>Q Link Wireless made private customer information accessible with just a phone number</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5GNoTZ"&gt;A mobile carrier allowed anyone with one of its customers phone numbers to access their personal information, including name, address, phone number, and text and call history, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/04/no-password-required-mobile-carrier-exposes-data-for-millions-of-accounts/?comments=1"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The carrier, Q Link Wireless, &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/south-florida-based-hello-mobile-beats-nationwide-prepaid-prices-1028340029"&gt;claimed to have over two million customers&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETd9uD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/mkolj5/critical_security_issue_with_hellomobile_account/"&gt;noted a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; saying that the app used by the carrier and its subsidiary Hello Mobile never asked for a password or any identifying information when the user was logging on with a phone number. Looking &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-mobile-account/id1408895511"&gt;through the reviews&lt;/a&gt;, there are references to the poor security practices (to put it mildly) going back to December of 2020. While it’s unclear when the credential-less login system appeared, there is an update note from two years ago that mentions an “updated login process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apWHAE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A ton of information was available in the app, which didn’t ask for a password&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKaEKS"&gt;The carrier has reportedly fixed the issue — though &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/mkolj5/critical_security_issue_with_hellomobile_account/gty65gj?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;it seems it may have done so&lt;/a&gt; by just turning off logins to the app altogether. Before the change, &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; was able to see, but not change, a bevy of information from a Hello Mobile customer who volunteered their phone number, including their name, address, account number, email address, and which numbers they’d contacted or been contacted by. The last one is probably the most sensitive — while the contents of texts or phone calls weren’t shown, there’s still a lot of information that can be gleaned from knowing who you talked to and when you talked to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J98r4"&gt;The app’s description mentions that it allows users to add more minutes or data to their plans, but it’s unclear if that required extra authentication. Regardless, there’s still a ton of information that was available to anyone able to get the phone number of one of Q Link Wireless’ customers. Reportedly, Q Link Wireless hasn’t notified its customers that their information had been accessible — which seems to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374464/linkedin-data-leak-500-million-accounts-scraped-microsoft"&gt;a worrying trend&lt;/a&gt; among companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372707/facebook-responds-533-million-data-leak-notify-users"&gt;that leak user data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmEFee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; found no evidence that the security vulnerability was widely exploited, but having to worry about others having access to a ton of their sensitive data isn’t something that anyone needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET8OCR"&gt;Q Link Wireless didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox will no longer support Amazon’s Fire TV or Echo Show devices on April 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uI4m1Zg2ilRzrQCjM1nRH9TK_v8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69104734/dseifert_210219_4433_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9L8qV"&gt;Firefox will no longer support Amazon Fire TV or Echo Show devices starting April 30th, Mozilla announced on Friday (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/09/firefox-is-ending-support-for-amazon-fire-tv-and-echo-show-devices/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4n3pmQ"&gt;“You will no longer be able to install [Firefox] on FireTV, receive security updates, or be able to reinstall the app if you uninstall it starting on April 30, 2021,” &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-support-firefox-amazon-devices"&gt;Mozilla said in a support document&lt;/a&gt;. “If you have Firefox set as your default browser on Echo Show, you will be redirected to Amazon Silk for web browsing starting April 30, 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdc5Lz"&gt;Mozilla first brought Firefox to Fire TV devices in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16801908/mozilla-firefox-amazon-fire-tv-app-google-youtube-feud"&gt;December 2017&lt;/a&gt;, giving Fire TV owners a way to watch YouTube in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices"&gt;a bitter feud between Google and Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. In July 2019, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"&gt;Google brought the YouTube app back to the Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;, giving users one less reason to use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7TPq1"&gt;The Mozilla-made browser first came to Echo Show devices alongside Amazon’s Silk browser with the introduction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/20/17883456/amazon-new-echo-show-2018-screen-features-price-fabric"&gt;Echo Show 10 in September 2018&lt;/a&gt;. There’s still no YouTube app for Echo Show, so the two browsers have offered a way to watch YouTube on the Amazon-made smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvfWdV"&gt;Mozilla now suggests using Silk to browse the web on Fire TV and Echo show devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lil Nas X released a Montero lo-fi remix to help you study for your Demonology test </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RRssDjlhrMOz7tV4lIEf54TFTc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69104169/Screen_Shot_2021_04_09_at_2.31.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lil Nas X&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mqeGBQ"&gt;In the latest virtuoso move to promote his hit song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name),” Lil Nas X posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgh-zQJICbU"&gt;a lo-fi remix of the track to YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; Friday evening. According to his Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1380526435782127620"&gt;it’s his birthday&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems he has given us all this gift in celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPO9Al"&gt;The video, which has the full title “Lil Nas X - MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) but it’s lofi and something you can study to lol,” is honestly perfect. It sounds &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like something you’d hear on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow"&gt;Lofi Girl’s channel&lt;/a&gt;; if it ever gets slipped into the rotation on the channel’s iconic “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to&lt;/a&gt;” video, I wouldn’t bat an eye (ear?). Lil Nas X’s video even has five anime drawings of iconic looks from the rapper, clearly taking inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/11/22325348/youtooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine"&gt;famous anime girl&lt;/a&gt; that is the face of the Lofi Girl channel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWEbHs"&gt;This genius lo-fi remix idea isn’t Lil Nas X’s first clever adaptation of the song that he’s posted to YouTube. At the end of March, he shared “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/54KlB1Fp9Ww"&gt;MONTERO but ur in the bathroom of hell while lil nas is giving satan a lap dance in the other room&lt;/a&gt;,” which is just as excellent as the lo-fi remix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WVnhfC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54KlB1Fp9Ww?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q08e9"&gt;There’s also “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dPp1HUKNXio"&gt;Lil Nas X - MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) [But Lil Nas X Is Silent The Entire Time]&lt;/a&gt;,” if you’re looking for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rUVkpC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPp1HUKNXio?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GntfI5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSkRRT"&gt;Lil Nas X also released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372657/lil-nas-x-twerk-hero-montero-call-me-by-your-name-browser-free-game"&gt;browser-based twerking game&lt;/a&gt; and partnered with MSCHF to release Satan Shoes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;that Nike sued over&lt;/a&gt;. (Nike and MSCHF announced on Thursday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374480/nike-mschf-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-lawsuit-settled"&gt;they had settled&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPbN3P"&gt;Just give this man all the Grammys already, we don’t even need to host the awards next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uoMoRc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lil Nas X’s ‘Twerk Hero’ is a real game where you shake a virtual butt to Montero","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372657/lil-nas-x-twerk-hero-montero-call-me-by-your-name-browser-free-game"},{"title":"Nike and MSCHF settle Satan Shoe lawsuit, say any ‘confused’ buyers can get a refund","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374480/nike-mschf-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-lawsuit-settled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Hasbro’s new $700 Optimus Prime toy can finally transform all on its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WGZ9cBRCQEZ2-62CNRS3PaS5Jc=/64x0:577x342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103928/Apr_09_2021_17_13_10.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgSpxM"&gt;Transformers are some of the most iconic toys around — an action figure &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a car! All in one! A true bargain! But as modern &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; toys have gotten more complex, they have also become an &lt;a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/think-transformers-toys-have-become-too-complicated-blame-michael-bay"&gt;absolutely huge pain&lt;/a&gt; to actually transform from car to robot and back again, often requiring multiple shame-filled trips back to the trashcan where you threw it in a fit of hubris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeiqbQ"&gt;Hasbro is finally fixing that problem. Not by making the toys simpler, but by making them a lot more complicated &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; expensive in the form of its &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/transformers-optimus-prime-auto-converting-programmable-advanced-robot-collectors-edition"&gt;new $700 Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Advanced Robot&lt;/a&gt;, which thanks to the power of real robotics technology (in the form of 27 servo motors and a mobile app) can actually transform all by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMJDnP"&gt;The new Transformer is almost breathtaking in its complexity: Hasbro says that the 19-inch figure features roughly 5,000 components, 27 patented servo motors, and 60 connected microchips in order to pull off the automated transforming feature. In addition to a mobile app, the new Optimus Prime toy also features voice commands that allow owners to control the transforming action or drive around the vehicle form by shouting things like “roll out” or “convert.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06Fjsls8EqMOXsKArRIFeM1nrQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433527/Screen_Shot_2021_04_09_at_5.15.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Imaa6N"&gt;The downside of owning the first Transformer that can actually, y’know, transform on its own is the eye-watering price — for $700, the new Optimus Prime toy had better be able to fight off actual Decepticons to save the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkloSO"&gt;The new model is being built in partnership with Robosen Robotics, which, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22361383/optimus-prime-robot-toy-transformers-hasbro-robosen-robotics"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has been making suspiciously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5sPgeEEXRs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt;-looking motorized robots&lt;/a&gt; for years. The  new collaboration with Hasbro, though, gives Robosen the chance to bring its skills to an official Transformer product instead of a look-alike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDqw7h"&gt;The Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Advanced Robot is available to preorder now from the Hasbro Pulse website for $699.99. Orders are expected to ship on August 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DuckDuckGo promises to block Google’s latest ad-tracking tech — if Google allows it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L_2IT52stOdEcY77jm6-7hNTtu0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103512/acastro_200218_3900_StoryStream_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4vZW73"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/google-testing-its-controversial-new-ad-targeting-tech-millions-browsers-heres"&gt;just starting to test&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;replacement for third-party cookies&lt;/a&gt;, but DuckDuckGo is &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/block-floc-with-duckduckgo/"&gt;already announcing that it wants to block that tech&lt;/a&gt; with its Chrome extension. Google’s FLoC, or Federated Learning of Cohorts, technology is designed to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;more privacy-centered way&lt;/a&gt; to track users and serve ads to them, but some privacy advocates, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"&gt;claimed that it could be harmful to consumers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CJvSo"&gt;We have a great explainer on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;what FLoC is&lt;/a&gt; for those who want to go in-depth, but the overview is that the tech works to sort users into groups based on their behavior. Advertisers can then target those groups instead of individual people. Privacy advocates argue that, while it’s better than the third-party cookie situation, FLoC IDs could still be bad for consumers, containing potentially sensitive information as well as providing another data point that lets advertisers individually identify you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgN3rz"&gt;DuckDuckGo says that it agrees with those concerns &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/block-floc-with-duckduckgo/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; where it also announced that the latest version of its Chrome extension would prevent websites from tracking users via their FLoC identification. Of course, the company notes that the extension update will have to be approved by Google before it becomes available to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk7RS9"&gt;In addition to the extension update, DuckDuckGo says its search engine will opt out of collecting FLoC IDs and using them to identify or advertise to users, regardless of whether you’re using its Chrome extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irGph8"&gt;The stance isn’t surprising for a Google competitor, especially one that uses privacy as one of its main selling points. However, it does speak to the idea that FLoC will not be universally accepted — like with third-party tracking cookies before it, FLoC may be destined to become part of an arms race between advertisers and users who don’t want to be tracked. The technology isn’t even out of the testing phase yet, and other companies are already looking to block it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee leaders are demanding that Apple provide a witness for an upcoming hearing on app stores and digital competition after the iPhone manufacturer has refused to participate, according to a new letter to the company released Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imbRdT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter addressed&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) say the company “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for an April hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RT3z2o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8h7rdt"&gt;“Apple has been aware for weeks that the Subcommittee was planning a hearing on this topic and was engaged in discussions with our staff regarding who would testify on Apple’s behalf,” the senators wrote to Apple Friday. “Yet a little more than two weeks [16 days] before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness to testify at a hearing in April.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhNpZ6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple’s App Store practices have been under intense scrutiny by lawmakers over the last year. In 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched an investigation into competition in the tech industry, including Apple’s App Store. Throughout the probe, lawmakers homed in on the 30 percent fees Apple charges app developers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;interview last June&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) called the practice “highway robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;The criticism extends to the app developers themselves. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games sued Apple last year, accusing the company of violating US antitrust laws after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;removed the popular battle royale&lt;/a&gt; game from the App Store. The trial is set to begin on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elx5N3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More than 500 Alphabet employees demand Google stop protecting harassers in open letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Id-bScn28UEQrENSKTZFM-EueKQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103201/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y5bfqu"&gt;More than 500 Alphabet employees have signed an &lt;a href="https://stopprotectingharassers.medium.com/alphabet-stop-protecting-harassers-d32a17aa5762"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; demanding Google stop protecting the subjects of harassment complaints. The move comes two days after former Google engineer Emi Nietfeld &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html"&gt;wrote an op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alleging that she was forced to have one-on-one meetings with the man who harassed her — and sit next to him in the office — even after she filed an HR complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61d6"&gt;“This is a long pattern where Alphabet protects the harasser instead of protecting the person harmed by the harassment,” the letter reads. “The person who reports harassment is forced to bear the burden, usually leaving Alphabet while their harasser stays or is rewarded for their behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kosmJq"&gt;Workers lay out two demands in the letter. First, that Google strip harassers of their direct reports, ensuring that “no harasser should manage or lead a team.” Second, that they force harassers to change teams if the claims are verified so employees don’t have to work alongside their harasser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8osStJ"&gt;“I’m heartened to see this letter,” Nietfeld said in a phone interview with&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It reminds me of how great some of my former colleagues were and why I loved working with them. Google hires so many people who are passionate about doing the right thing. It’s such a shame when the system prevents them from doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQhIPB"&gt;Andrew Gainer-Dewar, a Google software engineer and member of the Alphabet Workers Union, says Nietfeld’s experience underlines the need for collective action. “Surely someone who has been credibly accused of harassment shouldn’t be managing people,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And someone who has been &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; to have harassed people definitely shouldn’t be managing people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEMDgG"&gt;Nietfeld’s story highlights concerns raised by Google employees in 2018 in the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;aftermath of the Andy Rubin scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Rubin, who co-founded Android, was paid $90 million despite being credibly accused of sexual misconduct. When these allegations came to light, 20,000 Google employees walked out to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRUDwz"&gt;One of the demands from walkout organizers was an end to the forced arbitration clause in Google contracts. While Google removed the clause for employees, it did not remove it for contractors or workers at other Alphabet companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co0s0v"&gt;The letter directly calls out this omission. “Alphabet has not changed, and did not meet any of the Google Walkout demands (temps, vendors, contractors, and workers from Alphabet companies other than Google are still forced into arbitration),” the letter says. “We’ve already raised these issues before. The Google Walkout demands are still waiting to be met!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Gyjn"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson emphasized that the company has changed its handling of harassment claims since the walkout took place. “We’ve made significant improvements to our overall process, including the way we handle and investigate employee concerns, and introducing new care programs for employees who report concerns,” a spokesperson said. “Reporting misconduct takes courage and we’ll continue our work to improve our processes and support for the people who do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISGAc2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfJKCq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s big podcasting move is creating shows to promote TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpownqYEXeHyOwgMrsJ06wAczEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103100/VRG_ILLO_4520_Apple_Podcast_TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEJw9o"&gt;The podcasting world’s been waiting and watching for Apple to debut a full-blown revenue-producing podcast business. Spotify and other tech giants have been making moves in the space — signing exclusivity deals, acquiring companies, and generally trying to dominate the market. Yet, Apple has stayed mostly quiet, despite operating one of, if not the most, popular podcast apps on the market. Recently, however, it’s started to dabble in creating its own shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbGlxd"&gt;This week, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Foriginals%2Fthe-line%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F9%2F22375738%2Fapple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;premiered&lt;/a&gt; a new investigative nonfiction podcast looking at US Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was charged with committing war crimes. The show, called &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, serves as a complementary but separately reported program to a forthcoming Apple TV Plus show of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfOM7u"&gt;Anyone hoping this might signal Apple’s broader interest in building its own podcast content was likely disappointed. Although &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt; represents a step toward Apple creating its own shows, it doesn’t dive the company head-first into the podcasting waters. Instead, the company’s dipping its toes in, relying on podcasts to promote its subscription programming rather than using podcasts as a moneymaker themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2eQLJX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s original podcast endeavors serve as marketing for its other revenue-making businesses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqP0xb"&gt;Apple’s strategy continues to grow around these companion shows. Earlier this year, it premiered &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast to complement its TV show of the same name, and it created a companion show for the Oprah Book Club in partnership with Apple Books. It also plans to launch a show in coordination with the premiere of &lt;em&gt;The Problem With Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, another Apple TV Plus series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;coming this fall&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of a full-throated proclamation that Apple wants to build a business around podcasting, we’re instead seeing Apple use audio to push podcast listeners toward its moneymaking subscription service TV Plus, as well as its a la carte book-selling app Books. Basically, Apple is playing it safe and avoiding a full commitment to podcasting, which, as of right now, doesn’t make it money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbtwx"&gt;These companion podcasts instead serve as a marketing tool to capture potential audiences in new places. Maybe some dedicated podcast listeners missed Apple’s promotional push for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, but instead spotted the program in a show carousel on the main Apple Podcasts page. If they listen, they then might want to subscribe to TV Plus for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;’s streaming premiere, and Apple gains a $4.99-per-month subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrZOfX"&gt;This doesn’t mean Apple won’t eventually build a way to make money off podcasting. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify"&gt;been rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be getting into the podcast game more deeply and is reportedly working on a paid podcast feature. Currently, however, Apple doesn’t support any sort of revenue-producing functionality in its podcast app, like tipping, subscriptions, or exclusive content gating. For comparison, Spotify, Apple’s biggest player competitor, is testing subscription Anchor podcasts and offers a premium subscription tier. It also sells ads against its own podcasts and inserts additional ads into free users’ streams, giving the company a number of ways to profit off shows. Apple will likely never look to advertising as its main revenue driver for podcasting. The company’s taken a firm stance on user privacy, and targeting podcast ads would cross that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HeyMBX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting podcast listeners to subscribe to TV Plus could give Apple a user boost&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEJDGm"&gt;It could, however, start charging for podcast content or, instead of launching a podcast in coordination with an already created TV Plus show, use its original podcasts as a launching pad for future series. If a show does well as a podcast, Apple itself could greenlight the idea into a TV production, further driving revenue. This is already a podcasting business strategy. Shows like &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; started out as successful podcasts that were then turned into video programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFakrn"&gt;Other video streaming companies have pulled from a similar podcasting playbook. &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/podcasts"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://netflixeditorial.com/channels/netflix-podcasts/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; both create companion content for their shows, which not only encourages viewers to spend more time with the company’s programming, but also reaches a different audience, one that might be enticed to subscribe just because of what they heard on a podcast. The difference between those companies and Apple is their lack of podcasting infrastructure. They don’t have a player themselves, so there’s less opportunity to build a business around original shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rExaAP"&gt;Apple has multiple one-ups on these other streaming services. It already owns the space where a large portion of people listen to podcasts, and it offers a variety of content subscriptions for games, TV shows, fitness, and more, including a bundle. Building the technology to support paid podcasts is one of the last steps to structure the business — it’s that and believing podcasting could actually become a real revenue driver all on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Top Gun: Maverick is the latest major blockbuster to skip the summer movie season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00vfOfgeJi9E0EEVW9wu1FOQwf8=/151x0:1344x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102933/Screen_Shot_2021_04_09_at_11.23.25_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkBtky"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to the ’80s classic &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; starring Tom Cruise, will now premiere on November 19th, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/top-gun-maverick-mission-impossible-7-tom-cruise-release-date-change-july-4th-weekend-memorial-day-weekend-1234730581/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was previously slated to open on July 2nd — which itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336869/a-quiet-place-part-2-top-gun-maverick-delayed-coronavirus-covid-19-2021"&gt;was a delay&lt;/a&gt; from December 23rd, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmsJVs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maverick’s&lt;/em&gt; delay is the latest shift in this summer’s movie slate, which, like last summer’s, has been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;Disney delayed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;from a May release date to July 9th and is also opting to make it available as a $30 Disney Plus Premier Access title the same day. The company also made Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; a Disney Plus exclusive and said &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; will be a Disney Plus Premier Access release when it hits theaters on May 28th. MGM delayed &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;, the next James Bond movie, from April 2nd &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/no-time-to-die-release-date-delay-james-bond-1234883484/"&gt;to October 8th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krTaTE"&gt;Universal Pictures also shifted the highly anticipated &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/f9-release-date-postponed-summer-1234883492/"&gt;Memorial Day weekend to June 25th&lt;/a&gt;, which would make it the first major blockbuster to exclusively release in theaters since Christopher Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; last fall — assuming Universal doesn’t follow its competition and delay the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/em&gt; film again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqzNC9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; sequel’s delay has cascading effects on the rest of Paramount Pictures’ movie lineup. Two other movies starring Cruise have been bumped: &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt; is now debuting on May 27th, 2022, instead of this November, while &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 8&lt;/em&gt; has moved from a November 2022 release to July 7th, 2023, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; has also been delayed, moving to a March 3rd, 2023, debut. Paramount’s announcement also referenced an as-yet unrevealed &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; film — which &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-next-star-trek-movie-has-a-stardate-in-2023-1846652498"&gt;&lt;em&gt;io9&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; is a secret, J.J. Abrams-produced project — set to hit theaters on June 9th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA seeks to put first person of color on the Moon in Artemis mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRn0roG1HDeVBsbiT3wyCswKK1g=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102884/GSFC_20171208_Archive_e001861_orig.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Acting NASA administrator Steve Jurczyk said Friday that under President Biden’s budget request, the agency’s Artemis mission has a new goal: in addition to landing the first woman on the Moon, it will also send the first person of color to the lunar surface. So far, the only Earthlings to touch the Moon’s surface have been white men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfgyZF"&gt;“The president’s discretionary request increases NASA’s ability to better understand Earth and further monitor and predict the impacts of climate change,” &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/acting-nasa-administrator-statement-on-agency-fy-2022-discretionary-request"&gt;Jurczyk said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It also gives us the necessary resources to continue advancing America’s bipartisan Moon to Mars space exploration plan, including landing the first woman and first person of color on the Moon under the Artemis program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8nuxGH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BC5khqpKovU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RgXVWL"&gt;Biden’s 2022 budget request includes $24.7 billion for NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z51NCU"&gt;NASA previously announced that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18622415/nasa-moon-return-first-woman-astronaut-artemis-program"&gt;Artemis mission&lt;/a&gt;, named for the Greek Moon goddess and twin sister of the god Apollo, would put a woman on the Moon’s surface by 2024. Last November, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166077/nasa-artemis-astronauts-18-first-woman-moon-mike-pence-space-council"&gt;introduced the 18 astronauts&lt;/a&gt; who will staff the Artemis mission. The group includes several people of color and nine women. It’s not yet known who the first woman or person of color on the Moon will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T0Seg"&gt;The Space Launch System — the giant rocket the space agency plans to use to send people to the Moon — has its first uncrewed flight scheduled for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
