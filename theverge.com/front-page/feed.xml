    <title>Qualcomm announces its next-gen X65 5G modem, promises up to 10Gbps speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0gcGiN_D2rmhbvhXuESDhoerjkM=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791691/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwCuoi"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest 5G modem — the Snapdragon X65, a successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;last year’s Snapdragon X60&lt;/a&gt; which just started to hit devices as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888 chipset&lt;/a&gt;. Qualcomm promises that the new modem will be much, much faster, with support for up to 10Gbps speeds on both standalone and non-standalone 5G networks (assuming your carrier supports it, that is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJloCB"&gt;It’ll likely be some time before the X65 hits any devices; if history is any indication, it likely won’t show up until next year’s flagship Snapdragon release, which presumably will be announced in December. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgacAGS2NYapFaHGr_9_eTHgf3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291692/Qualcomm_Snapdragon_X65_5G_Modem_RF_System_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j4hT38"&gt;The new 10Gbps maximum download speed — up from 7.5Gbps on last year’s model — is the flashiest spec, even if its a largely meaningless one, as virtually no 5G network can provide that kind of throughput yet. But it means that there’s plenty of headroom in the specification for networks for whenever they can get to that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk8c3r"&gt;That flexibility for future improvements is at the heart of one of the other big features of the X65: support for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.3gpp.org/release-16"&gt;3GPP Release 16 specification&lt;/a&gt; (Qualcomm says that it’s the first modem to do so). That’s the so-called “5G phase 2” rollout that’s &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/07/07/propelling-5g-forward-closer-look-3gpp-release-16"&gt;designed to improve things&lt;/a&gt; like massive MIMO connectivity, power consumption, and more. Release 16 is also meant to help 5G networks expand from consumer to more commercial uses, thanks to better support for unlicensed spectrum and non-public networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evu5Yy"&gt;To that end, Qualcomm says that the architecture of the X65 modem system is upgradable, allowing the company to add new features over time, especially as 3GPP Release 16 continues to roll out, allowing devices to stay relevant and up to date for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDaM9j"&gt;Along with the new modem system, Qualcomm is also announcing the Qualcomm 545 mmWave antenna, its 4th-generation mmWave antenna, which keeps the size the same as the third-generation model, but adds higher transmit power, along with support for the full range of global mmWave frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQTRrHbolAKMfxEw4U2oEDKYITE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291694/Qualcomm_QTM547_mmWave_antenna_module.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dbm352"&gt;Lastly, Qualcomm is introducing what its calls “AI antenna tuning technology,” which it promises will enable big jumps in performance thanks to AI-powered tuning. For example, Qualcomm says that the new system is 30 percent more accurate at detecting how you’re gripping the phone in your hand, allowing it to offer improved connectivity, faster data speeds, and better battery life by utilizing a more efficient connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXg72T"&gt;The Snapdragon X65 is expected to launch in products in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyzhDo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9KqYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mw6gZY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIKbTX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy e-bikes now navigate you around air pollution</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CSSHWApmkvtL70cqOW1fLhiOVI=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791638/verge-DSC_4815__1_-2040pxl.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MeQeLk"&gt;Belgian e-bike maker Cowboy has delivered on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;its promise&lt;/a&gt; to help riders avoid pollution on their commutes with a new air quality navigation feature in the company’s latest &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cowboy-electric-bikes/id1262900539"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bike.cowboy.app&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; apps. Owners now have the option to pick the quickest or healthiest routes to their destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnS6rz"&gt;The feature is enabled by the integration of air quality data from a company called Breezometer, with a claimed data resolution of &lt;a href="https://blog.breezometer.com/how-did-we-get-to-our-5-meter-air-quality-data-resolution"&gt;5-meters (about 16 feet)&lt;/a&gt;. That’s specific enough to help riders navigate around polluted routes in densely constructed cities like Amsterdam, as demonstrated in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikL3mk"&gt;Breezometer’s ability to measure air quality with such granularity involves some guesswork since it doesn’t have physical sensors distributed at 5-meter intervals around the globe. Encouragingly, Breezometer’s claims are backed by chief scientist, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdr-gabriela-adler-katz%2F%3ForiginalSubdomain%3Dil&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F9%2F22274100%2Fcowboy-e-bike-breezometer-air-pollution-navigation#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Gabriela Katz&lt;/a&gt;, who was previously at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1if8RZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An educated guess&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qac0nX"&gt;Breezometer’s model starts with measured data from more than 47,000 sensors worldwide. It then weaves in additional data like live traffic, satellite imagery, smoke, wind, and weather using custom algorithms and machine learning techniques. Notably, Breezometer says that it measures air pollution emitted by “10 million traffic jam sections around the world” every 12 minutes for over 30,000 cities worldwide. The company then subjects its air quality measurements to a quality assurance process before reporting to &lt;a href="https://breezometer.com/accurate-realtime-air-quality-data"&gt;ensure accuracy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGHQRn"&gt;It certainly makes sense for Cowboy to incorporate an air pollution model that leans heavily on car traffic. After all, if you’ve ever bicycled alongside a traffic jam then your lungs and eyeballs are acutely aware of the hyperlocal pollution created by a hoard of idling combustion engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghF3pn"&gt;And it’s not like traditional air quality indexes like those used by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are without issues. “The government network of 3,900 monitoring devices nationwide has routinely missed major toxic releases and day-to-day pollution dangers,” said &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pollution-airmonitors-specialreport/u-s-air-monitors-routinely-miss-pollution-even-refinery-explosions-idUSKBN28B4RT"&gt;a damning &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; just two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L3SPU"&gt;So yeah, Cowboy’s new air quality navigation feature is a guess, but at least it’s an educated one that could benefit your heart and lungs over the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit to double employees after raising $250 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hfmSMx82iGoWQBepVKOsChqhqeE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791530/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6gu0c"&gt;Reddit will double the number of employees it has over the course of this year to around 1,400 after raising $250 million in a new funding round, the &lt;a href="https://redditblog.com/2021/02/08/fueling-reddits-future/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Reddit currently has around 700 employees globally. Over 600 are based in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/reddit-wont-cut-pay-for-workers-who-leave-san-francisco-new-york.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;where it has offices in San Francisco, New York, LA, and Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPDlk3"&gt;The announcement of the new funding round comes as the site’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;r/WallStreetBets subreddit gained widespread attention&lt;/a&gt; for its role in increasing the share prices of GameStop, AMC, and other companies. Redditors organized to purchase shares in certain companies en-masse, turbocharging their stock prices at the expense of short-selling hedge funds. As of last week the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264960/sec-gamestop-amc-probe-fraudulent-social-media-posts"&gt;Securities and Exchange commission is reportedly investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether misinformation posted on social media could have violated securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KZtY8e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reddit recently acquired Dubsmash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bMEkNc"&gt;Reddit CEO Steve Huffman &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-valuation-doubles-to-6-billion-after-funding-round-11612833205"&gt;tells &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the company isn’t planning on “materially changing” its strategy as a result of the funding round. The company says it plans to use the money to invest in video, advertising, consumer products, and international expansion. On Sunday, Reddit said that it spent its entire marketing budget on a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271797/reddit-super-bowl-ad-five-seconds-gamestop"&gt;5-second Super Bowl ad&lt;/a&gt; celebrating its role in the GameStop stocks saga. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173774/reddit-acquires-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-short-form-video-tools"&gt;Reddit acquired Dubsmash&lt;/a&gt;, a “short-form video social platform” whose video creation tools it plans to integrate into its own platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OayifM"&gt;Reddit’s valuation doubled to $6 billion as a result of the new funding, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. Last quarter, the company’s direct advertising revenue was up 90 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, Reddit says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rrxjju"&gt;As of December, Reddit boasted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754984/reddit-dau-daily-users-revealed"&gt;52 million daily active users&lt;/a&gt;, For comparison, Facebook has around 1.85 billion daily users, Snapchat’s parent company Snap has 265 million daily active users, and Twitter recent said it averages 187 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6vt1k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeQSdS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus co-founder’s Nothing company will release wireless earbuds this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lQ2ZzuoH-vjOodvyH0puAvjacT0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791506/Nothing_RGB_Signalweiss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q43RQP"&gt;Nothing, the new venture from ex-OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, plans to release a pair of wireless earbuds this summer, with other products following later in the year, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/alphabet-s-vc-arm-backs-oneplus-co-founder-s-nothing-company?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview, Pei said Nothing plans to eventually produce an ecosystem of devices that can connect to one another. The product details were revealed with the announcement that Nothing has completed a new $15 million funding round led by Alphabet’s venture capital unit, GV (formerly Google Ventures). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elrGv8"&gt;Manufacturing wireless headphones would bring Nothing into competition with some of the world’s biggest tech companies including Apple, Samsung, and Sony. Notably, Nothing would also be competing with Pei’s old company, OnePlus, which released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21331910/oneplus-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-price-design-sound"&gt;first pair of true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519785/oneplus-carl-pei-departure"&gt;Pei left OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tw0th"&gt;Carl Pei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;formally announced Nothing late last month&lt;/a&gt;. Describing itself as a “London based consumer technology company,” Nothing has already attracted investment from iPod inventor Tony Fadell, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, and YouTuber Casey Neistat. For more about Pei’s vision for Nothing, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;interview from last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This may be our first look at Google’s new Android 12 OS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9JgljBm-qeNoMZCawo3e5NAAyo=/0x22:2036x1379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791441/android12conversationswidget.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 rumored UI and features.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: XDA-Developers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OhD82S"&gt;A series of leaked images may offer a first look at Google’s Android 12 update. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-first-look-screenshots/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; has published&lt;/a&gt; screenshots from what is said to be from an “early draft” of documents Google distributes to Android partners. The screenshots, which &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; says haven’t been fully confirmed, include what appears to be new UI changes, alongside a new privacy indicator and conversation widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDiBvM"&gt;If accurate, the UI changes include an emphasis on rounded corners, with a reduction in the number of Quick Settings available from the unexpanded notification panel. Google also appears to be using a beige color scheme, which could be part of the rumored &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/28/android-12-may-offer-a-system-wide-color-theming-feature/"&gt;new native theme system&lt;/a&gt; for Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/irXehrqcajlEORpCr7Pcm-DTFsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291646/android12conversationswidget2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: XDA-Developers&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12’s rumored conversations widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RxJW2u"&gt;Beyond the UI changes, the screenshots show a new privacy indicator that’s similar to what’s found in iOS. It acts as a warning in the status bar to show when an app is accessing the camera or microphone. &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; also reports there is an alleged overhaul of the privacy settings in Android 12, with the ability to fully toggle the camera and microphone on / off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62POyo"&gt;Other screenshots show what could be a new conversations widget for Android 12. It appears to surface recent messages and calls, and &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; claims it could be a “mandatory feature for all Android 12 devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzelkw"&gt;Google hasn’t officially confirmed any new UI or feature changes to Android 12 yet. The company has committed to making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21472139/google-android-12-app-store-installation-payment-fees"&gt;third-party app stores easier to use in Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, though. Google typically previews the upcoming version of Android in March. Last year, Google surprised everyone with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143789/google-android-11-developer-preview-release-5g-security-early"&gt;early Android 11 developer preview&lt;/a&gt; in February, so we could be just weeks away from seeing what’s in store for Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the UAE’s first deep space probe reach Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pE702mV51HinDAO3Njm8pI_t3os=/0x1:4096x2732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791419/EMM_Hope_1289__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="516T4F"&gt;A robotic probe owned by the United Arab Emirates is preparing to jump into Mars orbit on Tuesday after launching from Earth last year. For mission managers in Dubai, it’s a nerve-racking climax in the UAE’s first mission to deep space. If successful, the &lt;em&gt;Hope&lt;/em&gt; probe will survey the Martian atmosphere. The Emirati cabinet hopes the mission will also inspire a new science and technology sector as the Gulf state looks to wean its economy from oil dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWD6Wo"&gt;The Hope probe launched from Japan’s Tanegashima Space Center last July as Earth and Mars aligned in their orbits around the Sun. Now, having traveled over 300 million miles, Hope is set to carry out an intricate and fully autonomous maneuver called a Mars Orbit Insertion at 10:30AM ET. Mission control in Dubai won’t know if the MOI has begun until 10:42AM ET because of a 22-minute roundtrip communications delay through NASA’s Deep Space Network. Manual, real-time control is impossible, so Hope will need to carry out these orbital dances on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ePrrRq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’ve thought of every single scenario that may go right or wrong”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v5XVTr"&gt;The MOI requires Hope to slow its cruising speed of 75,000 mph down to 11,000 mph in order to get swept up in Mars’ gravity. It will hit the brakes by firing all six of its Delta-V thrusters for 27 minutes. That should put the spacecraft into a “capture orbit” around the red planet. Five minutes later, mission managers will lose contact with Hope as it flies around the far side of Mars, cutting off radio signals for about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtlF1w"&gt;“It’s been rehearsed enough times, we’ve thought of every single scenario that may go right or wrong, and that has been programmed into the commanding sequence,” Sarah al-Amiri, the deputy project manager for the Emirates Mars Mission, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrIVsb"&gt;Hope’s mission team of roughly 450 people have been designing and testing the Hope spacecraft over the past six years in preparation for this mission. If all goes well, the Hope mission will make UAE the fifth space-faring power to reach Mars after the United States, Soviet Union, European Space Agency and India.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTK6z7"&gt;Over the next two months, Hope will carry out a few more maneuvers to jump into a closer orbit around Mars. This will be key for carrying out its main objective: scanning the Martian atmosphere and capturing a global snapshot of the planet’s weather patterns. Hope will orbit Mars every 55 hours and capture a complete snapshot every nine days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ5pyv"&gt;The Emirates Mars Mission’s Twitter account will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HHShkMohd"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; updates throughout the mission. The UAE space agency will also host a &lt;a href="https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/live"&gt;live feed&lt;/a&gt; of mission control in Dubai starting at 9AM ET before the maneuver begins at 10:30AM ET. Tune in then, to see if UAE nails its first interplanetary mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 studio falls victim to ransomware attack, data leak threatened</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UPsck80pK85rvipiVM6GYpcCvTo=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791295/cyberpunk_2077_800.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgvVbZ"&gt;CD Projekt says it’s been hacked by attackers who’ve been able to access its internal network, encrypt some devices, and collect “certain data” from the Polish video game company. The &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer says it will not give in to the demands or negotiate with the attacker, and does not believe any personal data of players or service users has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IRC9w"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660"&gt;tweet disclosing the hack&lt;/a&gt;, the company shared the ransom note left by the hackers, who claim to have accessed the source code for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gwent&lt;/em&gt;, and an “unreleased version of &lt;em&gt;Witcher 3.&lt;/em&gt;” The hackers are threatening to release the source code alongside internal legal, HR, and financial documents “if we will not come to an agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xkTXzK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Important Update &lt;a href="https://t.co/PCEuhAJosR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PCEuhAJosR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED (@CDPROJEKTRED) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DbjzoK"&gt;In its statement, CD Projekt says that it has secured its IT infrastructure, and has begun restoring its data from intact backups. It says it has informed the “relevant authorities” as well as IT forensic specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1nvBm"&gt;The attack follows the developer’s troubled launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;The game released with numerous bugs and performance issues on PC, and was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22166912/cyberpunk-2077-base-ps4-xbox-one-bugs-issues-glitches-performance-trees-bushes"&gt;almost unplayable&lt;/a&gt; on older consoles. Sony subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled the game from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; and offered refunds to players, while Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;also offering refunds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1QzRh"&gt;CD Projekt has been subjected to intense criticism for releasing the game in what critics claim is an unfinished state. The company has vowed to address &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s &lt;/em&gt;performance issues&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;a series of patches&lt;/a&gt;. It’s now facing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;lawsuit from investors&lt;/a&gt; who claim they were misled about the game’s performance prior to release. The developer has also been criticized over reports that its employees were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;forced to work long hours&lt;/a&gt; in the months leading up to the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s CEO wants to talk to President Biden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Huawei Founder Ren Zhenfei Defiant in Face of Existential Threat" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dsTdD_1vM1pdBOjbEt_LxPrcR7k=/0x3:4240x2830/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68791163/1146396255.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ywa5HK"&gt;Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has called for a reset in relations between the US and the Chinese tech giant. Speaking to international media in China for the first time in more than a year, Ren expressed willingness to speak with President Biden and said he hoped for an “open policy” from the new administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaSejD"&gt;“I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success,” Ren said in officially interpreted comments &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-welcome-phone-call-from-us-president-biden.html"&gt;reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/huawei-ceo-hopes-reset-us-053713079.html"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3121109/huaweis-ren-zhengfei-calls-more-open-us-policy-towards-china-under"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The US wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBEW63"&gt;“If Huawei’s production capacity can be expanded, that would mean more opportunities for US companies to supply too,” Ren continued. “I believe that’s going to be mutually beneficial. I believe that (the) new administration would bear in mind such business interests as they are about to decide their new policy. We still hope that we can buy large volumes of American materials, components and equipment so that we can all benefit from China’s growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ELCDGf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Living a Google-free life with a Huawei phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I1WQik"&gt;Huawei is currently unable to do business with US companies because the Trump administration placed it on the Department of Commerce’s trade blacklist, citing national security fears. Among other issues, this means Huawei is unable to license Android from Google, severely hampering its smartphone business outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsVcPY"&gt;This prompted Huawei to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243559/honor-v40-announced-huawei-google-sanctions-specs"&gt;sell off its Honor subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the brand and allow it to keep on producing smartphones, but Ren dismissed rumors that Huawei might do the same for its own smartphone division. “We have decided we absolutely will not sell off our consumer devices, our smartphone business,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KuUL1"&gt;Ren also reportedly called the iPhone 12 “the world’s best smartphone” and said that it helped make the case for Huawei’s 5G networks. “High-end customers in Europe love Apple,” he said. “Since [Huawei] doesn’t have premium handsets any more, Apple’s phones have helped us prove that Huawei’s 5G technology is good.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will start reminding users to clean out their friends list</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Snapchat stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7djfIVKR0LECwGevjPbI7ZG2H8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790994/snapchat-stock-0963.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUorx2"&gt;Snap is introducing a new feature it’s calling Friend Check Up. On Snapchat, having someone friended could give them access to your story and even possibly your location, depending on your Snap Map settings, so Snap wants to make sure that everyone on your friends list is still someone you actually want to call your friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLGZ0w"&gt;This feature could help make the platform safer for users, if they choose to use it. It could be a good way to help you realize you might still have somebody friended that you don’t want to see your posts. And I know there’ve been plenty of times when I’ve looked at a friend or follower of mine and said “I have no idea who this person is,” or worse: “oops, my ex can see my sadtweeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltBRxZ"&gt;Snap says that the feature will be rolling out globally on Android “in the coming weeks” and to iOS devices “in the coming months.” The reminder will show up as a notification on your profile screen, as you can see in this GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZ5MTW3FH55onBIeHoVNpBXie6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291047/friend_checkup.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Friend Check Up feature shows a notification reminding you to look at your friends list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HoSYJE"&gt;If you’d like to do a check up yourself before the feature rolls out, you can see your friends list by going to your profile and tapping on My Friends. You can remove a friend by tapping and holding on their name until the Block / Remove friend menu appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgjG0Q"&gt;The Friend Check Up feature is part of a push from Snap to make Snapchat a friendlier place, including adding new resources and integrations with the Trevor Project for LGBTQ+ youths, and MindUP for parents trying to understand and support their teenage children. The social network is also getting further integration with the Crisis Text Project for people seeking mental health assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood sued for wrongful death by family of 20-year-old who died by suicide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4E0DF19-tktuXqwLlFsBNRI-rY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68790593/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBeyyM"&gt;Last June, 20-year-old Alex Kearns &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/young-trader-dies-by-suicide-after-thinking-he-racked-up-big-losses-on-robinhood.html"&gt;died by suicide&lt;/a&gt;, blaming stock trading app Robinhood for his death. He mistakenly believed he’d lost $730,000, and that the company was coming for more than $170,000 of that money in a matter of days. His family now agrees that it was Robinhood’s fault — on Monday, they sued the company for wrongful death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXK3ec"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F493835850%2FKearns-v-Robinhood-complaint&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F8%2F22273600%2Frobinhood-alex-kearns-wrongful-death-lawsuit-stock-options-trading#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, Kearns never owed any money at all, but that didn’t stop the Robinhood app from suggesting that he did, or sending him an “immediate action required” email telling him he needed to deposit $178,612.73 by June 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQMOAv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillBrewsterSCG/status/1273008513950928896"&gt;Here’s a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; one of his relatives shared on Twitter last June of what the app reportedly showed him at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gwm9Hl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RobinhoodApp&lt;/a&gt; response and can confirm they did reach out. The family isn’t ready to speak yet. Since they can’t release account details here’s the screenshot. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uqeDhro7aJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uqeDhro7aJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bill Brewster (@BillBrewsterSCG) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillBrewsterSCG/status/1273008513950928896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ylzk7h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t7bWow"&gt;Kearns reportedly tried to contact Robinhood’s support department four times, but only got an automated message. The day after he died, Robinhood sent another automated message to let him know he didn’t actually owe money at all, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alex-kearns-robinhood-trader-suicide-wrongful-death-suit/"&gt;according to a &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; story that includes an interview with Kearns’ family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3aFAj"&gt;Later that month, when the news of his death spread, &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/6/19/commitments-to-improving-our-options-offering"&gt;Robinhood promised to change how its app worked&lt;/a&gt;, educate its users, and pledged $250,000 to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGhrKq"&gt;The new lawsuit isn’t the only reason this story is freshly relevant. Robinhood is also now facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;dozens of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; for its role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;the GameStop / Reddit / Wall Street Bets saga&lt;/a&gt;, where individual traders banded together to manipulate stocks that had been shorted, but some traders are blaming them for huge losses after Robinhood froze how much and when they could invest. The company’s software also automatically sold some options (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;though not shares, Robinhood claims&lt;/a&gt;) out from under traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7D5Ki"&gt;Either way, the huge run on GameStop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266684/gamestop-stock-gme-down-dip-falling-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;now seems to be over&lt;/a&gt;, and unlike Kearns, many people may have lost tremendous amounts of real money gambling via Robinhood and other apps. If you know someone who did, they can find &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/"&gt;the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-273-8255.&lt;/p&gt;
