    <title>Qualcomm’s aptX Lossless promises CD-quality audio for wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dk29DEtxQYdRiLuQXBli0-Hdbo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805804/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbMPQK"&gt;2021 has been a big year for lossless music now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple has gone in on the higher-quality streaming&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;no longer charging an added premium&lt;/a&gt; for it. But one of the main challenges confronting lossless audio is how to play it wirelessly (at full fidelity) on wireless headphones and earbuds. Qualcomm thinks it has found a solution with the new aptX Lossless, which is part of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313214/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-announced-high-res-audio"&gt;Snapdragon Sound program&lt;/a&gt; announced earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pBU86"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/09/01/qualcomm-adds-bluetooth-lossless-audio-technology-snapdragon-sound"&gt;With aptX Lossless&lt;/a&gt; (which is technically an extension of aptX Adaptive), Qualcomm says it’ll be able to stream CD-quality, 16-bit / 44.1kHz lossless audio over Bluetooth. The first devices to feature the new technology are expected to be available in early 2022. Snapdragon Sound leans on the whole hardware chain for optimal performance — so both your Android mobile phone and your earbuds or headphones will need to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrFKKt"&gt;But if they do, Qualcomm says Snapdragon Sound will automatically detect a lossless audio source and be able to play it at much higher data rates than previously possible with aptX HD. The company has managed to outdo Sony’s LDAC in terms of bandwidth: aptX Lossless can hit up to 1Mbps compared to LDAC’s ceiling of 990kbps. There’s still some compression being applied; CD-quality music typically has a sample bit rate of 1.4Mbps. But Qualcomm is using lossless compression to deliver mathematically bit-for-bit exact audio reproduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlEzQz"&gt;In environments with a lot of wireless congestion, the bit rate will dynamically scale down as low as 140kbps to maintain the best audio performance based on connection quality. LDAC can struggle in real-world scenarios when you’re pushing it to its bit rate limits, so it’s not surprising to see Qualcomm offer a solution to smoothen out the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbpBpE"&gt;CD quality is where aptX Lossless tops out. You can still &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; hi-resolution audio tracks, but that’ll result in lossy streaming, so you’ll want to keep a wired solution around if you’re big on those 24-bit 96kHz files. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Broadcasters secure a win in their fight against scrappy TV streamer Locast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3k_FyTp-QAQYE0N0y9z8TCojkw4=/0x10:2164x1453/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805756/locast.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6rHoaV"&gt;ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox have secured a victory in their legal fight against Locast, a nonprofit that re-streams their local broadcast stations at little to no cost, much to the consternation of those networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoqByd"&gt;Locast is a service that makes local broadcasts free — kind of, we’ll get to that — to those who may be unwilling to pony up for cable or live TV streaming services, or just don’t want to hook up an antenna in their living room. Those four networks are already broadcast over-the-air for free; Locast then uses a &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/111"&gt;legal exemption&lt;/a&gt; in copyright law to re-transmit their broadcasts and put them online for people to more easily access. Locast doesn’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; charge for its service, but it does &lt;a href="https://www.locast.org/donate"&gt;ask for donations&lt;/a&gt; that start around $5 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6W0q0"&gt;Essentially, users can use Locast to bypass traditional means of accessing broadcast networks on the super cheap. This hasn’t gone over well with the big four broadcasters, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748677/locast-streaming-tv-lawsuit-abc-cbs-fox-nbc"&gt;claimed in a 2019 complaint&lt;/a&gt; that Locast’s business was “an acknowledged effort to devalue the entire market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4leTbm"&gt;This week, a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21052725-locast"&gt;court ruled&lt;/a&gt; in the broadcasters’ favor by agreeing with their arguments that because Locast frequently prompted users to donate through interruptions to their programming, and that those costs exceeded “the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the service,” it was not operating within the boundaries of the exemption. The ruling was made on the grounds that collected funds were being used for expansion, rather than maintaining operation alone. The Hollywood Reporter &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/broadcasters-score-big-legal-win-against-locast-a-popular-app-streaming-network-tv-1235006305/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xGW0h"&gt;While the case isn’t over, the ruling could potentially imperil Locast’s ability to operate as it currently does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUHhW6"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which joined Locast’s legal defense team last year, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/am/deeplinks/2021/09/court-ruling-against-locast-gets-law-wrong-lets-giant-broadcast-networks-control"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that the court’s decision “reads the law in an absurdly narrow way,” adding that the copyright’s retransmission exception for nonprofits was written to make local broadcast stations widely accessible. The foundation further said that the ruling threatened access to local news and information for millions of Locast users during a time of “unprecedented” natural catastrophes and amid an ongoing pandemic. It added that it’s evaluating next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qocYoE"&gt;“Make no mistake, this case demonstrates once again how giant entertainment companies use copyright to control when, where, and how people can receive their local TV broadcasts, and drive people to buy expensive pay-TV services to get their local news and sports,” the foundation said. “We are disappointed that the court is enabling this callous profiteering that tramples on Congress’s intent to ensure local communities have access to news that’s important to people regardless of their ability to pay. The court made a mistake, and Locast is considering its options.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new fantasy sports-like prediction games let you blast your boldest picks to everyone you know</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLV8EKR4x_WUeGIyxna-B04TNu0=/0x0:890x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805644/NRP_Fantasy_Games_on_Facebook_Inline_3__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of Facebook’s fantasy sports.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BIxGuH"&gt;Facebook is adding fantasy sports-like prediction games that will let users guess what’s going to happen in sports, TV shows, and pop culture. The new games, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/"&gt;called Facebook Fantasy Games&lt;/a&gt;, are rolling out first on the iOS and Android apps for users in the US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikji9v"&gt;The first game available is Pick &amp;amp; Play Sports, a daily sports prediction game it made in partnership with Whistle Sports. (It was already available in the iOS app for me, so it might be for you, too.) In the “upcoming months,” Facebook plans to release additional games for TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Bachelorette&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt;, sports leagues like Major League Baseball, and one made with &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed. &lt;/em&gt;Games will have public leaderboards, but you can also make your own public or private leagues if you want to compete with smaller groups or just talk trash. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jDsxLMOt_YJab7j0jZUI3FjTSQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821138/NRP_Fantasy_Games_on_Facebook_In.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compete with your family and friends by making leagues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zH7Yba"&gt;The games don’t appear to have features that let you put real money on the line, though, so if you want to get into wagers, you’re going to have to handle those transactions yourself. It also doesn’t seem like Facebook is offering traditional fantasy sports leagues right now. But this could be Facebook’s first toe in the water to compete with big fantasy sports entities like DraftKings and ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sQPtV"&gt;Facebook has been expanding more into gaming as of late in an effort to keep people using its services. The company launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple"&gt;web app for its cloud gaming service in July&lt;/a&gt; to get around Apple’s App Store rules and let iOS users to try it out. It also offers a Twitch-like streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaming/feed/"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;. These new fantasy games offer something different than those more traditional gaming offerings, but they are perhaps a better fit for the social network — it seems easy to share a bold pick on your feed and wait for the reactions to roll in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech companies face pressure over January 6th subpoenas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Gadsden Flag flag left by Pro-Trump protesters who entered the U.S. Capitol building is seen after mass demonstrations in the nations capital during a joint session Congress to ratify President-elect Joe Biden on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gJ-bqcDJ0b3uq-WwmxH85v8jVLU=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805415/1230490671.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JCQLwx"&gt;As Congress pushes for more details of the January 6th attack on the Capitol, tech companies have found themselves caught between a new request from the select committee investigating the attack and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/jan-6-riot-mccarthy-trump-telecom-companies/2021/09/01/cad1753c-0b1d-11ec-9781-07796ffb56fe_story.html"&gt;ominous threats from Republicans&lt;/a&gt; hoping to stall the committee’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxOkqc"&gt;Pushing for new details about communications between Republican members of Congress and President Trump during the attack, the House select committee sent data requests on Monday ordering the preservation of phone records and other communications related to the January 6th attack. Requests went out &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/january-6-committee-telecoms/2021/08/30/a2592168-0997-11ec-a6dd-296ba7fb2dce_story.html"&gt;to 35 companies&lt;/a&gt;, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft. Wireless providers like AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless also received the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O3H1LB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A Republican majority will not forget”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cynUsP"&gt;Notably, the requests are likely to target some members of Congress who communicated with President Trump during the attack. Both House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) reportedly discussed the attack with President Trump and could potentially be implicated by such a probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4ej0L"&gt;So far, Republican leaders have condemned the effort. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1432820807684739073"&gt;In a statement Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, McCarthy described the subpoenas as an effort “to strong-arm private companies to turn over individuals’ private data” and threatened retaliation from future administrations if the companies complied with the orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHN99q"&gt;“If these companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States,” McCarthy wrote. “If companies still choose to violate federal law, a Republican majority will not forget.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS8nJQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1432866784432979969"&gt;Speaking on Fox News that night&lt;/a&gt;, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) put the threat in blunter terms. “These telecommunication companies, if they go along with this, they will be shut down,” Greene said, “and that’s a promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArTP1x"&gt;Thus far, the companies at the center of the fight are mostly saying quiet. Google affirmed its commitment to working with the committee but did not explicitly commit to serving the data request. “We have received the Select Committee’s letter and are committed to working with Congress on this,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “The events of January 6th were unprecedented and tragic, and Google and YouTube strongly condemn them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UMgJu"&gt;Reached by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook gave a similar statement, saying, “We have received the request and look forward to continuing to work with the committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YClPnf"&gt;Microsoft and Twitter declined to comment, while Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;amp;T did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit bans anti-vaccine subreddit r/NoNewNormal after site-wide protest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YcYsMB1FBV95UyuCdereAQI_Jvc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805134/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDlPkK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/"&gt;Reddit has banned&lt;/a&gt; anti-vaccine and anti-mask subreddit r/NoNewNormal and has quarantined 54 other subreddits associated with COVID denial. A week ago, the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/"&gt;company’s CEO said in a post&lt;/a&gt; that Reddit was meant to be a place of “open and authentic discussion and debate,” even for ideas that “question or disagree with popular consensus.” In today’s post, the company has clarified its rules with regard to health misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BnndB"&gt;The subreddit NoNewNormal has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651653/amazon-ivermectin-misinformation-autocomplete"&gt;cited by many&lt;/a&gt; in the Reddit community as a source of vaccine misinformation, and it was known for “brigading” other subreddit’s discussions by butting in on conversations about COVID or related policies in other communities. NoNewNormal was the source of 80 such brigades in the past month, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/"&gt;according to Reddit security&lt;/a&gt;, and the behavior continued after the community was warned, leading to its ban. The community had &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgqmg/reddit-quarantine-nonewnormal"&gt;previously been quarantined&lt;/a&gt;. For the 54 other subreddits that have been quarantined, Reddit warns potential visitors that medical advice should come from doctors rather than forum members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Are you sure you want to view this community? This community is&amp;amp;nbsp;quarantined This community is&amp;amp;nbsp;quarantined: For medical advice, please consult your physician.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message that appears when trying to visit a quarantined community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WEQGEw"&gt;Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;along with other social networks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651653/amazon-ivermectin-misinformation-autocomplete"&gt;online marketplaces&lt;/a&gt;, has struggled with misinformation about COVID treatments in recent weeks. The platform has rules that seek to address the concerns but admits how it was interpreting and enforcing those rules hasn’t been clear. In today’s announcement, it stated that it classifies health misinformation as “falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader.” It also says that health disinformation means “falsifiable health information that has been manipulated and presented to mislead” and gives the example of posting fake advice attributed to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text that reads: Futurology has gone private to protest Reddit’s inaction on COVID-19 misinformation. Weaponized misinformation is a key problem shaping our Future. Reddit won’t enforce their policies against misinformation, brigading, and spamming. Misinformation subreddits such as NoNewNormal and r/conspiracy must be shut down. People are dying from misinformation." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSiXSz3PWcOThkUyoy-AdjMHsgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820677/Screen_Shot_2021_09_01_at_11.19.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message that displays when trying to view the Futurology subreddit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="738uCs"&gt;In its post, Reddit cites users’ frustration with the platform’s “handling of COVID denial content.” Recently, a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N8theGr8/comments/pelle1/subs_going_dark/"&gt;large number of Reddit’s most popular subs&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651653/amazon-ivermectin-misinformation-autocomplete"&gt;been going private&lt;/a&gt;, hiding their posts from people who aren’t subscribed to them, to protest the company’s inaction. The action was partially spurred by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;the spread of misinformation around ivermectin&lt;/a&gt; — a drug whose veterinary form meant for livestock has been recommended as a cure for COVID, despite &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;the Food and Drug Administration’s warnings&lt;/a&gt; that using medicine for animals can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTLYYn"&gt;Even before Reddit’s announcement today, some users were trying to take the situation into their own hands — /r/Ivermectin has been spammed with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ivermectin/comments/pfat0h/couldnt_get_ivermectin_going_to_try_this_instead/"&gt;shitposts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ivermectin/comments/pf9b0c/trans_rights_trans_rights_trans_rights_trans/"&gt;calls for trans rights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pesfa4/rivermectin_has_been_classified_as_nsfw_as_users/"&gt;furry porn involving horses&lt;/a&gt;. (The link is a reasonably SFW explanation.) The latter got the sub marked as NSFW, and the flurry of posts has made it difficult to hold conversations on the now-quarantined community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zV8ORq"&gt;The fast-approaching Labor Day holiday promises to bring plenty of great tech deals on notable favorites, including smart speakers, headphones, TVs, and tablets. While we regret to inform you that it is, sadly, not yet the weekend, there is a wide selection deals already available at retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and B&amp;amp;H Photo, many of which are likely to run through the rest of the week and into the long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eq0I3N"&gt;Right now, there are savings to be had on devices like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 and second-gen Apple Pencil, and we’ll be sure to bring you more as the week unfolds, both on-site and in your inbox via our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;Verge Deals newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, check out these early Labor Day deals on a wide swath of tech goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

The current sale price is the best we’ve seen outside of Amazon Prime Day. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Right now, they’re $130 at Amazon, the cheapest we’ve seen the true wireless earbuds in recent weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Normally $379, you can pick a refurbished pair with a two-year warranty at eBay for $100 off. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="UwF2fK"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750762530221522587#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Mini (64GB, Wi-Fi)&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly on track&lt;/a&gt; to receive an update in the fall, but the 2019 model still offers solid performance, a headphone jack, and twice the storage as the entry-level iPad. It’s available in silver at Best Buy for just $299, its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s official MagSafe Charger&lt;/a&gt; is available on sale at Amazon for $30, a historical low it only recently hit. The Qi-compatible puck can magnetically attach to any model in the iPhone 12 lineup, and provide the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro with up to 15 watts of power when used in conjunction with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20-watt power brick&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aL1xA4"&gt;The red &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm, GPS)&lt;/a&gt; is $319 at Amazon, a 20 percent discount on what we consider to be the best smartwatch available. Apple’s latest wearables features a fantastic display in addition to built-in sleeping tracking, though, it remains exclusive to iOS. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li id="Qqwe4N"&gt;Apple’s official &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHMJ77?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Battery Case for the Phone 11 Pro&lt;/a&gt; is just $52 at Amazon, matching the lowest price we’ve seen on the pricey charging case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2bflBD"&gt;Laptop deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NoAtnZ"&gt;

&lt;li id="X83rCF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Blade-Base-Gaming-Laptop/dp/B08LZYN1ZF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Blade 15 gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; is big, built nicer than most Windows laptops in its class, and offers solid performance even if you opt for the base model. Right now, Amazon has the Intel i7 six-core machine for $1,173, saving you nearly $327 on the 2020 model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our 2021 Razer Blade 15 base review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CcAnYV"&gt;Microsoft is offering up to $300 off a number of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7%2F8n17j0m5zzqs%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt; tablets. The base model with an Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage is $100 off for a starting price of $650, though there are numerous configurations on tap to satisfy whatever needs you may have from Microsoft’s versatile tablet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 55-inch The Frame QLED&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at Amazon for $1,298, the second-best price we’ve seen on the art-inspired, 4K TV, which displays a range of artwork when not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HuwLBD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-32GN650-B-Ultragear-Reduction-FreeSync/dp/B08LLF9NS1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG 32GN650-B QHD gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt; may look like a jumble of letters and numbers but it also looks like a great value, one that comes with a 2560 x 1440 display, a 165Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time. Couple that with HDR10 support, FreeSync to prevent screen tearing, and a $297 price tag at Amazon, and you’ve got yourself a sweet 32-inch monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QgTlgI"&gt;Smart Home deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="XtyABd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id="wU4vwa"&gt;The endearing, sphere-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; is $20 off at Amazon. This $80 price tag has only been beaten during Amazon Prime Day, when Amazon devices are at their cheapest, but it’s still a great value for an affordable Alexa-equipped smart speaker that offers impressive sound quality and tunes itself based on the room. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6BMeA0"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1597173-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01420_us_nest_audio_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22648524%2Fbest-early-labor-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-laptops-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; also offers room-filling sound and stereo pairing at an affordable price, and the smart speaker’s current $20 discount at B&amp;amp;H Photo keeps it on equal footing with Amazon’s aforementioned Echo. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The capable smart display — which is a bit sluggish, in our testing — can track your sleep if you choose it to be your bedside assistant, and it can display images directly from your Google Photos account. Walmart’s current discount brings the price down to $70, regardless of which color you choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5iQopm"&gt;The 10-inch &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750565611530617461#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt; is best put to use as a video calling device, especially with tech-averse family members who already use Facebook. Best Buy’s latest discount brings the Portal down to $100, matching its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dhCk0e"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is small enough to live by your bedside and loud enough to wake you up in the morning. Even with its small stature, it can do just about anything other Echo speakers can do, even if it is limited when it comes to video calling and video streaming. Today, you can buy it for just $55 ($30 off) at Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EhBQDn"&gt;Philips is running a promotion on its &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750569053894295875#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hue White and Color E26 smart bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy a three-pack of the colorful bulbs, you pay the same price as you would for two of them, effectively a discount of $35 that brings the price of three bulbs down to $100. Philips doesn’t often discount its app-enabled bulbs, and this is a great way to get started with smart lighting or stock up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

You don’t have to be a streamer to appreciate the better video quality and a bit of fill-in light even on a casual Zoom call, either, and you can get the Kiyo at Amazon for just $64.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7K6hXb"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCKQD77?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G Pro gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; is about as sleek, minimalist, and lightweight as it gets when it comes to wireless, high-performance mice. It was developed with consultation from pro gamers, but it has an ambidextrous design that doesn’t scream “gamer” from a half-mile away. It’s now on sale for $85, its lowest price to date, at Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="67Du69"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LQX2GXZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Steel Series Aerox 3 Super Light&lt;/a&gt; gaming mouse weighs only 57 grams and is only $40 at Amazon right now. The speedy, affordable peripheral even comes with RGB lighting. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="tKNd40"&gt;DJI’s OM4 gimbal is perfect for anyone looking to get into video recording on a budget.

The Mini 11 is one of the more affordable models in the current lineup, and it is discounted to just $60 at Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p id="7jEBWV"&gt;It hasn’t even been two months since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Amazon CEO Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; took the reins from founder Jeff Bezos, but the company’s new chief executive is already facing a potential scandal. Two anonymous sources have accused Jassy of stepping in to overrule the company’s own HR department when it recommended that an executive be fired for discrimination — and Amazon isn’t denying it, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/aws-jassy-bell-discrimination"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9mr06"&gt;The story goes that in 2019, a Black female Amazon employee accused AWS Outposts general manager Joshua Burgin of discrimination, and HR issued a report recommending he be fired. But Jassy fielded a personal request from Burgin’s boss, Charlie Bell, and decided to let him stay. (At the time, Jassy was CEO of AWS, Bell was a star cloud executive who also reportedly served as a member of Amazon’s senior leadership team, and Burgin was Bell’s chief of staff. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/microsoft-hires-charlie-bell-former-amazon-cloud-exec.html"&gt;Bell recently moved to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PZrIlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We [...] took what we believe was the appropriate corrective action”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpR5wH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; writes that when it presented Amazon with “a detailed account of the events,” the company didn’t dispute it: “In this instance, we conducted a thorough investigation and took what we believe was the appropriate corrective action,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWVbgc"&gt;Amazon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it didn’t have anything to share beyond that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7B76J"&gt;In July, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590134/amazon-harassment-discrimination-allegations-investigation"&gt;pledged to investigate&lt;/a&gt; allegations of discrimination and harassment inside its AWS unit after 550 Amazon workers signed a petition accusing the company of fostering an “underlying culture of systemic discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias against women and under-represented groups.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444635/amazon-five-discrimination-retaliation-lawsuits-warehouse"&gt;Five specific female Amazon employees also sued the company for discrimination&lt;/a&gt; in May, three of whom still worked for Amazon at the time. It’s not clear whether the worker who accused Burgin — and by association, Jassy — is one of those five, but &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; suggests she’s suing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas is set to pass a new law banning Facebook from censoring conservatives</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SHQd9DjmtSLS1l74gI8WpI8CYY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805013/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wj6U5c"&gt;Texas is one step closer to enacting a law that would make it more difficult for social media companies to moderate political content. Both Texas’ House and Senate approved the bill earlier this week, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2FcAI"&gt;The bill would make it unlawful for social media companies with more than 50 million users, like Facebook and Twitter, to censor users and content based on political views or geographic location. This includes moderation actions like banning, deplatforming, or demonetizing users and removing posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9j9BA0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill initially failed in a special session earlier this year &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PkJCT8"&gt;The bill initially failed in a special session earlier this year when Democrats fled the state to stall the passage of controversial partisan bills, including measures to ban abortions once &lt;a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2021/09/01/407551/texas-now-has-a-ban-on-abortions-as-early-as-five-weeks-anti-abortion-groups-are-prepared-to-enforce-it/"&gt;a fetal heartbeat&lt;/a&gt; is detected and new voting restrictions. The social media “censorship” bill was revived in July in a second special session. It was approved in the House on Monday and the Senate late Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hf4wSN"&gt;It’s unclear when Abbott may sign the bill. His office did not immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZW1cRz"&gt;Texas is the second state to push through a bill aimed at combating the alleged censorship of conservatives online. In May, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a similar measure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;would fine platforms&lt;/a&gt; for banning political candidates. The law was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558086/florida-social-media-theme-park-law-preliminary-injunction-lawsuit"&gt;blocked by a Florida US District&lt;/a&gt; Court judge in June. The judge wrote that much of the bill’s text was “wholly at odds with accepted constitutional principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3O8709"&gt;The Texas bill could face a similar fate, according to experts. “While the language in Texas’s bill is different, the outcome will be the same because the First Amendment protects against government intrusion into editorial discretion,” Ari Cohn, TechFreedom counsel, said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMErdh"&gt;The bill was widely opposed by Democrats, but many did not attend the vote as they protested other controversial measures led by Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v686Hn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible 7 are delayed again due to COVID concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RIHuoqlRpyxw_g8EWSUfmADWcIg=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805006/top_gun_maverick.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WXClTS"&gt;Paramount is delaying the rest of its 2021 film slate, moving &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; from its Thanksgiving weekend release date to May 27th, 2022, close to three years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699765/top-gun-maverick-tom-cruise-sequel-trailer-watch-san-diego-comic-con-2019-ed-harris"&gt;after it was first announced&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also moving &lt;em&gt;Jackass Forever &lt;/em&gt;to release on February 4th, 2022, instead of the originally planned October 22nd, 2021, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/top-gun-maverick-flies-from-thanksgiving-to-memorial-day-weekend-mission-impossible-7-ignites-in-fall-2022-1234825624/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67tUgQ"&gt;Additionally, due to &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; taking its former May 2022 slot, &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt; is getting another delay: it’ll now be out on September 30th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUWUQd"&gt;The delays are due to concerns over the spike in COVID-19 cases caused by the delta variant of the virus. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; notes that Paramount, rather than risk releasing potential billion-dollar franchise starters like the &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; sequel seeing comparatively lackluster pandemic box office numbers, would rather just kick everything down the line in hopes that things will continue to improve in 2022. It’s for a similar reason that Paramount isn’t just shifting the films to its Paramount Plus streaming service — there’s simply too much money at stake here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4qXdrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More major movies are skipping 2021 releases in hope of better 2022 success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcKJGU"&gt;The news comes after Paramount had previously moved its &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/clifford-the-big-red-dog-release-delayed-paramount-1234807014/"&gt;live-action &lt;em&gt;Clifford the Big Red Dog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movie off of its September 17th release date over similar COVID-19 delays. The studio has yet to announce a new date for the movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aqmj2"&gt;Despite Paramount’s move, there are still several major films set to hit theaters in the coming months (at least, for now). Disney still has &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; set to bring the MCU back to theatrical exclusivity on September 3rd, followed by &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt; on November 5th. &lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/em&gt; is slated for October 18th (although there have been rumors of Sony considering a delay), &lt;em&gt;Ghostbuster: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; on November 19th (as Sony &lt;a href="https://bleedingcool.com/movies/sony-delays-ghostbusters-afterlife-a-week-after-top-gun-moves-to-2022/"&gt;moves to take &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt;’s vacated spot&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; set for December. There’s also the long-delayed James Bond film, &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, which was one of the first films to be impacted by COVID-19 delays. It is set to finally hit theaters in the US on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9izJIR"&gt;Lastly, Warner Bros. still has some of its biggest tent poles on the calendar for the end of 2021: &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; (on October 22nd) and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; (on December 22nd.) Unlike the previously mentioned films, though, those movies won’t be theatrical exclusives. Thanks to WarnerMedia’s unique 2021 release strategy, they’ll also be available on HBO Max the same day that they debut in theaters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants a Watch with more health tracking and could ship one next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Apple Watch with a red wristband sitting on a table, showing the blood oxygen app. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Z__tueWCUapiDH9cJIZsAxj8gk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69804936/vpavic_200930_4216_0239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xqG5yh"&gt;Apple apparently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has a growing wishlist of health features for future versions of the Apple Watch, some feasible and some far-fetched. According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-blood-pressure-measure-wrist-thermometer-in-watch-11630501201"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s plans include various types of monitoring, including blood pressure, temperature, sleep, and blood sugar. The details come just after reports that the release of the next Apple Watch is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;likely to be delayed&lt;/a&gt; because of manufacturing issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upEVw8"&gt;Some of the planned features outlined by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; involve adding new sensors to the Watch. Apple wants to develop a sensor that can act as a proxy for a blood pressure cuff without squeezing the wrist. Blood pressure measurement has been in Apple’s plans for years; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/7/17438526/apple-blood-pressure-monitor-patent-apple-watch"&gt;filed a patent application&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 for a wearable blood pressure monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjcQv0"&gt;Apple’s competitors are also interested in blood pressure tracking. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch was approved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295264/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-blood-pressure-tracking-ecg-korea"&gt;track changes in blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea last year. There’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236373/samsung-galaxy-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-health-fda"&gt;debate around the accuracy&lt;/a&gt; and usefulness of the feature, and it has to be calibrated with measurements from conventional blood pressure cuffs every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDY6p1"&gt;Apple had plans to add a temperature sensor to this year’s Watch, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-14/apple-plans-faster-watch-future-temperature-and-glucose-sensors?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;earlier reports from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the addition appears to have been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pushed to next year. The first slated use for temperature sensing, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, might involve&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fertility tracking, with hopes that it could eventually detect fevers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1WvhI"&gt;Other wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon’s Halo Band&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;Fitbit’s Sense&lt;/a&gt;, have sensors for skin temperature, though that measurement is different from the internal body temperature read by a thermometer. Earlier this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568421/natural-cycles-birth-control-app-oura-ring-fda"&gt;Food and Drug Administration cleared digital birth control Natural Cycles&lt;/a&gt; to use temperature data from wearables like the Oura smart ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NgLwoY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has been chasing some of these features for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdi1vg"&gt;Apple also wants to expand the Watch’s sleep and blood oxygen tracking abilities, says the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, to someday be able to detect sleep apnea, a disorder that causes people to stop breathing during sleep. Sleep disorders are complicated, and diagnostic sleep studies involve multiple kinds of monitoring through the night. For that feature to work,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Apple would probably&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have to figure out the best times to take blood oxygen readings — keeping the sensor on all night would drain the battery pretty quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRrjFm"&gt;Apple reportedly also plans to seek FDA clearance for existing Watch features, like heart rhythm tracking for people with irregular heart rhythms and alerts for drops in blood oxygen levels. The current FDA clearance for the Watch’s EKG feature doesn’t include use by people who have a diagnosed heart rhythm condition like atrial fibrillation, and the Watch’s blood oxygen monitor isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance"&gt;cleared as a medical device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV5fIQ"&gt;One of the furthest-out features that Apple is continuing to study, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, is blood sugar tracking and diabetes detection. Apple has been trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15685148/apple-watch-glucose-tracker-blood-sugar-monitoring-diabetes"&gt;develop noninvasive glucose monitoring&lt;/a&gt; for years and reportedly hasn’t had much success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2xPcL"&gt;The anonymous sources cited by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; caution that many of the features being considered “might never be rolled out to consumers.” Health tech advancements, and regulatory approval for them, take years of development and testing. As much as companies want to add a slew of health features to wearables — and even as wearables are more commonly used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;in medical research&lt;/a&gt; — they’re still not advanced enough to replace&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;conventional diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVxMIO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
