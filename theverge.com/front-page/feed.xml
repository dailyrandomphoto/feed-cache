    <title>Nvidia announces new RTX 3080 with 12GB of memory</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESTLWN"&gt;Nvidia is launching a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F30-series%2Frtx-3080-3080ti%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878021%2Fnvidia-rtx-3080-12gb-model-release-date-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new 12GB model&lt;/a&gt; of its RTX 3080 today. Revealed initially in Nvidia’s latest GeForce drivers, the new 12GB model goes on sale today from select board partners and offers 2GB more memory than the original 10GB RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NioVbA"&gt;A memory bump is welcome, particularly as it was a source of concern during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;initial review of the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. It also matches the 12GB found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;RTX 3080 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. This new RTX 3080 model also includes 8960 CUDA cores, a bump of nearly 3 percent over the original. The upgraded memory also means this GPU has 20 percent more cumulative bandwidth over the original 10GB variant, thanks to a wider 384-bit memory bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qgtTu"&gt;Nvidia is still recommending a 750W power supply, but this 12GB RTX 3080 draws an extra 30 watts of power, up to 350 watts in total compared to the 320W draw on the original RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1AKxj"&gt;It’s a relatively minor upgrade over the original RTX 3080, and it’s guaranteed to be as difficult to purchase in stores. Nvidia’s new 12GB RTX 3080 arrives just days after the company also announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;new RTX 3090 Ti&lt;/a&gt; with faster memory and better performance, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22864989/nvidia-rtx-3050-gpu-ray-tracing-dlss-price-release-date-ces-2022"&gt;$249 RTX 3050&lt;/a&gt;. The budget RTX 3050 offers ray tracing and DLSS support at a much more affordable price, assuming you’re about to snag one at retail price. Nvidia is promising to detail more about the RTX 3090 Ti later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is an emotional culmination of a decade-long journey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H06KEjhgIckA5peHQnE1ciWcxaY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373989/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_32__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Thou must live, die, and know&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hWThCZ"&gt;The easiest way to describe &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is to call it a game about hope. That’s not really a unique descriptor since, to some degree, all &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games, MMORPG or otherwise, are about hope. (Not&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy VIII, &lt;/em&gt;though — that game is about child soldiers and hot dogs.) However, despite &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s unflagging commitment to “the power of friendship,” it’s the game’s unvarnished look at the other side of hope — oppressive and omnipresent despair — and the real strength it takes to maintain that hope in the face of such despair that makes it the best &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; experiences I’ve had in 30-plus years of the series’ existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXiBiJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Endwalker Spoilers throughout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4vx-ff7set65XWpkWjTVv6IkfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159274/FFXIV_1106PLL_Mediakit_Launch_Trailer_06.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eyXo9K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To all of my children in whom Life flows abundant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To all of my children to whom Death hath passed his judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soul yearns for honor, and the flesh the hereafter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look to those who walked before to lead those who walk after&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyETOq"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, the latest expansion of the Final Fantasy XIV MMORPG, your character and their rag-tag group of mercenaries for hire masquerading as a benevolent, non-governmental organization are tasked with averting the second occurrence of The Final Days, an apocalyptic event that sundered the world and all its people a millennium or so previous. Through the events of the previous expansion, you learn that the malevolent force Zodiark is key to unlocking the mystery of why the Final Days have returned, necessitating a trip to his prison on the moon. Because this is a JRPG and a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; game, besides, the plot isn’t as straightforward as that. Though this quick and dirty plot summary and &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer would have you believe Zodiark and the moon are your end goals, you conclude that plot in the first quarter of the expansion. What follows is a 60-plus-hour &lt;em&gt;feast&lt;/em&gt; of emotions that wrap up the last 10 years and four expansions’ worth of story in the most perfect of bows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orPHei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shining is the Land’s light of justice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever flows the Land’s well of purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z391l3"&gt;I play video games because I love stories, and video games promise me, more than books or movies, the opportunity to live in a story. I derive pleasure from suspending disbelief, imagining the characters I interact with as alive, their words and deeds organic and authentic, not a series of 1s and 0s strung together by someone else. Games are immersive and interactive, but there will always be an impenetrable veil between my real life and the fabrication of life a game presents. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;is a game that gets the closest to piercing that veil. It’s in the way the developers wrote the characters, the way the game lets me respond to those characters, and even the way the game makes my character emote in cutscenes. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, more than any of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s expansions, feels so alive I barely noticed the extremely late sleep-deprived nights I spent working my way through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrUMcL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walk free, walk free, walk free, believe...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Land is alive, so believe&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnk42P"&gt;The technical and financial limitations of video game development mean that the way stories are written and how characters act rarely reflect how real people behave and how real emotions are felt. In a video game, the death of a major character might evoke a singular moment of sadness wherein the game acknowledges a beloved friend died, before returning to normal, the death barely or never again recalled. By contrast, dealing with real grief isn’t a linear process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTTLLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;acknowledges grieving’s messy, winding road. In conversations with your companions, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; will suddenly flash back to a snowy grave and a broken shield, reminding you of Haurchefant Greystone, a friend who died protecting you way back in &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt;. The game remembers the sadness you felt in that moment and brings it back for you to feel again multiple times though it’s been several years and two expansions since, the same way real grief can suddenly reappear unbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDa-uMSuplBnE3B0v3jMEFpzVtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159323/2021_04_18_14_31_54_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Final Fantasy has never once let you forget Haurchefant’s sacrifice, and for that, I’ll love this game forever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JYiCI5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suffer (Feel) Promise (Think) Witness (Teach) Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Follow (Feel) Wander (Think) Stumble (Teach) Listen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Speak) Honor (Speak) Value (Tell) Whisper (Tell) Mention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgoBhm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;also exhibits what authentic growth as a person looks like. At the end of &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt;, your enemy, before he perishes, asks that you remember him and his extinct peoples. This adversary, Emet-Selch, fought against you because the only way for him to bring back his people is the destruction of your world. (Long story, but it makes sense in context.) Later in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a conversation in which you can respond, “Remember,” as though Emet-Selch’s words were something you took to heart. In other conversations, you can respond with quotes you’ve heard from friends lost expansions ago — “a smile better suits a hero,” or “for those we have lost, and for those we can yet save” — making it feel like the events of previous expansions weren’t just cutscenes you watched but lessons you learned from and acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xxk1am"&gt;This kind of grief and growth isn’t limited to the player character but your companions as well. One character, Alphinaud, makes a pretty terrible mistake back in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt;. Most games would have him apologize and move on, never referencing that mistake again. But for Alphinaud, in every expansion after his transgression, he brings up how he’s still trying to learn from it, demonstrating that remorse and repentance aren’t states of being but active processes that must be worked on continuously. I hated Alphinaud for his mistake. Of my companions, I liked him the least. All throughout &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;, I bore a grudge against him, a grudge that softened each time he recalled that mistake, owned it, and did things that showed he was working on never making that mistake again. By&lt;em&gt; Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, he was as dear to me as Haurchefant, something that only happened because the game didn’t force his redemption in a quick turnaround but showed it gradually and authentically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MKSqC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Endwalker is a 60-plus-hour &lt;em&gt;feast&lt;/em&gt; of emotions that wrap up the last 10 years and four expansions’ worth of story in the most perfect of bows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2PDFj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hope) Ponder (Hope) Warrant (Wish) Cherish (Wish) Welcome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Roam) Witness (Roam) Listen (Roam) Suffer (Roam) Sanction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sleep) Weather (Sleep) Wander (Sleep) Answer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsW2sp"&gt;In MMOs and other games in which you can create and personalize the main character, you’re often a blank slate. The bits of your personality you can give your avatar don’t extend beyond its physical appearance. Even in games that let you choose dialogue, you only get close to what you might actually say. In the rare moments &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; let you speak, the dialogue often reflected my exact feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDa7hY"&gt;In the game’s final zone, your comrades sacrifice themselves one by one in order for you to reach the final antagonist. Your last remaining companions are Alphinaud and his twin sister Alisaie — who had an easier time than her brother getting into my heart because I love her “punch the problem until it’s no longer a problem” attitude. They know, and you know that they’ll have to sacrifice themselves in order for you to continue. When Alphinaud tried to bring this up, I shouted at my screen, “Shut up! I don’t want to hear this,” because I couldn’t process losing characters I thought of as my children, especially after already losing all of my other companions. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s writers knew what I and many others were likely feeling at this moment, offering me the perfect dialogue response: “Not. Another. Word.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDc0iW9xI4Vmbt0xwbYVMpXpFwU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159320/2022_01_04_14_50_41_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;I get by with a little help from my friends.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kUwcSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now open your eyes while our plight is repeated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still deaf to our cries, lost in hope we lie defeated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaS3WH"&gt;In addition to giving me the perfect dialogue choices, I’m impressed by &lt;em&gt;Endwalker’&lt;/em&gt;s ability to intuit exactly what I want as a player. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s writers know the game’s strength lies in its characters. So often, character-driven games like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will shunt you from quest to quest, giving you very little time to do what you really came for — to just hang out with your pals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue058b"&gt;In the latter half, the player is sent into the past in hopes of learning what happened during the first Final Days. There, I was reintroduced to characters I met and had grown attached to in &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt;. My first thought was, “Oh, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; let me run a dungeon with them,” thinking there was no way that would happen. (In &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;, you can run dungeons with other players or create a party out of your NPC companions.) Even though these characters occupy a significant place in &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;’s lore, they would only be around for this one area. I believed there was no way the developers would invest in making them combat-capable for what could only be a one-off thing. One of my first true shocks and moments of pure delight was when the game let me run a dungeon with Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus, and Venat watching my back. It’s one of the coolest story moments in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCPiTf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our souls have been torn, and our bodies forsaken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bearing sins of the past, for our future is taken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfpp1r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t really innovate in its gameplay, but its story is so good that it doesn’t have to. My two main jobs are gunbreaker and astrologian — a tank and healer class, respectively. Tweaks to the leveling system meant that the main story quest line didn’t reward enough EXP for me to level my two classes. A lot of times, there wasn’t enough main story quest EXP to take a single job from one level to the next, requiring me to create an elaborate and efficient EXP extraction plan so I could level my two jobs evenly with minimal grinding, which I utterly hate. Frustrating as all that math was, I enjoyed the intricate dance of dungeon running and side-questing; it kept the calmer, less exciting parts of the story interesting. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of running full tilt at a fate — quests available only at a certain place for a certain amount of time — hoping to get there before other players complete it and its sweet, sweet double EXP award is lost to you forever. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zzcPMFDddvcyRsOGSlWX8KCTPmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159372/2022_01_05_21_00_29_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Endwalker is so well constructed that this character is not merely an avatar of me, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; me. (And she’s so pretty!)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tqxZur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;War born of strife, these trials persuade us not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words without sound, these lies betray our thoughts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mired by a plague of doubt, the Land, she mourns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judgment binds all we hold to a memory of scorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3AyVk"&gt;There is no way anyone at Square Enix could have known &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; would launch in the middle of a global pandemic, when its message of radical, defiant hope would hit the strongest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIsiWs"&gt;Its main antagonist, Meteion, is a being made to intuit others’ emotions and tasked with understanding life. To that end, she was sent to find sentient beings on other planets to ask them their meaning of life. Meteion found planets destroyed by war or natural catastrophe or populated by beings who so lamented their achievement of immortality that only death could give comfort. Finding nothing but death, and so subsumed by the infinity of suffering she found, she concluded that life is meaningless and death preferable, so she sets in motion the end of all life everywhere.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8GVjr"&gt;Omicron rages in the United States, where we recently broke the global record for number of infections in a single day. Even as vaccines become more available, every day, people die by the thousands, forced to say goodbye to loved ones through the cold, impersonal screens of cellphones and tablets. Every day, I live and labor in a country in which its hate for my people and other marginalized identities are baked into its every institution. I struggle under the oppressive weight of a government that would risk its citizens’ health and safety in order to keep an economy running. Every day, my social media feeds are choked with tales of pain and sadness, preventable and not. Now, more than ever, it seems like life is a pointless struggle, and I can barely find the strength to keep going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRXlBP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell us why, given Life, we are meant to die, helpless in our cries?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGt4MJ"&gt;Video games like to answer this dilemma of hopelessness with a protagonist or companions who have either boundless optimism or boundless strength. Whatever they have, it’s always enough to overcome the problem. It’s the same kind of toxic positivity of social media influencers. “Everything will be OK so long as you believe.” It’s a philosophy that takes the act of faith for granted without confronting the reality of how hard it is to believe in the face of the relentless suffering life throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KlxAvz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So often, character-driven games like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will shunt you from quest to quest, giving you very little time to do what you really came for — to just hang out with your pals. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeCBaR"&gt;Throughout your journey in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV,&lt;/em&gt; your character endured prolific suffering and loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMMwZP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t blindly ask of you your faith. Rather, it uses the trials of your character’s life as proof you already have the strength required to continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xni20y"&gt;In a world beset by relentless bleakness, I need that message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJhoJv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness (Feel) Suffer (Think) Borrow (Teach) Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Follow (Feel) Stumble (Think) Wander (Teach) Listen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxo5xg"&gt;I am the kind of person for which aural memories last longer and evoke more emotion in me than memories of sight or touch. When I first saw the trailer for &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; back in 2013, even though I hadn’t played the original doomed &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV &lt;/em&gt;before its reboot and wouldn’t play until years later in 2021, I cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="etom6B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h542YbZuwkQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5j7gj"&gt;In the trailer, there’s a fierce battle in which it looks like the good guys are losing badly. I didn’t know who any of the characters were, nor did I care about them, but I still cried as a woman sang, lamenting their pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HahuvI"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, one of the first songs you hear isn’t the song “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zTTtd6bnhFs"&gt;Footfalls&lt;/a&gt;” from the trailer — it’s this song “Answers” from nine years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mom1Lk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; game director Naoki Yoshida said that &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; would be the conclusion of the story begun in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; — the story begun by this trailer. I was skeptical that a single expansion could deliver on that promise, believing it would still be an enjoyable experience but fail to live up to such vaunted expectations. But when &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; first played “Answers,” I understood that whatever happened, it would make good on Yoshida’s declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pDPoG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; songfic — a common fanfiction format in which a story is based around a song. The story evokes the song’s themes and sometimes the song’s lyrics are woven into the text of the story itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIi6pW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Blink) Whisper (Blink) Shoulder (Blink) Ponder (Blink) Weather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Answer (Look) Answer (Think) Answer together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQpHok"&gt;The true beauty of &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is realizing that for a decade, we’ve been working backward. Yoshida meant for &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; to tie up everything that began in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; and achieves that by having &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; ask the question &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn &lt;/em&gt;answered 10 years ago: what is the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1czZk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thy Life is a riddle, to bear rapture and sorrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To listen, to suffer, to entrust unto tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkhuvM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; does not mince its words. It nakedly acknowledges in a way games seldom do that life really does seem pointless in the face of omnipresent death.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qR5ZhPbdoMW-oUfRT3fXbCmXeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159306/2022_01_10_16_14_06_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yes, G’raha Tia, you can haz cheezburger&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GiHA9v"&gt;Early in the game, you’re given the opportunity to take a break from all the terror that accompanies the end of the world and have a party with your friends. The table was littered with some of the best-looking video game food I’ve seen, including a tasty cheeseburger the party’s resident catboy, G’raha Tia, tears into, in fulfillment of an internet question asked ages ago — &lt;a href="https://cheezburger.com/875511040/original-cat-meme-that-started-cheezburger"&gt;yes, you can has cheeseburger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dx2524"&gt;That’s it. That’s life. A struggle for survival punctuated by pockets of joy made sweeter because of the loved ones around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0xTLq"&gt;I don’t need a video game to teach me a lesson, especially if the lesson is essentially “Life sucks, and then you die.” But it’s nice to have a game that acknowledges shit sucks without overselling its misery while also ending on a hopeful note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNLf4r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In one fleeting moment, from the Land doth life flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet in one fleeting moment, for anew it doth grow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the same fleeting moment thou must live, die and know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Done your Wordle for the day? Try out these spoofs instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4oIxtrk6Ty8ioXNMa97iJqpYpSo=/17x0:635x412/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373921/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_12.56.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stupidest (and hence best) Wordle spoof we’ve seen: Letterle. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://edjefferson.com/letterle/" target="_blank"&gt;@edjeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V7UXTF"&gt;Part of the charm of &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt; — this season’s must-play puzzle game — is that you can only do it once a day. But that’s also part of the frustration, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H30ziS"&gt;For while it is wonderful to think to yourself: “Ah, a coffee break. Time to sit down and do my Wordle” (part and parcel of the indulgent “&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3ed08931-80b0-43a0-9bba-6c4bcc1b3e70"&gt;treat brain&lt;/a&gt;” we all seem to have developed during the pandemic), you sometimes want to scratch that puzzle itch just a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkHipr"&gt;With that in mind, here are some of the best and stupidest Wordle spoofs we’ve seen so far. They either push the format to ridiculous degrees, offer genuinely fun challenges, or are single-click jokes that may, at least, help temporarily release you of your Wordle cravings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zmnlro"&gt;1) &lt;a href="https://sweardle.glitch.me/"&gt;Sweardle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4l0CY70wM6DMU2eBGvWu8I9Y17w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160485/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.06.05_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nVHFWT"&gt;This one does exactly what the name suggests. You’re guessing swear words instead of words from Wordle’s more expansive vocabulary. Results are delivered with snippy little remarks: “Correct. I’m sure your mother will be very proud,” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="v5dYdv"&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://queerdle.com/"&gt;Queerdle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFyPoFizRi_DdW-gAlFSorm-RaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160488/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.07.33_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1lmmpc"&gt;Wordle but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/style/yassify-bot-meme.html#:~:text=To%20%E2%80%9Cyassify%E2%80%9D%20something%2C%20in,becomes%20almost%20unrecognizably%20made%20up."&gt;yassified&lt;/a&gt;, with a pastel background and on-theme congratulations (“Shantay you stay!”). The creator warns that winning words are more likely to be NSFW than with Wordle, but there are shortcuts to winning. As one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1479349936525385729"&gt;commenter on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; put it: “the secret to Wordle is knowing the distribution of letters in English and opening with words that have a lot of common letters in them. the secret to Queerdle is doing this once and then guessing the gay word.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o7uD2K"&gt;3) &lt;a href="https://edjefferson.com/letterle/"&gt;Letterle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7ZkCwkaAPVgVPZCp1fFQ1TeBWro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160495/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.15.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7zranS"&gt;I love a single-click spoof as much as the next person, and Letterle delivers on that score. Every day it offers a new and tantalizing puzzle! Every day you have the chance to test your wits and intelligence by guessing a single hidden letter! How devious! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3tbK2"&gt;I got today’s in just six guesses, which, I choose to believe, is as good and as rigorous a proof of Mensa-level IQ as any other test on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IJip76"&gt;4) &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/files/wordle/index.html"&gt;Absurdle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87UfsRh8u38ElzAgZXWVhcVuir0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160497/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.17.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ROOpnQ"&gt;This is a self-described “adversarial version” of Wordle. As explained &lt;a href="https://qntm.org/wordle"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Absurdle tweaks the rules of Wordle to make the game harder as you take more guesses. While Wordle fixes its objective word each day, Absurdle &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; the word you’re hunting for each time you submit a successful guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtD56h"&gt;So, for example, Absurdle might start with the word “CIGAR” for which you guess “TERNS.” The game notes that you got the “R” right, but then changes its location with a new word: “REBUT.” And so on and so forth. Basically it makes a game of Wordle harder and longer. But you do get infinite guesses as compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4kBOgh"&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://foldr.moe/hello-wordl/"&gt;hello wordl&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rd3K9K9LHSM512MZE79uG-qji0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160499/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_1.22.08_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnYUKt"&gt;This one is exactly the same as Wordle, but you can play multiple times a day &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; change the length of the word you’re guessing. If you manage to solve anything with more than six letters then congratulations to you. I struggled for 10 minutes with a 10-letter puzzle only to give up and be told the word was... adrenergic. Warning: for masochists only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGVJg"&gt;If you’ve seen any other decent Wordle spoofs (or just fun alternatives) feel free to drop them in the comments below. The &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Slack is overrun with Wordle addicts, and we could do with a new way to get our fix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NordicTrack will now let you yell at its smart dumbbells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman does russian twists with dumbbells while watching a workout on a tablet attached to the rack." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3t-fDE8GB2gWTcI61BMJNlDJHA=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373777/Female_Twist_NordicTrack_iSelect_Voice_Controlled_Dumbbells.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NordicTrack’s new smart adjustable dumbbells also come with a tablet holder in the rack.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: iFIT&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8CO05f"&gt;Smart dumbbells aren’t new in connected fitness, but today, NordicTrack is announcing a unique take on the product. The NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells are voice-controlled weights that work with Amazon Alexa. As in, you can now ask Alexa to adjust how heavy your dumbbells are instead of having to do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQHfcY"&gt;The dumbbells can be electronically adjusted between five and 50 pounds in five-pound increments. According to iFit, NordicTrack’s parent company, the dumbbells feature a “motorized weight selector” that enables users to quickly change the weight of the device. As for the Alexa integration, you can ask the voice assistant to set a specific weight, increase or decrease weight, or create a preset weight for specific exercises. You can create presets for 15 common dumbbell moves: biceps curls, overhead shoulder press, lateral shoulder raises, front shoulder raise, triceps extension, bent-over row, chest press, squat, deadlift, lunge, lateral lunge, wood chop, chest fly, reverse fly, and renegade row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tum6KB"&gt;While an iFit subscription is not required to use the dumbbells, the weights come with a free one-month family membership. You also need a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection, ostensibly for firmware upgrades and other support features. The dumbbells also come with their own rack, which is outfitted with a tablet holder so you can follow along with workouts from either iFit or whichever fitness app of your choice. The dumbbells can also be adjusted manually via a knob.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Woman turns knob embedded into the rack to adjust dumbbell weight" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oWgM6-vO6q5UCZc8d4XRbfdOOyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159342/Mechanical_Adjust_NordicTrack_iSelect_Voice_Controlled_Dumbbells.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iFit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also adjust the weights manually via a knob.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5PfOB0"&gt;At this point, you might be wondering: what is the point of voice-controlled dumbbells? Aside from accessibility reasons, it boils down to speed. If you’ve ever followed along with a fitness app’s strength training class, you’re often given only 10-30 seconds in between sets. Many adjustable dumbbells work using a pin mechanism to attach or detach additional plates — meaning if you rush, you can wind up with a plate falling off mid-exercise. (True story: instead of hitting pause, I rushed while tweaking my adjustable dumbbells and ended up with a five-pound plate smacking me in the face during a chest press.) You also have to return the dumbbells to the rack each time to add or take off plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AntlKA"&gt;If the dumbbells can actually quickly and safely change weights, that’d solve one of the biggest problems with adjustable dumbbells. However, other connected weights make similar promises with mixed results. I tested &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/jaxjox-kettlebell-connect-review-this-connected-kettle-1844285865"&gt;JaxJox’s smart adjustable kettlebell&lt;/a&gt;, and while it was convenient, it still took a hot second for the electronic locking mechanism to secure the weights. In this case, you’d still have to contend with Alexa understanding your commands, good Wi-Fi, and background noise from whatever class you’re watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Gj2Ja"&gt;At $429, these are on the cheaper end of connected fitness equipment but are still a hefty investment for the average person. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21443765/buying-dumbbells-online-expensive-resellers"&gt;dumbbell prices have been wonky&lt;/a&gt; ever since the start of the pandemic thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21396116/dumbbell-set-shortage-nordictrack-bowflex"&gt;shortages and shipping delays&lt;/a&gt;. As far as adjustable weights go, options with a similar weight range can cost anywhere from $200 to over $500. A full dumbbell rack can cost a few hundred or go well into the thousands of dollars — and may take up much more space than you’d like in your home. Another factor to keep in mind is that you need an Alexa-enabled device to use the voice controls. If you don’t have already have one, that’s another purchase to tack on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8lnLb"&gt;We’d have to review the NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells before we can definitively say how useful the voice-control feature is. But if you’re impatient, the dumbbells are available starting today at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/3036981011?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordicTrack’s Amazon store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify shuts down its namesake podcast studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it6jtllLRW5240UPkUQieAcnIMw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373807/mdoying_180308_1437_0030still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71v860"&gt;Spotify is disbanding its founding podcast studio and laying off some of the team. An affected employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Studio 4, or Spotify Studios as it’s been referenced externally, consisted of 10 to 15 employees and produced shows like &lt;em&gt;Dissect &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Chapo: Kingpin on Trial&lt;/em&gt;. Spotify called affected employees on Friday and said their last days would be January 21st. They’ll receive two months’ worth of severance. Some employees were reassigned while others were laid off and pointed to the Spotify job board. The studio’s head, Gina Delvac, was also let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OelVqs"&gt;Spotify declined to comment. In a note to Spotify staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, Julie McNamara, head of US studios and video, acknowledged the layoffs and said shutting the studio down would enable the company to “move faster and make more significant progress and facilitate more effective collaboration across our organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdXRxB"&gt;For a company sharing news of its podcasting endeavors most anywhere it can, Studio 4 rarely, if ever, showed up in the press. (I only documented one public use of it.) However, Studio 4 &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; occasionally appear in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Shareholder-Letter-Q2-2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;earnings reports&lt;/a&gt; as Spotify Studios. It was the first podcasting studio Spotify created and consisted of all the employees who worked on podcasting prior to the company’s major network acquisitions. Additional employees were later hired, but the initial group helped prove the podcasting business model and listener interest with shows like &lt;em&gt;Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls 1 Keith&lt;/em&gt;, says a former employee who asked not to be identified due to ongoing work in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="agRZsB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1522405"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xItWBc"&gt;The team eventually rounded out Spotify’s in-house studio offerings, including its three acquired networks: Parcast, Gimlet, and The Ringer. The Studio 4 name is literal, as in it’s the fourth studio at Spotify. It’s also, as one Spotify employee put it to me, “insulting” to the people who work there, given that it has no brand identity or mission statement. They say it often operated more like a “junk drawer” for projects that didn’t find a home within the other three networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tbRof"&gt;“When you have Studio 4, it’s like, ‘Well, if all of these boxes are already checked by all of these other studios, then where does that really leave us,’ and so it felt to me like there was no clear mandate of what Studio 4 was supposed to do,” the affected employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcXcJG"&gt;Though the studio didn’t have its own clear initiatives, its content covered music and artists as well as celebrity deals and influencer-hosted content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t09lSM"&gt;“A lot of the successes that Spotify Studios had were never really vocalized because the leadership was always churning,” the former employee says, pointing out that Liz Gately &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/spotify-liz-gateley-podcast-creative-development-1203152298/"&gt;formerly ran&lt;/a&gt; the studio but was then &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/liz-gateley-to-transition-to-consultant-role-at-spotify-4107080/"&gt;shuffled&lt;/a&gt; into a new role. Delvac took over, and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-julie-mcnamara-1235007800/"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; McNamara &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-julie-mcnamara-1235007800/"&gt;was hired&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the team. Courtney Holt, VP of global podcasting, previously held the role. (Above Holt and McNamara sits Dawn Ostroff, chief content and advertising officer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orjDdZ"&gt;“I have never once heard anybody mentioned Studio 4 by name or point to any of the work or the shows that we’ve done as something to be celebrated,” the affected employee says. “We’re being intentionally disregarded in explanations about metrics, and growth, and listenership, and all that kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lK2kgp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc8C0C"&gt;“When you go through a year of that ... where you’re behind the scenes, and you’re creating things, and it just doesn’t get the love or the shine that the other studios get, I think that causes a lot of rightful thoughts to be going through your head of like, ‘Hey, what does the upper echelon of the executive community at Spotify think about the studio, what we’re doing, and how easily could they just sweep it under the rug,’ which they ended up ultimately doing,” the former employee adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HKcWR"&gt;The team most recently produced programming like &lt;em&gt;Nosy Neighbors, We Said What We Said&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Dope Labs&lt;/em&gt;, as well as partner programs like Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s 2020 holiday special. The former employee says that one show, &lt;em&gt;Wind of Change&lt;/em&gt;, was produced under the studio, but was then handed to Gimlet to oversee the next release in the Pineapple Street Studios partnership — &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Your Fantasy. &lt;/em&gt;They say&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;successes were given away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsNvk4"&gt;Since Studio 4’s inception, Spotify spent millions not only buying up new studios and networks, but also securing high-profile deals with big podcasting names like Joe Rogan, Alex Cooper of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534981/spotify-exclusive-podcast-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Dax Shepard of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also focused heavily on its ad technology with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of hosting company Megaphone, which was the centerpiece of most of the company’s announcements this past year. However, Spotify hasn’t shared numbers on how its acquired entities are doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLDnMI"&gt;Though Spotify says more podcasts than ever are on its platform, an August &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-leaked-data-gimlet-podcast-studio-struggled-2021-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; said Gimlet itself has struggled to grow inside the tech company due to “unclear strategy” and “internal tensions.” It had the lowest numbers of all four studios in terms of consumption hours in leaked metrics for September 2020. Meanwhile, a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22632213/joe-rogan-experience-spotify-exclusive-audience-reach"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Spotify’s licensed exclusives, Joe Rogan’s show specifically, might have lost a significant chunk of its audience in the move to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6A8gOY"&gt;For now, Spotify hasn’t said how partner programs will be produced moving forward and what will happen to shows currently in production. Original programming will obviously live on within the three networks Spotify bought, but Studio 4’s shutdown shows that Spotify wasn’t able to build a wholly independent production team from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGAaVu"&gt;When asked what the studio’s biggest show was, or what people should know about, the affected employee couldn’t name one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1EpGi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 11th, 8:59AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article previously stated that Julie McNamara worked under Courtney Holt. That was incorrect. Holt only previously held McNamara’s job, and he now leads a separate team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox players are fed up with forced crossplay against PC gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7dXLX2wLXjzQ5_Nh6k8o8gAcvA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373674/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNt15I"&gt;Xbox players are growing increasingly frustrated at being forced to play against PC gamers. While crossplay was initially a popular request from Xbox and PC players that Microsoft has backed strongly for years, those playing first-person shooters on Xbox are struggling to opt out of the experience to avoid PC cheaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sye9V7"&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;force Xbox players to match against PC gamers in a variety of playlists. You don’t have to look very far to see why people are angry about it. “Now that cheating in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; is confirmed on PC, can we have to option to opt out of cross-play?” asked one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/qzkinm/now_that_cheating_in_halo_is_confirmed_on_pc_can/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in November, just weeks after the multiplayer version of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pVCUT"&gt;“Forced crossplay is a scam by Microsoft,” reads another post in &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/forced-crossplay-is-a-scam-by-microsoft/483900"&gt;Microsoft’s Halo Waypoint forums&lt;/a&gt;. “Forced crossplay is a mistake,” says &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/qurwr9/infinite_forced_crossplay_is_a_mistake/"&gt;another Redditor&lt;/a&gt;, and the list &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/qytykn/why_must_we_be_forced_into_crossplay/"&gt;goes on&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/rbcijs/halo_infinite_is_proof_that_sbmm_and_forced/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://xbox-forums.com/threads/microsofts-push-of-forcing-crossplay-between-pc-and-xbox-is-ruining-multiplayer-gaming.466559/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jCrKMz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"},{"title":"Cheaters are ruining Call of Duty: Warzone ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem"},{"title":"Call of Duty’s new anti-cheat system includes a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"},{"title":"Cheaters are already ruining Halo Infinite multiplayer games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XmrZMi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; are both suffering from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;influx of cheating&lt;/a&gt;, largely because they’re free-to-play titles so it’s easy for hackers to create a new account following a ban. While there’s an option to disable crossplay in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, if you try to load into a playlist on Xbox it will ask you to re-enable it. Whereas on PlayStation you can simply dismiss the prompt and continue to the playlist with crossplay still disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck7OvZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;players on Xbox have been complaining about this forced crossplay for more than a year, with various &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/call-of-duty-warzone-forced-crossplay/e9682d44-89e9-4c5e-a9ef-55ad6c2c89ea"&gt;forum posts&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/E28PF-UUpTs"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; highlighting how irritating it is to be forced into crossplay. Most of the issues are related to PC cheaters, who have plagued &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; for years before Activision finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;added a new anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt; in October with a kernel-level driver to catch PC cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5LuOI"&gt;Now that cheaters are already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"&gt;ruining &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer games&lt;/a&gt;, the call to remove forced crossplay is certainly growing louder. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; players on Xbox are matched against PC gamers in most playlists, and even in ranked modes you have to play solo or as a duo to avoid forced crossplay. If you want to squad up as a team of three or four, you’ll be forced to play against PC players in ranked &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; modes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZPn3O3cDbtbeap2dQKIukioe6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925721/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_25_237.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite is already suffering from an influx of cheaters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mQ65cM"&gt;Microsoft’s decision to force crossplay in its own &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; title runs against previous commitments from the company’s head of Xbox. “I’ll never force somebody in our games whose playing with a controller or a mouse and keyboard to play against somebody with a different control scheme,” said Xbox chief Phil Spencer in an &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-head-talks-gaming-across-xbox-one-and-pc/1100-6436153/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Gamespot&lt;/em&gt; in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. “Mouse and keyboard rotation speed is faster than controller. We know that, you’ll lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxXFM0"&gt;Nothing has changed in the classic arguments between mouse and keyboard players and controllers. Xbox players simply want the option to be able to opt out of crossplay, and not to have to be forced to play against PC players. A lot of PC players would also like to avoid controller aim assist in games like &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBEwID"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; launched in November with forced crossplay for Xbox players, and an option to disable it for PlayStation owners. In a sign that things can change, Developer DICE was quick to &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-4"&gt;add the option&lt;/a&gt; to disable crossplay for Xbox players just a few weeks after launch. Even Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Sea of Thieves&lt;/em&gt;, the original darling of crossplay, added an option to disable forced crossplay a few years after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKoWpb"&gt;We reached out to both Microsoft and Activision to comment on the forced crossplay situation, and neither company was willing to issue a statement in time for publication. 343 Industries, the developer behind &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite, &lt;/em&gt;made it clear it’s trying to address the cheating issues in the game yesterday. 343 is hoping to address &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/halo-infinite-update-btb-and-more-jan-10/490385?u=ske7ch"&gt;cheating and “other things”&lt;/a&gt; in a patch in mid-February. 343 won’t be magically fixing cheating issues from its game with a single patch, but here’s hoping there’s an option to avoid most of them next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple promises third-party payment options in iOS for South Korean users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQJQNIA8NaFSDyGKzKg3lYPgVCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373581/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="20az7S"&gt;Apple says it will introduce third-party payment options for the first time ever in iOS apps,  following South Korean legislation designed to open up the perceived monopolies of Google and Apple’s app stores. The alternative payments will only be available in South Korea and follows the announcement of similar changes by Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QknUEg"&gt;Apple’s decision was shared by the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) and reported by &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20220111004700320?input=tw"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News Agency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but details of the implementation are thin on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFNs7Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arguments over payment fees triggered the Epic Games trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0W7ewy"&gt;Apple currently charges developers a 30 percent fee on any digital purchases made by consumers using iOS apps. This fee has become increasingly contentious for developers, and was at the heart of the huge US lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;between Apple and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the lawsuit, a judge ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;allow third-party payments&lt;/a&gt; in the App Store, but this order was later put on hold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;due to an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. (Apple has since made a tiny concession to “reader apps” like Netflix, allowing them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;link to websites to sign up users for new accounts&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s nothing like allowing in-app third-party payments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOsnAI"&gt;In South Korea, lawmakers have upheld complaints by developers about in-app payments, leading to new legislation. Apple says its will charge developers a reduced fee to use third-party payment options (just as Google has promised for its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763040/google-in-app-purchases-alternative-south-korea-payments"&gt;third-party payment support&lt;/a&gt;), but some developers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1480807630817878020"&gt;say it’s unfair&lt;/a&gt; for these companies to charge any fee at all. Apple and Google say fees are necessary to maintain and promote their app platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43SzGz"&gt;Apple has not said how much it will charge developers to implement third-party payments in South Korea, or when this option will be available, or how exactly these new payments will be made available to consumers. The exact details of the implementation will be vitally important, as seemingly small decisions in things like app store UI can be used to steer consumers one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PU1Ya1"&gt;“Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea’s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country’s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love,” Apple told &lt;em&gt;Yonhap &lt;/em&gt;in a press statement. “We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obscenely detailed scan lets you peer at Rembrandt’s Night Watch masterpiece online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJRM5TxLz0rDUJ6K2ogLHSUNHic=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373546/Operation_Night_Watch___Rijksmuseum_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The level of detail is staggering.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rijksmuseum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hpNkdV"&gt;The Rijksmuseum has released what it claims is the “largest and most detailed photograph of any artwork,” and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-photo"&gt;viewable for free on its website&lt;/a&gt;. The scan is of Rembrandt van Rijn’s 1642 masterpiece &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/em&gt;, a roughly 12 by 14 foot painting which is currently the focus of a massive research and restoration project called “Operation Night Watch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbqF0C"&gt;The technical details of the scan are staggering. In a &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/press/press-releases/rijksmuseum-publishes-717-gigapixel-photograph-of-the-night-watch"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Rijksmuseum explains that it’s made up of 8,439 individual photographs taken with a 100 megapixel Hasselblad H6D 400 MS camera. Neural networks were reportedly used to check each image for color and sharpness, and an AI system helped stitch these photos together into a single image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y2s8z"&gt;The result is a 717 gigapixel image that’s 5.6 terabytes in size, where each of its pixels shows an area just 5 micrometers in size on the original painting. The museum notes that it’s four times sharper than the last scan that was put out by the museum, which was &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; 44.8 gigapixels big, and where each pixel represented a comparatively massive 20 micrometers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrRjSLa2KTYlfwxVNUXao0G5mic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160429/Operation_Night_Watch___Rijksmuseum__2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rijksmuseum&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IvjwdM"&gt;The impact is a little mind-boggling, allowing you to zoom in to see the cracks that have appeared in the individual brush strokes of this masterpiece. Arguably it’s an even better experience than seeing the painting in the flesh, since this software allows you to really press your nose up against it in a way that would get you thrown out of most museums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7ulKE"&gt;If you’re willing to sacrifice a bit of resolution, then the website also has an &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/night-watch-including-missing-pieces"&gt;alternative version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch &lt;/em&gt;with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548402/rembrandt-night-watch-uncropped-artificial-intelligence-rijksmuseum"&gt;missing cropped sides&lt;/a&gt; restored. These sections were stripped from the painting in 1715, allowing it to fit in a more cramped location in Amsterdam’s City Hall. These missing segments were restored last year based on a 17th-century copy of the original painting made by Gerrit Lundens. This work was also completed as part of the same Operation Night Watch project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="525OyY"&gt;The Rijksmuseum’s press release notes that this scan will help with research of the painting, especially remotely. It should also allow researchers to track how the painting ages going forward with more accuracy. With the scan complete, the museum notes that it now plans to mount &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/em&gt; onto a new stretcher to correct deformities in the canvas that have appeared, and that it will consider other “conservation treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOeTDR"&gt;The high resolution scan of &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-photo"&gt;viewable here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/night-watch-including-missing-pieces"&gt;version with its missing sides is here&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s got you in the mood for looking at more high-resolution scans of classic works of art, check out this 10 gigapixel scan of &lt;a href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/"&gt;Johannes Vermeer’s &lt;em&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s funding threatened by Marco Rubio after ‘humiliating apologies’ to China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2019 ChinaJoy In Shanghai" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lv2Pmwe2gIPLHKM-YfqSMQKyUQQ=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373467/1165707843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a31M0j"&gt;US Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has threatened the government funding of chipmaker Intel after the company made what Rubio described as “humiliating apologies” to China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mj86fj"&gt;Intel issued apologies to its Chinese partners and the Chinese public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods#comments"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; after it noted in a routine letter to suppliers that it would not use “labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.” This stipulation is &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2021/12/23/biden-signs-the-uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act-into-law/"&gt;required by US law&lt;/a&gt; as part of trading sanctions against China for its ongoing persecution of the Xinjiang region’s Uyghur population (which the US government has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/trump-china-xinjiang.html"&gt;designated a genocide&lt;/a&gt;). Intel’s letter to suppliers, though, went viral in China, and caused a huge public backlash against the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNyJtR"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods#"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last year, Intel not only issued public apologies but also deleted all references to Xinjiang on its website. When asked about this deletion, Intel’s senior director of corporate comms, William Moss, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We amended some language based on concerns from stakeholders to focus on broadly and globally applicable principles and policies, consistent with our general practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3B65"&gt;In response to Intel’s actions, Rubio &lt;a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=D0696334-4F97-413F-B7CB-E45AE5DF0625"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Monday: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="njANRu"&gt;“Intel’s cowardice is yet another predictable consequence of economic reliance on China. Instead of humiliating apologies and self-censorship, companies should move their supply chains to countries that do not use slave labor or commit genocide. If companies like Intel continue to obscure the facts about US law just to appease the Chinese Communist Party then they should be ineligible for any funding under the CHIPS Act.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ugxEvn"&gt;The CHIPS Act is a reaction to the global shortage of semiconductors and the United States’ dwindling ability to manufacture these vital components. CHIPS was enacted last year as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062192097/house-passes-ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act"&gt;annual military funding bill&lt;/a&gt; (the National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA), with the Senate authorizing $52 billion in federal investments to go to “domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing provisions.” However, that funding is only speculative as of right now, as despite broad bipartisan backing the legislation is &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/chips-manufacturing-congress-subsidy"&gt;currently stalled in Congress&lt;/a&gt;. That means Rubio’s threat to Intel is, itself, only hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Redownload your Harry Potter e-books from Pottermore before they disappear for good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HDtZaV-StBEChlLYHYap5Uu0jQ=/0x1:1277x852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373453/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_9.09.22_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An email sent to customers warning them about the change.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pottermore&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBNziK"&gt;If you own digital Harry Potter books purchased on Pottermore, you might want to redownload your copies before the option disappears for good at the end of the month. The site is emailing its customers to warn them that the books will no longer be available to redownload after January 31st, since being removed from sale in September last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwyWkM"&gt;When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7928325/harry-potter-ebook-oyster-subsciption-service"&gt;launched back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Pottermore was the only official way to download digital copies of the Harry Potter books. Despite big stores like Amazon running promotions for the titles, which are some of the best-selling books of all time, stores would funnel customers to Pottermore to complete the sale (retailers like Amazon reportedly still got a cut, however). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TZIUKa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey, remember when they forced Amazon to require users to buy e-books through Pottermore to read Harry Potter on a Kindle? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bj6ydScp5S"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bj6ydScp5S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan C. Gordon (@icculus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1479635293099671555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v7wJtL"&gt;But sales of the e-books &lt;a href="https://www.scotsman.com/regions/harry-potter-digital-arm-loses-ps6m-and-sheds-jobs-2461743"&gt;reportedly declined over the years&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2015 they were made available directly from other online stores. Digitally enhanced editions launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9477815/harry-potter-apple-ibooks-enhanced-edition"&gt;Apple’s e-books store in October 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and releases on other digital stores like Amazon followed later that year. Pottermore eventually &lt;a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/a-new-wizarding-world-website"&gt;morphed into WizardingWorld.com&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vo3loS"&gt;Although the option to redownload existing book purchases from Pottermore will disappear for good at the end of the month, it shouldn’t be too hard to hold on to your existing digital copy. On Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1479637303433867272"&gt;Ryan C. Gordon notes&lt;/a&gt; that existing downloads consist of a DRM-free .epub file, which you should be able to transfer to any new e-readers in the future (though you have to &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/ebook-readers/41944/how-to-put-free-ebooks-on-your-amazon-kindle"&gt;convert the .epub file&lt;/a&gt; to make it readable on a Kindle). Just be sure to stash the file somewhere safe if you don’t want to pay again for books you already own in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
