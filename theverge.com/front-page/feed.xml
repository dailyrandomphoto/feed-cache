    <title>Bond film delays are reportedly causing product placement havoc for brands</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0IsE2s"&gt;The latest James Bond movie’s pandemic-related delays are reportedly causing problems for its marketing deals, with advertisers concerned that the film may end up featuring outdated product placements, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13847637/james-bond-re-shoots-product-placement-deals/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. The 25th Bond film, &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, is currently due to release in cinemas on October 8th, over a year after it was originally meant to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAJpek"&gt;“Some of those things were the very latest models back when they started filming” a source told &lt;em&gt;The Sun, &lt;/em&gt;“but by the time the movie comes out now it will look like Daniel Craig and all of the other cast members are carrying something that has been out for ages. That isn’t really the point of these deals.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2JULk"&gt;Although the film will reportedly feature Omega watches, Bollinger champagne, and Adidas footwear, it seems likely that HMD Global’s Nokia phones are at risk of dating most quickly. HMD Global announced last year that the film &lt;a href="https://www.hmdglobal.com/press-releases/one-epic-shoot"&gt;would include its Nokia 8.3 5G&lt;/a&gt; from last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the film is also set to include the Nokia 7.2, which was first released in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TxVBgJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMQ7JEk-Ydw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQsdlE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports that the movie could face reshoots to hide its outdated products, and quotes a source as saying that some scenes may be “carefully edited.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNPAB1"&gt;“The big tech firms want the stars to have all the new up-and-coming products to help promote them and sell them to fans,” the source tells &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;. “It means some of the scenes are going to have to be very carefully edited and looked at to bring things up to date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uz1wHN"&gt;We may have already seen an example of this kind of editing at work. Although one of the film’s stars, Lashana Lynch, appears to be using a Nokia 8.3 5G in the ad above (note the camera flash to the left of the array), a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM3kPYj_Grw"&gt;previous version released in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; seems to feature a Nokia 5.3, complete with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and headphone jack on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O862jl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; was originally due to release in April 2020 but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164789/james-bond-no-time-to-die-movie-delayed-coronavirus"&gt;delayed to November&lt;/a&gt; last year after the pandemic forced cinemas around the world to close. The film was subsequently delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;to April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;then to October 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Provided no more delays happen, the movie is currently slated to release around a year and a half after its original planned debut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q3GDv"&gt;Thankfully for HMD, there’s at least one phone in the film that’s unlikely to date too much. &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-discusses-her-key-role-in-the-new-bond-movie"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; will also feature a classic Nokia 3310, a phone that originally released way back in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVCS6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU group calls for Nintendo Switch Joy-Con drift investigation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q882RJw3ztuag1IOXsBzxSMnXWM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726936/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0148.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4AtEi8"&gt;The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) is calling on the European Commission to investigate Nintendo Joy-Con drift complaints. The BEUC group represents more than 40 consumer organizations across the European Union, and the umbrella organization says it has received nearly 25,000 complaints from consumers across Europe about faulty Joy-Con controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSC626"&gt;“According to consumer testimonies, in 88 percent of cases, the game controllers broke within the first two years of use,” &lt;a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-launches-europe-wide-complaint-against-nintendo-premature-obsolescence/html"&gt;says the BEUC&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-27-after-25k-complaints-eu-calls-for-investigation-into-nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The group has now submitted a complaint to the European Commission claiming Nintendo is involved in premature obsolescence and “misleading omissions of key consumer information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pdQkx"&gt;Nintendo Switch owners have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;reporting issues with the console’s removable Joy-Con controllers&lt;/a&gt; ever since its launch nearly four years ago. Most of the reports have centered around strange joystick drifting problems that create false inputs. Nintendo will repair the drifting Joy-Con controllers for free, but even the refreshed Switch models are experiencing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cgJm6M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Nintendo Switch’s Joy-Con drift problem, explained ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C7ZzY5"&gt;“BEUC and its members are very concerned about Nintendo continuing to sell a product that was continuously reported to Nintendo and in the media by consumers as failing prematurely,” says Ursula Pachl, deputy director general at the BEUC, in a letter to the European Commission. “The obsolescence of the product means that consumers often have to buy a new set of game controllers after a short time, also because of the unproportionate costs and the practical burdens that consumers would face when trying to exercise repairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0GxDm"&gt;The European Commission will now need to decide whether to open up a formal investigation into the Joy-Con drift issues. Nintendo is also facing two potential class action lawsuits. One was &lt;a href="https://chimicles.com/cskd-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-nintendo-of-america-inc-relating-to-joy-con-drifting-issues/"&gt;filed&lt;/a&gt; by law firm Chimicles Schwartz Kriner &amp;amp; Donaldson-Smith in 2019, and a second was &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-joy-con-lawsuit/"&gt;filled in California&lt;/a&gt; over the same issue in October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton Bike Plus: an upgrade at a crucial time</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The bike arrives at a time when many people want to work out at home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sOTOiJ"&gt;Last year was the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the year sweatpants become acceptable workwear, and the year Peloton peaked. Mid-pandemic, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427003/peloton-new-treadmill-bike-plus-exercise-equipment-features-price"&gt;announced two new devices&lt;/a&gt;: the pricier Bike Plus and a less expensive treadmill called the Tread. The Bike Plus started shipping in September and includes significant updates to the company’s signature hardware during an especially critical time when many people have shifted their fitness routines from gyms into their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIbsdg"&gt;I, for years, have been a dedicated Crunch gym-goer, usually taking five classes a week. But with gyms closing off and on and classes generally being canceled, I moved my routine indoors. First, I started with Peloton’s app workouts, using resistance bands and bodyweight. I then switched to Zoom classes taught by an instructor I enjoy from Crunch. For the past few months, I’ve been testing Peloton’s Bike Plus. To put it simply: I’ve loved my time with the Bike Plus. It’s become an important tool for my well-being. Anytime I need to sweat out stress or transition my day from work into leisure, the bike is my go-to. Peloton has built a truly reliable spin bike, but at $2,495, the price is still hard for me to accept, especially considering its ecosystem lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MK681C"&gt;The main thing to keep in mind when assessing Peloton’s products is that you’re paying solely for new hardware. The Peloton software remains the same across both the old and new internet-connected bikes, similar to how most old and new iPhones receive the current iOS. You can also access that app content without any official Peloton equipment. To get people to upgrade, though, Peloton has to offer real hardware innovation in order to justify the Bike Plus’ nearly $2,500 price versus the original bike’s $1,895 cost. This time around, for the extra $600, riders get a new swiveling display, a fresh speaker system, automatic resistance calibration, and Apple Watch GymKit support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bv3MId"&gt;Before fully assessing the bike investment, though, let’s first break the Bike Plus down by what’s new and how those features work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZVhsT8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10291963"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Cuqh0A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THAT SWIVEL DISPLAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gUSPnm"&gt;The most obvious change with the Bike Plus is the new 23.8-inch HD touchscreen. The prior model included a 21.5-inch HD touchscreen with thick bezels on all sides. It effectively looked like an iMac bolted to a stationary bike. The Bike Plus places a speaker across the top of the display, augmenting those bezels. To be clear: there are definitely still bezels on the new display, but they feel unobtrusive. It’s a massive screen solely for workout content, and your attention is firmly planted at the center of the screen most of the time. However, for a display this size and at this high of a cost, its lack of an ambient light sensor is questionable. I work out at various hours of the day but particularly love an evening ride in a dark room. The screen should dim itself rather than me having to manually do so. (There’s a camera at the top of the display for video calls with friends, so it could easily detect light.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Xwqy"&gt;As for the new swivel function, the main idea is people can take Peloton’s floor classes without having to uncomfortably stand behind their bikes. You can swivel the display out and away from the bike to face the rest of the room, allowing you to move around to complete yoga, strength, or meditation classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otfays"&gt;Peloton also launched a new class format, called Bike Bootcamp, to coincide with this bike’s release. The bootcamp is designed to give cyclers a chance to do it all — bike and strength train within the same class — without having to complete two separate workouts. And while the swivel display makes this option feasible, I still found these classes difficult to pull off for the first few weeks, namely because of the Peloton cycling shoes. When you ride on a Peloton, you clip into the bike with cycling shoes, and these shoes take time to clip out of the pedals, which requires lots of practice. For context, the Peloton employee who delivered my bike recommended leaving my shoes in the pedals and slipping my foot in and out to avoid a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yrv8r4"&gt;Bike Bootcamp classes expect you to clip in and out to complete various portions of the class, which took me a while to get used to doing. Adding to the quick transition stress was the lack of a pause button, meaning that I often missed the demo portion of the strength routine and fell behind. Peloton says the missing pause button is because the bike is “designed to give you a great workout and ensure that you work as hard as you would in a live indoor cycling class,” but in a home context, it’s more of a pain than anything else. You can exit the class, but this means you’ll have to reenter it, which takes a while and is annoying to do. And if you accidentally tap that you want to restart the class entirely, there’s no forward or back button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoBuH4"&gt;I also found the angling of the display to be slightly off. Working out on a mat means you want the display to tip as far down as possible to provide a good view of the content. But this display doesn’t angle far enough down, meaning I had to crane my neck to see the instructor. This didn’t prevent me from using the screen for mat workouts, but it did annoy me (and kind of hurt!) at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWH9Ka"&gt;Still, the swivel is an essential upgrade, especially if you use your bike’s display as your main one for other workouts. I don’t have a TV, so I need the swivel, but Peloton also offers a &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041841611-How-Do-I-Get-Peloton-Classes-On-My-TV-"&gt;suite of options&lt;/a&gt; for broadcasting to a TV, including a Roku app, Fire TV app, and AirPlay and Cast compatibility. If you have any of these options available to you in your home gym, the swivel screen likely won’t do much for you and isn’t worth the upgrade cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BiBiABtEGGL5uBZKDkJ5QXlGt_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233857/akrales210108_4344_0103.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f9gaFI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE NEW SPEAKER SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfiyau"&gt;The new bike comes with 26-watt, front-facing stereo speakers, as well as woofers that face away from you. The prior bike only included rear-facing stereo speakers. The new speakers sound great, although I preferred to bike with Bluetooth-paired wireless earbuds. (There’s also a headphone jack for anyone who might want wired options.) Peloton lets you select between different audio mixes, either prioritizing the music, the instructor, or finding a balance between the two in the original mix. I always work out with the music prioritized and when I do this through my AirPods Pro, I have no problem also hearing the instructor. But when I listen through the speaker, I find the music mix to be almost unusable; I sometimes can’t hear the instructor at all and miss my cues. The music is loud and sounds fantastic, which is perhaps what Peloton wanted, but finding the perfect balance between thumping music and hearing directions was complicated. (I’ll also note here that the bike is remarkably silent. My roommate would ride next to my bedroom door, and I couldn’t hear anything apart from his breathing. It’s a great bike for a shared home where people want to exist in their own spaces.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f31vmS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTOMATIC RESISTANCE DETECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2taNZa"&gt;This feature is undeniably cool. Typically, in a spin class, the instructor offers a range within which the riders should aim to set their resistance level. Spinners reach down to their resistance knob and turn it to the desired resistance whenever a new range is called out. The Bike Plus now adjusts the resistance automatically. It’s slick and convenient and absolutely the neatest feature of the Bike Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wplIhZ"&gt;I did encounter some bugs, though. Sometimes the cues were off, either with the resistance setting itself between a different range than the instructor called out, the timing of that resistance change being off, or the resistance dropping at times when it should have stayed consistent or even increased. This seemed to happen more frequently in older archive classes than new ones. With that said, though, the few times I ran into this problem weren’t a huge issue. I adjusted the knob myself and waited for the bike to catch the next instruction. I still find this feature hugely helpful, allowing me to concentrate more on the class rather than adjusting the knob to get to the right resistance, especially during climbs when the resistance can go up suddenly during an energy push.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S3VRwv8ozP_jIknCUUM5xS3PH-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233856/akrales210108_4344_0053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DLisKi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APPLE WATCH GYMKIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uIy6SR"&gt;The Bike Plus is also the first device from Peloton to directly integrate with the Apple Watch through GymKit. I had a couple of problems with this functionality at first: the Watch wouldn’t pair with the bike, but then Peloton issued an update which seemed to correct the issue. Only one other time did I have a problem with pairing and had to restart my Apple Watch. Although these issues only came up a couple of times, they were particularly upsetting because when the bike is paired with the Apple Watch, your heart rate shows up on-screen during a workout, which I look to monitor as I’m moving through a class. With the Apple Watch paired, workouts are also tracked in Apple’s Health app with all the bike’s own data taken into account, like energy output, so the functionality not working 100 percent of the time is frustrating and actively takes away from my exercise. But on the whole, it’s remained mostly reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SuwXG"&gt;The watch only directly syncs with the bike for spin or bike bootcamp workouts, meaning you won’t be able to see your heart-rate on the screen while you complete a strength or pilates class, for example. This isn’t great and feels like it defeats the purpose of having GymKit compatibility in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="higHxH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IS THIS THE BIKE FOR YOU?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqfs5U"&gt;The Bike Plus is an expensive, tough sell for Peloton and one that needs to be pulled off flawlessly, especially as new software competitors, like Apple Fitness Plus, enter the market, as well as cheaper hardware competitors like Echelon and Bowflex. The Bike Plus feels like the iPhone of spin bikes — it’s intuitive to use and works right out of the box. (But actually, there is no box because Peloton offers white glove delivery and setup with every purchase.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3X8sBk"&gt;For the person who doesn’t want to fiddle with a bike that isn’t totally built for Peloton’s software, meaning it doesn’t monitor output and all the other fancy fitness metrics, Peloton’s bikes are tempting. But buying one means committing to a $39-per-month subscription. The app itself only costs $12 per month but doesn’t include multi-account support, live classes, the leaderboard, and full metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDqAwg"&gt;For some people, that $39 is a savings compared to what they used to spend for gym access, especially considering it provides access to an unlimited number of different profiles. For others, it’s a significant investment in their health and life. Either way, you’re committing to Peloton and its subscription plan forever. The display is useless without the subscription, meaning if you ever wanted to try Apple Fitness Plus or SoulCycle or any other on-demand cycling classes, you’d have to ignore the massive display and instead get a TV or laptop to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDI7K0MIG6xmgDlIIGXHy9URafg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233851/akrales210108_4344_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MGRmJ3"&gt;As much as I loved my time with the Bike Plus, the high price and software lock-in is difficult to accept. Peloton has built undeniably great hardware. I just wish I could use it with any software I liked rather than only Peloton’s app. If I had a TV, this might bother me less because I’d plan to use whatever fitness app I liked on my TV and wouldn’t sweat losing the subscription. Although, of course, I’d then be saddled with a massive HD display that literally does nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41wJwr"&gt;The question of whether I’d recommend this bike depends on how much you love Peloton’s classes and how much you want to work for your exercise bike. Other spin bikes exist, many of which are cheaper and allow you to swap in your own tablet. You can even use Peloton’s app with them, albeit with some compromises, like losing your place on Peloton’s competitive leaderboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1DANN"&gt;There’s also Peloton’s notorious delivery delays to consider. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/business/peloton-slow-delivery.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that buyers’ delivery dates are being rescheduled day-of with the actual equipment showing up months after the date they were first quoted. All of this is to say, if you’re considering this bike purely for pandemic workouts, prepare to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7R2Oe8"&gt;Still, to me, the Bike Plus is a must-get for anyone who lives the true Peloton lifestyle and sees themselves loving the company and its software far into the future. It’s reliable, works well, and, broadly, my gripes didn’t take away from the experience; I’ve been riding nearly daily for months now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Db1WCH"&gt;I just can’t predict whether I’ll want to go back to the gym post-pandemic or if I’ll get used to working out at home indefinitely. To Peloton’s credit, however, I can’t imagine myself readily giving this bike back; it’ll hurt a little to watch it leave. That feels like a victory for the brand and an admission for me that I do want a Peloton bike in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra is first with new power efficient OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X05E1VQO6Wexse-pPTai86o76kU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726594/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQ5yMC"&gt;Samsung’s latest flagship, the Galaxy S21 Ultra, is its first phone to feature Samsung Display’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005831/en/Samsung-Display-Unveils-New-Low-power-OLED-Display-for-Smartphones/"&gt;new power-efficient OLED panels&lt;/a&gt;. In a press release, Samsung says the new display consumes 16 percent less power thanks to a “just-developed organic material” that means “electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz8udY"&gt;“In other words,” Samsung explains, the technology means its “OLED panels can create brighter light while consuming less power, which improves the battery lifetime.” A smartphone’s display is typically one of its most power-hungry components, so efficiency gains here can have a big impact on the overall battery life of the device. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we remarked that the S21 Ultra has excellent battery life that lasts “beyond a full day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OYpiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Electrons flow faster and more easily across the display’s organic layer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="58fMXQ"&gt;Samsung confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the S21 Ultra uses an LTPO (aka a &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) display, but it’s not the first of Samsung’s phones to do so. Last year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=1334"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra also used LTPO display panels, which Samsung brands as HOP (Hybrid Oxide and Polycrystalline silicon). However, this week’s announcement says the S21 Ultra is the “first” to use the more efficient panels, suggesting Samsung Display has further refined the technology compared to the Note 20 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyJDW9"&gt;Prior to appearing in smartphones, LTPO displays have been used in smart watches. &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Apple Watch Series 4 featured an LTPO display produced by LG, while Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 used an LTPO display produced by Samsung Display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONy3Zk"&gt;If reports are accurate, Apple’s next flagship iPhones could soon benefit from Samsung Display’s power-efficient panel technology. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the South Korean company is in line to supply LTPO panels for Apple’s 2021 iPhones. According to the report, Apple will use 120Hz LTPO OLED displays in two of its four iPhones in the second half of the year, while the other two will have more traditional OLED panels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime adds electric mopeds to its lineup of scooters and bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihBjCSwQtGAbE8nHHaJ-VXCTURQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726512/LIME_SAN_FRANCISCO_STREET_DREAMS_120.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tloU4k"&gt;Lime is adding a new member to its family of shared electric vehicles: mopeds. The mopeds are being offered as part of a pilot program to test whether Lime’s customers prefer vehicles that are faster, heavier, and arguably riskier to ride than your average kick scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97eUBz"&gt;The mopeds can be rented via Lime’s smartphone app, just like the company’s e-scooters. Lime is still finalizing the price per mile for the mopeds, but it intends for it to be competitive with other shared mobility services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kO0rNR"&gt;&lt;q&gt; Lime insists its pilot will presage a larger rollout in the spring&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHQfpf"&gt;Other scooter companies have flirted with expanding their product lineups to include mopeds, but Lime insists its pilot will presage a larger rollout in the spring. To start, Lime will be introducing mopeds in the coming months in just two cities: Washington, DC and Paris. The company plans to spread 600 mopeds around the US capital, while the number that will be rolling out in Paris is still to be determined. The mopeds will likely start hitting the streets in early March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7bd7K"&gt;The mopeds are manufactured by NIU, a Chinese company that also supplies mopeds to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;New York City-based mobility company Revel&lt;/a&gt;. NIU’s mopeds typically get between 25–100 miles of range. Lime’s mopeds will be speed limited to 28 mph and can be controlled and monitored via wireless connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jd1aldmcboItZ_ec3z5LRItdR9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261395/LIME_SAN_FRANCISCO_STREET_DREAMS_116.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X3RiEN"&gt;The mopeds are intended to lend credibility to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;Lime’s claims of being more than just another scooter company&lt;/a&gt;. The company sees itself as a “platform” for different types of low-speed, electric-powered mobility. Last year, Lime added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506805/lime-wheels-app-integrate-scooter-bike-mobility"&gt;pedal-less e-bikes from Wheels&lt;/a&gt; to its app in several cities as part of a new effort to integrate third-party micromobility providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCC1QX"&gt;Lime CEO Wayne Ting claims his company is “the first micromobility provider to offer three vehicles on one platform.” (Gotcha, a 12-year-old company based in Charleston, South Carolina, previously offered electric kick scooters, seated scooters, bikes, and trikes on its platform. The company was recently acquired by another scooter company called Bolt.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3bH2N"&gt;Mopeds are arguably a faster way to get around, but they can also be more dangerous, especially for novice riders. Revel was forced to temporarily shut down its service in New York City last year after two customers were killed and one was critically injured while riding the shared electric mopeds. The company eventually resumed service with &lt;a href="https://gorevel.com/safety/"&gt;new protective measures for riders&lt;/a&gt; like a mandatory in-app safety test and a requirement that all riders take a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before they’ll be allowed to ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tikmd"&gt;Lime is hoping to avoid a similar tragedy by embracing a number of safety measures right out the gate. Riders will be required to take a multichapter rider safety course, developed in partnership with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. The test has been “optimized for learning retention,” Lime says, and must be completed before any user can begin a ride. Customers will only be required to have a driver's license — not a motorcycle license — in order to ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dxrjdt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime is hoping to avoid tragedy by embracing a number of safety measures right out the gate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta4yd7"&gt;Each moped also comes with two helmets, one big and one small, which are locked away in a cargo compartment at the back. Lime will have three different checkpoints to ensure riders can’t get away with cruising off without wearing a helmet. Riders will be required to take a selfie of themselves wearing the helmet, and there will be a prompt in the app to confirm the helmet is being worn. Also, the helmet compartment includes an infrared sensor that can confirm whether the helmet has been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TE1aY"&gt;Helmets will be cleaned every time a member of Lime’s operations staff handles the moped — which will likely amount to once every three days or so. Lime will also offer head covers in each helmet for extra protection. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bJ_6bQt3HKEf97UAHGeHcejc398=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261399/LIME_SAN_FRANCISCO_STREET_DREAMS_119.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3od3Zx"&gt;Lime will also provide free 45-minute in-person lessons for all riders, taught by certified motorcycle instructors in small class sizes. According to the company, the lessons are designed to help riders get comfortable with maneuvers such as braking, turning, and parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUFzOK"&gt;“Lime will take strict enforcement measures for repeat safety violators, including removal from the platform, to avoid putting themselves and other road users at risk,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xU8K2X"&gt;Lime isn’t the first scooter company to dabble in mopeds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;Bird introduced moped-style e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, likely made by California-based e-bike company Juiced, in Los Angeles in 2019 and Austin in 2020. Also in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916749/uber-electric-moped-cityscoot-paris"&gt;Uber teamed up with French startup Cityscoot&lt;/a&gt; to integrate around 4,000 of the company’s mopeds into Uber’s app in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social justice groups warn Biden against throwing out Section 230</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-HEALTH-BIDEN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WG7dWOVczJQwyxLk4BOc1ZWJSP4=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726516/1230806569.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g1nZ6m"&gt;A group of 75 activist groups and nonprofits have &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261662/Section_230_Letter__Jan_27__2021___1_.pdf"&gt;urged against sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, warning that it could silence marginalized communities while making online moderation harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUxHzo"&gt;“Section 230 is a foundational law for free expression and human rights when it comes to digital speech,” the letter says. The law protects websites and apps from being sued over user-generated content — making it safer to operate social networks, comment sections, or hosting services. “Overly broad changes to Section 230 could disproportionately harm and silence marginalized people, whose voices have been historically ignored by mainstream press outlets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq3jsh"&gt;The letter is signed by a variety of groups supporting racial justice, sex workers’ rights, and free speech online — including the Wikimedia Foundation, Fight for the Future, and the Sex Workers Outreach Project. It’s addressed to Congress and the administration of President Joe Biden, both of which have shown an appetite for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250746/biden-gina-raimondo-commerce-secretary-section-230"&gt;changing Section 230&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="JCbK9T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9149651"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYt8gj"&gt;To demonstrate the potential harm of major changes, the authors point to FOSTA-SESTA, a 2018 rule that removed legal protections for hosting prostitution-related content. “The impacts of this law were immediate and destructive, limiting the accounts of sex workers and making it more difficult to find and help those who were being trafficked online,” they write. They’re calling to pass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026787/sesta-fosta-congress-study-hhs-sex-work-ro-khanna-elizabeth-warren-ron-wyden"&gt;a 2019 proposal&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who called for a study of how the law impacted sex workers. At least one independent survey, performed by the signatory Hacking//Hustling, &lt;a href="https://hackinghustling.org/erased-the-impact-of-fosta-sesta-2020/"&gt;found a negative effect&lt;/a&gt; on many participants’ safety and financial stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfbwim"&gt;The letter also notes that Section 230 lets companies remove objectionable posts without fear of lawsuits from disgruntled users. Amazon, for instance, invoked it to defend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;suspending the social network Parler&lt;/a&gt; over violent threats. “Congress should act to address the harms of Big Tech through meaningful legislative action on data privacy, civil rights and others fronts, and enforcement of existing antitrust laws. But uncareful efforts to poke holes in Section 230 could result in the exact opposite outcome,” write the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i57xYY"&gt;The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies"&gt;pushed to rewrite Section 230&lt;/a&gt;, aiming to discourage social media sites from removing or fact-checking former President Donald Trump’s posts as well as other conservative content. Several Republican lawmakers backed similar changes. The incoming Biden administration also appears critical of Section 230, but on opposite grounds since Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274812/joe-biden-donald-trump-twitter-facebook-section-230-moderation-revoke"&gt;claimed the law&lt;/a&gt; allows companies like Facebook to host false information. (The First Amendment protects many false statements.) Gina Raimondo, Biden’s nominee for Commerce Department secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250746/biden-gina-raimondo-commerce-secretary-section-230"&gt;expressed support&lt;/a&gt; yesterday for changing the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMNL6M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei’s next company is literally called Nothing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TibWq3zZOyTwJ-yAN7-aX9IsVwI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68726486/Nothing_RGB_Signalweiss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing’s official logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vfcHH"&gt;Carl Pei, the OnePlus co-founder who parted ways with the company last year, has announced the name of his next venture: Nothing. It describes itself as a “London based consumer technology company” and counts the likes of iPod inventor Tony Fadell, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, and YouTuber Casey Neistat as investors. It plans to release its first “smart devices” in the first half of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngvnGY"&gt;“Nothing’s mission is to remove barriers between people and technology to create a seamless digital future,” says Pei, Nothing’s founder and CEO, in a press release. “We believe that the best technology is beautiful, yet natural and intuitive to use. When sufficiently advanced, it should fade into the background and feel like nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7E7WAtfVMFyafAtcMcBZ9W5rrF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260889/DSCF6741.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carl Pei, who previously co-founded the smartphone brand OnePlus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9EbaVJ"&gt;What’s unclear at the moment is exactly what products Nothing plans to release. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; ahead of today’s announcement, Pei declined to offer specific details on what form Nothing’s first “smart devices” will take. He also declined to say which companies Nothing plans to compete with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyeohh"&gt;Pei does confirm, however, that Nothing plans to release products across multiple categories, with the eventual aim of building up an ecosystem of devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMBfO1"&gt;“Right now... the team is being built, so we want to focus on simpler categories,” Pei says, “but as our team gains capabilities and skills we want to start moving up. The ultimate vision of having everything connected in a seamless way, that can only happen when you have multiple categories of products that are connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA1sQN"&gt;During Pei’s tenure at OnePlus, the company released everything from smartphones to headphones and even TVs. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/carl-pei-oneplus-next-project"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Pei’s new company could focus on music and might include manufacturing headphones. When asked, Pei declined to confirm whether headphones would be among Nothing’s early products. When asked by &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, he said the company’s plans were “so much more than that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pieozJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A completely independent company owned by our founding team and our investors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ENq0FL"&gt;While there’s been speculation that this could point toward Nothing developing an accompanying music service, Pei tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Nothing plans to make most of its money by selling hardware rather than software subscriptions, at least initially. “We haven’t spent too much time thinking about the software portion of it,” Pei says. “It definitely needs to be a good user experience if you are to generate revenue from software.” In the long term, however, he admits that a “healthy business” requires both good hardware and good software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCyxhI"&gt;Pei’s new company plans to differentiate itself by using “custom made” components in its products right from the start. Pei suggests this will stop Nothing’s products from looking too much like its competitors. “There’s a reason why a lot of products on the market look quite similar,” Pei observes. “It’s because they share a lot of the same components and the same building blocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9m0ZCD"&gt;In contrast, OnePlus’ phones have faced frequent criticism over the years for the similarities they’ve shared with Oppo’s phones. In a recent video, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9EOAEWC9hJ4?t=221"&gt;Marques Brownlee outlined&lt;/a&gt; a series of Oppo and OnePlus devices with strikingly similar hardware, like the OnePlus 5 and Oppo R11, the OnePlus 6T and Oppo R17, and the OnePlus Nord N100 and Oppo A53. The two brands even use similar fast-charging technologies. OnePlus has Dash Charge, and Oppo has VOOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LVpC0M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We rethought everything and came up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nothing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Nothing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VSz905Kgug"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VSz905Kgug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nothing (@nothingtech) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nothingtech/status/1354385671956418560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CEJF1q"&gt;While OnePlus and Oppo are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/15/17467348/oneplus-6-vs-oppo-r15-pro-vivo-bbk"&gt;widely reported&lt;/a&gt; to exist under the same Chinese corporate giant BBK Electronics, Pei says Nothing is unencumbered by such an arrangement. “[Nothing is] a completely independent company owned by our founding team and our investors,” says Pei, with its own R&amp;amp;D department. And despite using contract manufacturers to build its devices, Pei says Nothing won’t just “relabel somebody else’s products.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qz8pyT"&gt;But while Pei hopes Nothing’s early products will feature “differentiated” designs without feeling “different for the sake of being different,” the eventual hope is for them to fade into the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlF5RU"&gt;“I kind of envision a grass field with people having a picnic and there’s no screen, there’s no laptop screen, there’s no phone screen, there’s no smartwatch screen, there’s no billboard screen,” Pei muses. “That’s kind of the end state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMnQb5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; columnist Walt Mossberg referred this future state as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15686870/walt-mossberg-final-column-the-disappearing-computer"&gt;ambient computing&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Pei admits that it may take 20 or 30 years to arrive, but he says the future his company is aiming for is one where its technology resembles… well, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Watch 3’s EKG feature is coming to 31 new countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWYcTEqvRCXr3PJkU6QsZeu_8Lo=/0x0:5417x3611/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68725515/dseifert_200811_4139_0019.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZWu26"&gt;Samsung is expanding its Health Monitor app &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-vital-blood-pressure-and-electrocardiogram-tracking-to-galaxy-watch3-and-galaxy-watch-active2-in-31-more-countries"&gt;to 31 new countries&lt;/a&gt;, including 28 European countries, and people in those countries will be able to use the app with a Galaxy Watch 3 or Galaxy Active 2 smartwatch to take electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood pressure readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPWDVS"&gt;Samsung says the app was granted a CE marking in December, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking"&gt;which means&lt;/a&gt; that it complies with applicable regulations in Europe and can be offered in the European Economic Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NN2zhG"&gt;Here is the full list of countries in Europe that will soon be able to get the app: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. It will also be available in Chile, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCH23I"&gt;To be able to take an EKG or blood pressure measurement, you’ll need to have the Samsung Health Monitor app installed on your Galaxy smartphone and on a Galaxy Watch 3 or Galaxy Active 2. Samsung says the app update that enables the features will begin rolling out on February 4th, though the company notes that availability “may vary by market and carrier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYM64j"&gt;Apple introduced the ability to take an EKG with the Apple Watch Series 4 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128209/apple-watch-electrocardiogram-ecg-irregular-heart-rate-features-available-health-monitor"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though Apple Watches still can’t natively track blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI is now selling a warranty to replace your drone if it flies away</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jJXdKmFCdr_5kBlFUYQwZQEJVNg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68725387/vpavic_042029_4003_0171.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRihfv"&gt;DJI is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fguides%2Fdji-care-refresh-flyaway-coverage%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook_organic%26utm_campaign%3DBG-2021%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26fbclid%3DIwAR2nek-sMLJ1LF9GEnrjsl-Qr3VUBaP3pxNK5Vhh4fH_Mi9tFkpYPlz5Aic&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22251294%2Fdji-mavic-air-mini-2-flyaway-replacement-warranty#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now offering flyaway coverage&lt;/a&gt; for its Mini 2 and Mavic Air 2 drones, should they develop a mind of their own and take off. The cost of replacing the escaped drone is $225 for the Mini, and $399 for the Mavic, which is on top of the price of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fservice%2Fdjicare-refresh%2Finfo%23faq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22251294%2Fdji-mavic-air-mini-2-flyaway-replacement-warranty#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI’s Care Refresh extended warranty&lt;/a&gt;. For that, you’ll pay $50 for the Mini, and $80 for the Mavic. If you already own one of these drones and the extended warranty, you’re eligible for flyway replacements going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zX7E1f"&gt;The extended warranty also lets you replace your drone if you damage it, twice per year, for $50 each. For flyaway coverage, there’s a one-time limit — if your replacement also goes AWOL, you’ll be on the hook to replace it, though there is a two-year version of the warranty that costs more and covers three accidents and two flyaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4ef1P"&gt;At half the price of a new drone, the replacement costs are rather high compared to something like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fproducts%2Fiphone%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22251294%2Fdji-mavic-air-mini-2-flyaway-replacement-warranty#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AppleCare Plus with Theft and Loss&lt;/a&gt;, which only charges $149 to replace a lost or stolen iPhone. DJI’s coverage doesn’t cover you if your drone gets lost or stolen, only if it’s taken by the sky, but it also costs less to start: adding Theft and Loss coverage to an iPhone 12 &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/13/iphone-12-iphone-12-mini-applecare-costs-149-199-for-iphone-12-pro-models"&gt;is $219, or $269 for an iPhone 12 Pro, for example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSF3R6"&gt;Of course, you would hope that the drones would simply not fly away on their own in the first place. On the announcement page, DJI says that “some accidents are inevitable when flying in complex environments, or in locations with signal interference, strong winds, or obstructed views.&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;If I were buying an expensive drone, I would hope that it would know what to do in most of those situations (though wind does seem like a valid factor in a flyaway event.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jNVxP"&gt;It seems like DJI has made progress in this regard, though — Googling “drone flyaway” brings up several stories from 2018 and before, but they seem to be less frequent nowadays. Still, if you’re worried about losing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21243887/dji-mavic-air-2-2020-drone-flight-photography-video-review-price-specs-features"&gt;your nice drone&lt;/a&gt;, it’s good to have more options, should it ever decide to slip the surly bonds of Earth to visit the great drone factory in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bloodhound’s 1,000 mph rocket car being sold for $11 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rWlzPUyAUXb_2FmuA1SruT0F7aU=/491x0:5795x3536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724921/BLOODHOUND_LSR_Charlie_Sperring__IMGL5805.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bloodhound LSR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPOhpa"&gt;For sale: a rocket-powered car named Bloodhound built specifically to break the land speed record. Theoretical top speed of 1,000 miles per hour. Seats one. Price? A paltry $11 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6eobx"&gt;The tortured saga of the Bloodhound Land Speed Record project has reached a sadly predictable impasse: the current owner is done spending money trying to set a new record after saving the project from bankruptcy in 2018. It’s hard to blame him. The Bloodhound program has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9384963/bloodhound-ssc-supersonic-rocket-car-photos"&gt;been going for the better part of a decade at this point&lt;/a&gt; and has yet to break the 763 mile-per-hour record, let alone scratch at the group’s ultimate stated goal of 1,000 miles per hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvZDUi"&gt;The Bloodhound still needs the actual rocket in order to make its full-speed runs, too, despite hitting 628 miles per hour in a late-2019 test. (It’s currently jet engine powered.) The pandemic killed the project’s momentum, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1hgKR"&gt;“Work now needs to restart in the next few months to get ready for a 2022 record attempt,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloodhoundlsr.com/800-mph-bloodhound-lsr-project-for-sale/"&gt;a blog post on the Bloodhound website reads&lt;/a&gt;. “The alternative would be to put the car into long-term storage, with no certainty of being able to restart the project. As the prospect of a post-Covid world beckons, the Bloodhound team now needs to find a new owner to continue its ‘engineering adventure’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HtV9SW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$11 million is a lot of money, but it’s also not? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBgqzv"&gt;Don’t get me wrong — $11 million is a lot of money to most people. But in many parts of the economy right now, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-jerome-powell-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-db97a4aeb224f3f8e7fa85a9e0bd7fb1"&gt;money is nearly free&lt;/a&gt;. In the last half-year alone, for example, billions of dollars have been thrown at unproven automotive startups that have no chance of turning a profit anytime soon, thanks to the boom in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;mergers with special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt;, or SPACs. Why not a rocket car? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu8S0r"&gt;Bloodhound argues buyers could recoup their investment as long as a record attempt happens. The Bloodhound team says there is “significant” fundraising potential “as the record attempt gets closer” and that selling sponsorships and rights could generate cash in the short term. Perhaps there’s a SPAC out there willing to test this claim &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-bubble-may-burstand-not-a-day-too-soon-11609975529"&gt;before the inevitable SPAClash arrives&lt;/a&gt;? Or maybe &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/business/billionaire-wealth-inequality-poverty/index.html"&gt;the growing billionaire class would like to pitch in&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbbrCm"&gt;The gang behind the Bloodhound has a ways to go to beat the land speed record, but the project has been through so much that it’s hard to imagine things ending here. Scraping together another $11 million could be tricky, but it’s easier — and certainly less physically risky — than finding those last few hundred miles per hour. &lt;/p&gt;
