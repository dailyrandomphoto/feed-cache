    <title>Astronomers discover largest group of ‘rogue planets’ yet</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Wyjui"&gt;Astronomers &lt;a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2120/"&gt;just discovered&lt;/a&gt; a treasure trove of “rogue planets” — free-floating planets that don’t orbit a star but exist all by their lonesome in the depths of space. With masses comparable to that of Jupiter, the 70 or more rogue planets spotted throughout the Milky Way galaxy are the largest such group of cosmic nomads ever found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9kRn5"&gt;Located within the Scorpius and Ophiuchus constellations, the planets were spotted using a suite of telescopes on both the ground and in space. Typically, rogue planets are difficult to image because they aren’t close to any stars to make them visible. However, with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01513-x"&gt;data compiled&lt;/a&gt; over 20 years from European Southern Observatory (ESO) telescopes, the European Space Agency’s Gaia satellite, and more, Núria Miret-Roig, an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux, France and the University of Vienna, Austria, and her team were able to capture faint heat signatures emitted from planets that formed within the last several million years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaFTPt"&gt;The team published its findings on Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ts55QAUBg4UOF_sX_Y-PXwoEh1g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23122827/eso2120c.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Location of discovered rogue planets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D8AFIv"&gt;Despite the record-breaking observation, their findings suggest that far more rogue planets are waiting to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQqTs7"&gt;“There could be several billions of these free-floating giant planets roaming freely in the Milky Way without a host star,” Hervé Bouy, an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux, France and co-author on the study, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d30E0x"&gt;The discovery is a step toward figuring out how these mysterious objects form in space, according to an ESO press release. It’s possible rogue planets initially formed around stars before being violently ejected from their solar system. Alternatively, they could have formed from collapsing gas clouds too small to lead to the birth of a new star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNnVTz"&gt;Astronomers are currently awaiting completion of ESO’s &lt;a href="https://elt.eso.org/"&gt;Extremely Large Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (ELT), a giant observatory that will play a “crucial” part in finding further information about rogue planets, according to Bouy. The ELT is set to begin observations at the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkCxVw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest trailer for the Uncharted movie displays a borderline contempt for the laws of physics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/72xEEYES-XzFc6tSxRxU9jBtJu8=/458x0:1961x1002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70311197/Screen_Shot_2021_12_23_at_12.31.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADTH0z"&gt;Impossible as it once may have seemed, but &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;the long-awaited film adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the Naughty Dog game series) is actually set to hit movie theaters early next year, barring any other delays for the decade-in-the-making film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PD2sJ"&gt;The new trailer also gives a better idea of what to expect from the movie: as teased, the film is a spiritual prequel of sorts to the characters players know and love from the PlayStation games. Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is just at the start of his career as a globe-trotting treasure hunter (although the trailer already shows that he’ll be donning the character’s trademark henley and holsters by the end), while a ‘stache-less Sully (Mark Wahlberg) is his gateway to the world of thieves. The duo will be facing off against a new villain, Moncada (played on Antonio Banderas), squaring off to find $5 billion worth of loot from the explorer Magellan. Table stakes for an &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; storyline, really. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giAnpKLBpyirMrzPhCOp8SAKLKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23123001/Screen_Shot_2021_12_23_at_12.30.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pretty sure that’s not how boats or helicopters work&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mTE0aG"&gt;And while there are still some big question marks about how different &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;’s characters look from their game counterparts, the movie is clearly taking heavy inspiration from the series’ high-flying action sequences, with flying man of wars and a crate-hopping plane sequence inspired by &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xZUf6"&gt;Uncharted is set to hit theaters on February 18th, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822130/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-remaster-price-release-date-upgrade"&gt;Sony offering free tickets&lt;/a&gt; for customers who either buy or upgrade to the upcoming PS5 remaster of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s massive Odyssey G9 gaming monitor is down to its lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_yxY_zi1uXYrKs0vw-qq0a5zDnU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70311012/cfaulkner_210720_4672_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pbNqlB"&gt;With the current end-of-year promotion happening at B&amp;amp;H Photo, you can get the massive Samsung Odyssey G9 gaming monitor for its lowest price ever. This monitor’s list price is $1,599 and it typically retails around $1,500, but you can currently grab it for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1578217-REG%2Fsamsung_lc49g97tssnxdc_49_monitor_hdr_color.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F23%2F22850641%2Fodyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-razer-keyboard-smart-frames-epic-games-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggEtIsHp4q" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2F49-odyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-lc49g97tssnxdc%2Fp%2FN82E16824022902%3FItem%3DN82E16824022902" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This same discount is also available at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; when you check out using promo code &lt;strong&gt;YEAREND3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1jbJG"&gt;This curved 49-inch monitor sports a 1440p resolution and a blistering 240Hz refresh rate. The display is compatible with both AMD Freesync and Nvidia G-Sync to help cut down on screen tearing and comes equipped with a pair of Display Port and USB inputs, as well as a single HDMI port. The stand thankfully supports height, tilt, and swivel adjustments, so you shouldn’t have to make use of the 100x100 VESA mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NvRqk9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fXpTtS"&gt;With the days finally getting a little longer, investing in a pair of slick shades may not be a bad idea. At Best Buy, you can currently grab Razer’s Anzu smart frames in a variety of styles for a steep discount. These stylish shades typically retail for $199.99, but you can currently grab the rectangular, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggCYIA2EGa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wayfarer-inspired model for $129.99&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggCWz2kcyx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the more rounded version for just $99.99&lt;/a&gt;. Both models are available in either medium or large sizes and come packaged with blue-light filtering and tinted lenses. While prescription lenses don’t come packaged with the glasses, you &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.lensabl.com/Razer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can order them for a 15 percent discount at Lenabl&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code RAZER15 at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nv69h0"&gt;These smart frames have Bluetooth speakers integrated into both temples and touch-based playback controls that can also summon your device’s voice assistant capabilities. While they only have around five hours of battery life, the Anzu frames will automatically power off whenever they’re folded up, allowing you to get the most out of a single charge.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MibmEB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10945749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="oheHi5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10945754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KedrYU"&gt;Razer’s first 60 percent keyboard, the Huntsman Mini with clicky switches, is currently available at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=VergeBlackFridayPCDeals2021&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fdesktops-laptops%2Fkeyboards%2Fproducts%2Frazer-huntsman-mini-mercury-edition-60-percent-optical-purple-switches-wired-gaming-keyboard%2F221667.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $79.99. This is a solid $20 price break on this $100 gaming keyboard. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08B3JSKGR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The linear switch version is also available for $89.99&lt;/a&gt;. Just like other 60 percent keyboards, the Huntsman Mini eliminates the number pad entirely and consolidates the directional arrows and function row, reducing the footprint of this peripheral down to its bare essentials. Both the linear and clicky models are equipped with Razer’s optical switches, PBT keycaps, and a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QkCibv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0asrmZ"&gt;If you’re not quite ready to sacrifice that function row or need fewer wires in your life, you can currently find the linear, clicky, and tactile versions of Logitech’s tenkeyless G915 Lightspeed keyboard for $179.99 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Tenkeyless-Lightspeed-Mechanical-LIGHTSYNC/dp/B085RFFC9Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fdesktops-laptops%2Fkeyboards%2Fproducts%2Flogitech-g915-tkl-lightspeed-wireless-carbon-linear-switches-gaming-keyboard%2F259262.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. This discount knocks a healthy $50 off the regular $229.99 MSRP. This low-profile wireless keyboard can be paired either via Bluetooth or through the included 2.4GHz wireless dongle and can last up to 40 hours at maximum brightness. The keyboard can also remain tethered to your PC via a micro-USB connection if you’d prefer. In addition to the function row and directional keys, the G915 TKL also features dedicated media playback buttons and a volume scrolling wheel.    The one unfortunate oversight on this otherwise excellent keyboard is the lack of any PBT coating on the keycaps, which causes them to accumulate fingerprints and grease rather easily.&lt;/p&gt;

Normally, these noise-canceling earbuds would run you close to $229.99, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggCzR9bsv4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but they’ve been discounted to $139.99&lt;/a&gt;, beating out their best price by $10. The 85t’s are also available in &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggDGBK6f68" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggDGiHteGb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; colorways but are only discounted to $149.99. These earbuds feature excellent noise-cancellation, multi-point Bluetooth connectivity, and a comfortable fit. They can last up to seven hours on a single charge, and while the case itself supports wireless charging, it can also be topped off via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There are tons of great new titles being discounted, like &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Riders Republic&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;. Some titles are being discounted by as much as 75 percent, but nearly every title that costs more than $15 is eligible for an additional $10 off. Even if you’re not looking to spend money, the Epic Store is also providing a free game every 24 hours that’s yours to keep. The winter sale will be live until January 6th, which is plenty of time to cash in on these sweet deals. It’s also worth noting that the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Steam winter sale is currently live&lt;/a&gt;, so just in case the Epic storefront doesn’t have what you want on sale, it can likely be found for a discount there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where is Spotify HiFi?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2kETxhomBnZFKFxFSLWHVA7NFs0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310893/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b3QgbI"&gt;2021 will have been the year that Apple finally embraced lossless music streaming and prices for hi-fi listening came down at Amazon and Tidal. But the biggest subscription music service of all, Spotify, seems likely to miss its original target for launching a higher-quality streaming plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah5iHE"&gt;Spotify HiFi, first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;all the way back in February&lt;/a&gt;, has yet to roll out despite the company’s early estimate that it would debut “later this year.” At the time, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-22/five-things-to-know-about-spotify-hifi/"&gt;Spotify said HiFi would be available in select markets&lt;/a&gt; and that the company would “have more details to share soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VNL0s"&gt;Over the next 10 months, those details never came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy4yF7"&gt;Meanwhile, Spotify’s competitors didn’t wait around. Apple Music rolled out lossless and hi-res playback in June, offering the improved audio quality at no extra charge. Before that shift, services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Tidal had been demanding an added premium for the feature. But on the same day that Apple announced its plans for lossless streaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;Amazon said it would ditch the higher subscription price&lt;/a&gt; and include HD quality as part of the regular premium plan. It’s officially table stakes now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUL3wP"&gt;There have been occasional signs of Spotify HiFi throughout the year; a “HiFi” button could (very briefly) be spotted in the app back in May — complete with explainers on using the feature. And an onboarding video for HiFi &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWq5CFQ5gng"&gt;was leaked in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u9ordr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spotify HiFi could be near.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Open the iOS app and QUICKLY maximize the song title bar at the bottom: see that “HiFi” icon that briefly appears at the bottom right corner? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you manage to tap it in time, it shows these explainer menus. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xAhdInzY7c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xAhdInzY7c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Welch (@chriswelch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswelch/status/1394474839793090562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3U1vN4"&gt;As 2021 stretched on, Spotify had a lot to say about podcasts but kept mum on the subject of HiFi and declined comment whenever &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked about its status. Barring a last-minute holiday surprise, it seems we’ll be waiting until sometime in 2022 for Spotify HiFi. Hugely popular platforms tend to avoid launching major new features at the tail end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5A2iOV"&gt;It’s possible that Spotify has had second thoughts about launching the feature — or at least is no longer in a rush to deliver it. You could argue that the company doesn’t need to bother with HiFi at all. Spotify already enjoys powerful mindshare with consumers for its playlist algorithms and user experience; the recent wave of Spotify Wrapped posts across social media was another fresh reminder of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YvE4c"&gt;Plus, there’s no longer any financial incentive. Apple has essentially forced Spotify’s hand to offer CD-quality streaming without wringing more money from customers. And if it’s not contributing to the bottom line, what’s the point? There’s also the possibility that Spotify ran into a legal quagmire in trying to update its music deals for HiFi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o28Ypf"&gt;
&lt;div class="reddit-embed" data-embed-media="www.redditmedia.com" data-embed-parent="false" data-embed-live="true" data-embed-uuid="90427e8e-640f-11ec-a4b3-82b6884be148" data-embed-created="2021-12-23T16:44:14.920027+00:00"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/rb451q/spotify_hifi_officially_dead/hno3l19/"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; from discussion &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/rb451q/spotify_hifi_officially_dead/"&gt;whackawhoroo's comment from discussion "Spotify HIFI Officially Dead?"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHhc8r"&gt;Lossless music is fundamentally a niche feature that’s at odds with how music is often consumed these days. In a world of Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, Apple and Amazon are far more interested in hyping spatial Dolby Atmos audio than higher-bitrate streams that only shine on expensive gear. Even then, some people just can’t distinguish it from the standard, lossy quality they’ve been listening to for years. Spotify has yet to confirm whether it too will offer Atmos tracks — or even hi-res audio that exceeds 16-bit/44.1kHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hObEZ"&gt;Personally, I still hope Spotify HiFi does eventually launch. There’s a significant ecosystem of speaker hardware that’s compatible with Spotify Connect, making it easier and more convenient to enjoy the extra fidelity. And as we progress further into the streaming era, it feels like the option to enjoy music at higher quality &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be there for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymMOTp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Spotify for an update on where things stand with HiFi as 2021 comes to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Take a look at this delicious lickable screen to see the future we knew was coming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1p6BztjpMYzdjQgU7wA9w2gCwrw=/177x0:2286x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310755/Screen_Shot_2021_12_23_at_10.31.40.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the menu. Taste the menu.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meiji University&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nyhtDX"&gt;If you’ve ever thought, “This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973993/tv-buying-guide-oled-qled-lcd-hdr-dolby-vision-atmos-nits-backlighting"&gt;4K HDR OLED TV is great&lt;/a&gt;, but I sure wish it tasted better when I licked it,” we may be getting closer to a world where that’s the case — a professor has created a device he calls “Taste the TV,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/lick-it-up-japan-professor-creates-tele-taste-tv-screen-2021-12-23/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it does exactly what the name implies. Homei Miyashita says he hopes his “TTTV” will let people experience things like far-away world-class restaurants without leaving their own home, which has become an increasingly understandable desire in the past two years of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWYAYV"&gt;According to a demonstration video, which you can see below, researchers blended up various foods and used sensors to “taste” them. Then, chemicals are sprayed onto a rolling plastic sheet (or a disposable tray for those who don’t feel comfortable licking a plastic-covered screen) in combinations that recreate the flavor. The sheet is then rolled out over the display so you can lick those sweet chemicals and rolled away once you’re done for easy disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="92SKN8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5Gu1WgqTTw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EY4yQd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hopefully, you enjoy the screen with your real tongue, though, rather than a demonstration one like they use in the video. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c62iMw"&gt;The video shows off all sorts of practical ideas for how TTTV could be used — as a menu that gives you an idea of what the food will taste like, a way to train wine testers, or a device that lets you add flavoring to crackers. But personally, I want to use it to taste things from movies or all those food TV shows I watch. Would it be a gimmick like 3D movies at home or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/30/14439362/samsung-curved-tv-review-un40k6250af-mistake"&gt;curved TVs&lt;/a&gt;? Almost certainly, but come on, who among us hasn’t wished we could lick our screens while &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-srqwgCg-Ls"&gt;watching internet cooking videos&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFkKC2"&gt;Miyashita thinks he could make a commercial version of the Taste the TV for $875, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. Even if that price had a hefty markup, it’s still quite a bit less than I’d expect — though there’s always room for a printer ink-style business model where the real cost is in the flavor cartridges. But I’m willing to pay any price for the ultimate &lt;em&gt;Great British Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;-watching experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgQReM"&gt;Okay, I know watching a show or movie on the version of the device shown in the video probably wouldn’t be ideal, given that it’s more like a kiosk than a television. And yeah, trying to watch something while being close enough to the screen to lick it would be a literal pain in the neck. But why should we let “practical considerations” get in the way of being able to taste what Remy Ratatouille’s talking about when he describes how well cheese and strawberries go together? (Yes, I’m aware you can just buy these foods, but the TTTV would ensure I was tasting the right type of cheese and strawberry — wouldn’t want to throw off the experience by accidentally trying it with cheddar instead of gouda.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y7ugC7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLXYILcRoPQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q44wnc"&gt;Perhaps Miyashita’s idea of an actual, lickable screen is more suited to information systems than entertainment. But it’s easy to imagine that you could someday disconnect the taste system from the TV and just have a little flavor dispenser that sprays the delicious, delicious chemicals onto a tray at appropriate moments during a show. Or maybe even someday, movie theaters could install mini versions of them to flavor your popcorn in ways that pair well with the scene — who wouldn’t want to eat spice and sand flavored snacks while watching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22739098/dune-part-two-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-paul-atreides-spice-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; part two&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All the news from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QpQT33TsvyGJEP10ARWqjX_sTCI=/31x0:3270x2159/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310441/33433274343_277deba9eb_o__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After decades of work, the launch is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="YYXVwl"&gt;On Christmas Day, NASA is slated to launch one of its most anticipated spacecraft in decades: a next-generation observatory dubbed the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST. It’s taken roughly 25 years for NASA to get this vehicle ready for launch, and sending it to space is an incredibly complex endeavor. But if everything works out just right, JWST promises to see deeper into the Universe than ever before, peering at some of the most ancient stars and galaxies while deepening our understanding of astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6FanL"&gt;Follow along with all of our updates as NASA prepares to send this massive new telescope into space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA authorizes second COVID-19 antiviral pill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QYNrXNuL4NOKfbgbLwMW3vonHE8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310320/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBwghW"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19-certain"&gt;authorized a second at-home antiviral pill&lt;/a&gt; to treat COVID-19 on Thursday. The clearance for the drug, called molnupiravir, came a day after the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22810371/pfizer-merck-paxlovid-covid-antiviral-fda-authorization-omicron"&gt;signed off on Pfizer’s COVID-19 antiviral, called Paxlovid&lt;/a&gt;. Both drugs reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people diagnosed with COVID-19 and at risk of having a severe case of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEXWNp"&gt;Molnupiravir, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, is authorized for people 18 years of age and older who are at a high risk of getting seriously ill if they contract the coronavirus. It’s a higher age cutoff than Paxlovid, which is cleared for people 12 and up, because molnupiravir might affect bone and cartilage growth, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19-certain"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5hVL7"&gt;Like Paxlovid, patients have to start taking Merck’s drug within a few days of developing symptoms in order for it to be the most effective. That might be difficult in the United States, where testing to confirm someone has COVID-19 is often slow and limited — particularly during surges in case numbers when treatments are most needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ia4J55"&gt;Molnupiravir initially appeared to cut the risk of hospitalization and death by about half in a clinical trial. Additional evaluation, though, found that it was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/science/merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-covid-pill.html"&gt;only around 30 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. That’s far less effective than Paxlovid, which reduced hospitalizations and deaths for high-risk groups by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765110/pfizer-antiviral-hospitalization-death-covid"&gt;89 percent&lt;/a&gt; in a clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8sPqH"&gt;Despite its lower efficacy, the US may be reliant on molnupiravir in the near future — the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/biden-team-plans-4-million-doses-of-covid-treatments-in-january?srnd=premium&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Biden administration expects&lt;/a&gt; to have 3 million courses of the Merck drug available by the end of January but only 265,000 courses of Paxlovid. The federal government &lt;a href="https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/investigation-MCM/Paxlovid/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;started allocating&lt;/a&gt; courses of Paxlovid to states after its authorization yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our staff lists their choices for the best of the year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="2jGiFT"&gt;It’s been a difficult year, and with the appearance of the COVID-19 omicron variant, it looks like 2022 may have a rocky start. But whether you’re spending the holidays sheltering at home or hanging with friends or family, you can make things more cheerful and fun by using your brand-new hardware — or your current tech — to watch some great streaming movies or TV, play games, and refresh your computer or mobile device with some cool new apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6zWhm"&gt;We’ve asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to tell us about their favorite streaming videos, games, and apps.

We’ve even got a list of some great TikTok creators. And when it’s time to do some serious stuff, we’ve recommended our favorite apps for Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT4jW9"&gt;We’ll be putting these up over the course of the holiday season. So check out our best of the year picks, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 seemingly falling apart: Lenovo joins T-Mobile, Amazon, AT&amp;T and others in bailing out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzy-55ovp8FaapQCSdd_t8_Ar7M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70304211/CES-2016-stock-verge-10.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjBRnX"&gt;CES, the world’s largest technology show, appears to be in jeopardy due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States. On Wednesday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lenovonews/status/1473824084018360321?s=21"&gt;exhibitor Lenovo announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would “suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well, and despite CES organizers’ statements today that the show would go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgTirG"&gt;So far, T-Mobile has been the most prominent exhibitor to bail. CEO Mike Sievert, one of the Consumer Electronics Show’s featured speakers, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065"&gt;publicly announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he would no longer be doing a keynote and would “significantly limit our in-person participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jiJmu"&gt;Amazon decided not to attend the show in-person entirely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1473486307657539584?s=21"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T also dropped out on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inafried/status/1473755300092002304"&gt;according to Axios’ Ina Fried&lt;/a&gt;. Intel also appears to be reconsidering as of Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL1S9o"&gt;The most recent addition to the list is Hisense. The company typically has a large press conference and significant presence in the LVCC’s central hall, but on Thursday morning Hisense announced it has decided to make its January 4th press conference fully virtual “to ensure the health and safety of our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5tzXmA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CES UPDATE: After closely monitoring the current trends surrounding COVID, it is in the best interest of the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and our communities to suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;— Lenovo Stories &amp;amp; News (@LenovoNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LenovoNews/status/1473824084018360321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gHrSsq"&gt;Meta, Twitter, Pinterest, and iHeartRadio also all announced this week that they won’t attend this version of the annual Las Vegas expo in light of a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the US, as have major tech publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/makejdm/status/1473092737457176577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanaWollman/status/1473336456932470798"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dewalt/status/1473694554322784263"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bheater/status/1473365588672225286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LanceUlanoff/status/1473376084582445069"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mspoonauer/status/1473379627380977665"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But T-Mobile was the first major attendee to bail, with companies like Twitter and even Meta having a far more muted presence at the show in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7H53V"&gt;“T-Mobile will continue to serve as a CES sponsor and title sponsor of the DRL Championship Race but the vast majority of our team will not be traveling to Las Vegas,” reads &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Ft-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F21%2F22849223%2Fces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert will no longer be offering a keynote in-person or virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m sorry we’ll miss seeing everyone at CES this year, but we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our statement here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7"&gt;https://t.co/WAIkFYMzc7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Sievert (@MikeSievert) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSievert/status/1473445847173976065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqsd2L"&gt;Lenovo typically has a medium-sized presence at CES, typically making an array of announcements, though most of its activity generally happens on the Las Vegas Strip and in private meeting rooms, rather than a public booth on the show floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmVmpc"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, by comparison, had a seemingly tiny presence at this year’s show. While the company’s “AT&amp;amp;T Business” division is listed as a featured exhibitor, the company was not expected to have a keynote. AT&amp;amp;T Business also only appears &lt;a href="https://ces22.mapyourshow.com/8_0/floorplan/?st=keyword&amp;amp;sv=at%26t&amp;amp;hallID=A"&gt;to have one very small booth&lt;/a&gt; in the Health and Wellness section of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s North Hall, with no booths for AT&amp;amp;T in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4jdF50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies like Samsung, GM, Intel, LG, Panasonic, Sony, Nikon, Canon are the likely tipping point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgCexR"&gt;Other companies that might make a sizable impact if they ditched CES 2022 include Samsung and GM, which have featured keynotes like T-Mobile, and companies that generally rent a lot of prominent space on the show floor, like LG, Panasonic and Sony. Intel typically rents a lot of prominent space as well, but this year their huge booth appears to be MIA, replaced by Canon, Razer, and other smaller companies. “We are currently revisiting our plans for CES and will provide an update as soon as possible,” an Intel rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwuYQr"&gt;We’ve asked some key companies if they’re still committed; a Sony rep suggested to us that the company still plans to attend as of Tuesday, and LG said Tuesday that “Unless CTA says otherwise,” it’s “still on board.” CES maps show that LG has a very large booth at CES, but the company’s said it’s taking a hybrid approach, making use of QR codes and AR to show off its wares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHHS0K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that AMD and Samsung are still planning a limited presence, Nvidia will have a virtual-only keynote, and that Qualcomm, OnePlus and HTC still plan to attend. Sony, Samsung and Google are all listed as “monitoring local conditions,” which could be read as a meaningless platitude but also gives those companies an easy out if they decide the conditions have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWcwdj"&gt;On Tuesday morning, the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, stated that it still plans to host an in-person show. “At this point, we’re very much focused on having this show and doing it safely and putting the right protocols in place to ensure that people feel comfortable with it,” &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ces-plans-to-push-forward-with-an-in-person-conference-despite-omicron-concerns/"&gt;a CTA exec told &lt;em&gt;Adweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRyNeA"&gt;As of Wednesday, the CTA says it’s received 42 exhibitor cancellations, but has also added 60 new exhibitors in that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnjIMB"&gt;Here is the CTA’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; from Jean Foster, head of marketing and communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X8c2Bw"&gt;CES will be in person on January 5-8 in Las Vegas with strong safety measures in place, and our digital access is also available for people that don’t wish to, or can’t travel to Las Vegas. Our mission remains to convene the industry and give those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLnfPt"&gt;While we recently received 42 exhibitor cancellations (less than 7% of our exhibit floor), since last Thursday, we’ve added 60 new exhibitors for our in person event. Registrations for both our digital access and our Las Vegas event are continuing to show strong momentum, with thousands more registrations in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1X0BM"&gt;CES 2022 will go forward as important innovation for world health and safety, mobility and solving problems will be exhibited. Furthermore&lt;s&gt;,&lt;/s&gt; thousands of smaller and medium sized companies rely on CES for their business. We have increased our official count to over 2200 exhibitors and as &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ces.tech_News_Press-2DReleases_CES-2DPress-2DRelease.aspx-3FNodeID-3D5c6782e3-2D7c62-2D4028-2D8e2a-2D827a1c58cba6&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=dQ0shU35BhNLRgThHTf0QckcsMkcwMRMPdLqg7ETJTibsQxGxH9RNCOVK5RsfJwX&amp;amp;s=J4H1QKA0t9EvNmzUV1I4ySVKFQ2D9X0nI2yoJ60Bq0I&amp;amp;e="&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; many of our top elected officials from both political parties will be at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tctO7m"&gt;Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y3xVw"&gt;In the recent past, we’ve seen the question of “will they or won’t they cancel due to COVID” take a while to resolve. Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the first big tech show to go on after the COVID-19 pandemic initially hit, held out for quite some time even as partners continued to cancel. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;organizers did have to cancel MWC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Major tech companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;ditched the in-person version of MWC 2021&lt;/a&gt; as well. CES 2021, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344977/ces-2021-online-cta-las-vegas-conference-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;was all virtual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDMUvY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:41 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional company replies via Bloomberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZhLB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:09 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Amazon and LG.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P8sia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 4:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information about AT&amp;amp;T, Intel, and a statement from the CTA, which organizes CES each year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVBWcH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22nd, 9:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c33chn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd, 9:57PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Hisense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>11 great shows and movies from 2021 to stream on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyZMZcwo0ZlXh--_OsT6JKBahMM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70310019/RoundUpArt_HBOmax.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Follow the white rabbit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lTsr3c"&gt;It’s the end of year two of the pandemic and many of us staying inside — both to avoid the spread of new variants like Omicron and to avoid the unpredictable weather of 2021. Whether you’re new to HBO Max or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679296/hbo-max-discount-6-months-deal"&gt;signed up earlier for the half-priced deal&lt;/a&gt; but haven’t opened the app in a while, this is a particularly good month to check out the platform. HBO Max is streaming some of the hottest movies that are being simultaneously released in theaters (if you’ve subscribed to the ad-free tier), so you can enjoy them from the comfort and safety of your own home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYrelg"&gt;I hope you have your favorite snacks and drinks ready because here are 11 movies and shows that are worth watching right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gg2mVj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10932723" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kQnzpw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OkCa6N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="VrTnpb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tqzzy45-_g?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="quOnF1"&gt;This highly anticipated fourth installment of The Matrix franchise brings stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss back into the Matrix — but this time, Neo and Trinity don’t seem to know each other. Thanks to the new Morpheus (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Lawrence Fishburne) offering Neo a red pill to bring him back to a new version of the Matrix, Neo ends up joining the resistance to fight a new enemy. Directed by Lana Wachowski, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; was simultaneously released on HBO Max and in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22847124/the-matrix-resurrections-release-date-time-hbo-max-streaming-december-22nd"&gt;starting December 22nd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re planning the watch the streaming version, don’t wait too long — you’ve got (&lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeBestHBOMax2021&amp;amp;aff_unique1=https://www.hbomax.com/the-matrix-resurrections-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;) 31 days to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ZOyIs8"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DwV1Pz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Trilogy: The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Matrix Trilogy" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6y3DOg_Thn2vmc6co6C3xLTnoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084063/617987_the_matrix_gCreditWBPictures.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MqshO4"&gt;Before you start watching &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, you should really fall down the rabbit hole and (re-)watch the complete &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;. The original &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; (1999) follows hacker Thomas Anderson / Neo (Keanu Reeves) as he discovers the truth about the virtual reality world he and fellow humans have been trapped in, a world created by artificial intelligence overlords in the shape of Agent Smith. Written and directed by Lana and Lilly Wachowski, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; changed how slow-motion action sequences are filmed with “bullet time” and is responsible for such iconic cultural references as red pill / blue pill and lines like “There is no spoon.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmpdT9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; (2003) takes place six months after the events of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, where a rogue Agent Smith infiltrates Bane, one of the rebel ship’s crew. Meanwhile, Zion is expecting an attack by the A.I.-powered Sentinels within about 72 hours, and it’s up to Neo as The One to decide the fate of Trinity and the human race. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwf2T1"&gt;In the conclusion to the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Revolutions&lt;/em&gt; (2003), the humans in Zion go to war against the machines. As the rogue Agent Smith attempts to conquer both the Matrix and the real world, it’s up to Neo to thwart his plans. Who will succeed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0nA79G"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u4bF8l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="EUWM2u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kevqiiYNFrc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5cY9A"&gt;Part family drama and part dark comedy, &lt;em&gt;Succession &lt;/em&gt;centers around the fictional media and entertainment mogul Logan Roy as his health declines and he figures out who among his children (or outsiders) has the chops to take over his billion-dollar company. It’s an expletive-filled, modern take on William Shakespeare’s &lt;em&gt;King Lear:&lt;/em&gt; the Roy kids vie for their narcissistic parents’ affection and trust while they (and everyone around them) play games within games. The show just wrapped its third season with a masterful season finale (it has been &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/succession"&gt;renewed for a fourth season&lt;/a&gt;), so you can go binge all three seasons to see what all those Succession-memes are about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MCoS0h"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cTMqdN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;8-Bit Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="rmWEj5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CI-YWRK0VPo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EAteSD"&gt;Need a new Christmas movie to love? &lt;em&gt;8-Bit Christmas&lt;/em&gt; (2021) is a hilarious and wholesome reminder of how much your Christmas present meant to your 10-year-old self. Jake Doyle (played by Neil Patrick Harris) regales his daughter with a story on how he and his friends, who lived in a working-class suburb in 1988 Illinois, tried to get the Nintendo Entertainment System for Christmas. Whether you have your heart set on a red-headed Cabbage Patch doll or the still elusive PlayStation 5, we can all relate to the trials and tribulations of trying to get that present we’ve been dreaming of and not knowing if Santa will get the job done on Christmas Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yWWJXr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uPVsZW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Heights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="qP8qca"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlY-HzJ0kno?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="33bSSw"&gt;As the first blockbuster movie that was released this past summer (after vaccines became more widely available), the movie musical &lt;em&gt;In the Heights&lt;/em&gt; (2021) did not get as big a box office as hoped, but you can watch it on repeat to learn all the songs or choreography. Adapted from the Broadway musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, with a screenplay written by Quiara Alegria Hudes, the movie weaves modern Latino immigrant stories, along with their hopes and dreams, into a great soundtrack full of hip hop and Latin beats. Directed by Jon M. Chu and choreographed by Christopher Scott, the team behind the iconic &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/des3dpKtfIM"&gt;Microsoft Surface “Movement” commercials&lt;/a&gt;, the choreography is crisp and shows off diverse styles, ranging from mambo to ballet, particularly in “96,000” — the Busby Berkeley-esque extravaganza at the swimming pool. I dare you not to sing or couch-dance along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ABhf4S"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DISFVn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="Ja0OPg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HTxJlwRL0V4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLpxgv"&gt;Jean Smart deserves all the awards she gets, like the Emmy she won for portraying diva comedian Deborah Vance in &lt;em&gt;Hacks &lt;/em&gt;this year. Just as her Las Vegas show makes plans to reduce the number of her appearances per week (and therefore her paycheck), Deborah finds herself working with a Gen-Z comedy writer named Ava who can’t do anything right. Through some brilliant writing that is darkly funny and yet feels all too real, the two find they can grudgingly learn from each other and create a more authentic show for Deborah. It’ll be interesting to see where this show goes in season two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vxGkQL"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sL8fVG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nora from Queens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="KKkKB0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jrsjTp07mqA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nPacBL"&gt;When I was feeling extremely homesick during the first lockdown, my howling laughter from watching season one of &lt;em&gt;Nora from Queens&lt;/em&gt; really brought me a little closer to my family. Co-written and developed by Awkwafina (&lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; Nora Lum), the show is loosely based on the actress’s own family: she was brought up by her Chinese American grandmother because her Korean mother passed away when she was young. The show breaks the model minority myth that all Asian Americans are over-achievers and highlights some of the intra-racial tensions within the Asian American community. When an app created by Nora and her cousin Edmund (played by SNL’s Bowen Yang) gets bought up by a Chinese tech company, the show really demonstrates what it’s capable of. Both seasons one and two are available on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rbIb9O"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OnDg7T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raised by Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="lW76RE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAg6RTQEfeM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qi5zdl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raised by Wolves&lt;/em&gt; (2020) is a horror sci-fi show that makes you question who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Directed and executive produced by Ridley Scott for its first two episodes, the show starts off by introducing you to two androids called Father and Mother, who crash land on the desolate Kepler-22b planet and birth some human babies. They seem like a loving family until an accident forces them to cross paths with a group of human missionaries who are very suspicious of the androids. That’s when the audience realizes the two groups have been at war with each other for some time and are hungry for revenge. Created by Aaron Guzikowski, there is a strong sense of foreboding in this world, but you just can’t turn away — good thing this show has already been renewed for season two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="shtZ3O"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWsbLm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="JHl2QC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/igVXQT4HrEo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AmyIGV"&gt;I had no idea HBO Max offers the entire Studio Ghibli library on HBO Max (I always assumed it would be on Disney Plus). Known for its environmentally conscious messages, beautifully hand-drawn animations, and strong female characters, the Hayao Miyazaki-led Japanese studio has something for everyone. &lt;em&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/em&gt; (1988) is my personal favorite: you experience the world through the eyes of the sisters Satsuki and Mei as they befriend the forest spirits in their new home. Miyazaki manages to capture the feelings of growing up so perfectly that I feel like I just fell into the rabbit hole of my own childhood every time I re-watch this classic.&lt;/p&gt;
