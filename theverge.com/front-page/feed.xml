    <title>Instagram offers creators up to $35,000 to post videos to its TikTok clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xrm0Y6aAiB-CF8OaQLOeJuEy_K4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70131608/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5YaeKx"&gt;Instagram is offering massive sums of money to creators to post videos on its TikTok competitor Reels, as highlighted in a pair of reports from &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAuYXNhbmEuY29tLw&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGwCkZOtldkfhaQtFvM0D9KiRGhkkWt1tpAXXPXhy6O9udCHIGiX6nVrq3YzsGebDvve05FBYhXTQq09s8AFM1z2skyCbvz9MvG791dBKa4fz1mi3EPAWt6PqF-3hD7-f9hSX_aPMwlqkKgu2_oCi1CpAu1pO45WKuwdKEv5iRr-"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-instagram-facebook-is-paying-influencers-reels-bonuses-2021-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram announced its &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/183392733628561"&gt;bonus program for Reels&lt;/a&gt; in July when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would be paying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;$1 billion to creators through 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnOGVt"&gt;These reports shed new light on exactly how much individual creators are being offered for their Reels, and how many views they need to get in order to receive the maximum bonus payout. On the high end, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; points to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/qigb8i/reels_bonus_feature_error/"&gt;one Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; where someone has been offered as much as $35,000 if their Reels get 58.31 million views in a month. That’s in line with what &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports was offered to Sam and Cori Werrell make Reels content for their 283,000 Instagram followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzdPzc1ilSsxClg1cw4rMWdyKxI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23008243/Image_from_iOS__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users are shown a screen outlining the bonus scheme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9nD2Ym"&gt;Meanwhile, smaller creators have reportedly been offered much more modest sums. Maddy Corbin, a creator with around 52,000 Instagram followers, was reportedly offered up to $1,000, but says that she knows of others being offered $600 or $800. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports that these bonuses appear to be increasing over time — another creator with 24,000 Instagram followers was recently offered $8,500 for 9.28 million views. The same payout was offered to a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff member with 15,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuyZk7"&gt;There don’t seem to be any firm rules about how payment amounts correspond to follower counts. Instagram tells &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that the program is in its early stages, and that it’s still experimenting with the format. “We’re continuing to test payments as we roll out to more creators, and expect them to fluctuate while we’re still getting started,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HcQFk"&gt;YouTube and Snapchat are offering their own incentives to creators. In August, YouTube announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606291/youtube-shorts-fund-launches-100-million"&gt;pay up to $10,000 a month&lt;/a&gt; for popular videos. Meanwhile, last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711632/snapchat-spotlight-challenges-announced-cash-prizes-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat announced Spotlight Challenges&lt;/a&gt;, which offers various rewards to incentivise making videos. Snapchat says its prize pools typically range from $1,000 to $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGHBoq"&gt;There are two possible interpretations of these platforms’ bonus schemes. The generous version is that Meta-owned Instagram wants to share the wealth with the creators at the foundation of its platform. But it’s no secret that Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat are warily eying up TikTok’s explosion in popularity, and it doesn’t seem like a coincidence that many of the bonus schemes are focussed around short-form video services that each bear an uncanny resemblance to TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeUjwv"&gt;For its part, TikTok appears to be unfazed by the amount of money being thrown around by its competitors. In late September it announced it had passed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users"&gt;1 billion monthly active users mark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;order one of the new Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year — and we’re bound to see far more as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday approach&lt;/a&gt;. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44jktU"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Yen8lP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwEyX"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to $169. If you prefer the bigger, 42mm configuration with GPS, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $199 instead of $229. Like the 38mm model, it’s also available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYU8dEI5wH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101062" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, though, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N8sVLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version with a silver aluminum case and an abyss blue sport band for $270 instead of $279 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F305879066&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Other configurations — as well as the larger, 44mm model with GPS — are currently only available at full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k7Seuv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716438/apple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s wearable lineup&lt;/a&gt;, you can still buy the Apple Watch Series 6 at several retailers. The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. Right now, for instance, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red variant &lt;/a&gt;at Amazon right now for $349, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm model with GPS is your fancy, it’s available in white, navy, and red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price. The red configuration is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the same price, as is the black model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-44mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band%2F-%2FA-80606297" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hZHCRf"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iK520N"&gt;With a slightly altered design and larger display, the new Series 7 comes in either a 41mm configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm configuration starting at $429. There are very few deals to speak of right now, however, you can pick up the 41mm, GPS-equipped model with a green Sport Band and green aluminum casing for $390 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 discount. The 45mm model with GPS is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in red for $420.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE4BzP"&gt;Although both deals are slight, it is possible that we’ll see bigger discounts as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday, especially given Amazon has taken between $30 and $40 off a number of different sizes and configurations of the Series 7 in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4m59DD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rwvKCC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s Vive Focus 3 update could free arcades from VR backpacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RmP578rEo3maa9n8Wo_281LSoY8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130416/arobertson_210630_4670_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Adi Robertson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D5v4m7"&gt;HTC is adding &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2021/11/11/introducing-new-features-vive-focus-3/"&gt;a few big updates&lt;/a&gt; to its Vive Focus 3 virtual reality headset, aiming to make it better for big, free-roaming multiplayer VR games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZdUSw"&gt;The Vive Focus 3 — a $1,300 non-consumer-focused wireless headset — is adding a new feature called Location Based Entertainment, or LBE Mode. LBE Mode greatly expands the headset’s tracking distance to 33 by 30 meters. Meanwhile, an additional feature called Map Sharing lets multiple headsets share the same virtual world in the same location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2D7Kn"&gt;Together, these features mean the Focus 3 can more easily support the group VR sessions you’d find at an immersive free-roam arcade space like Zero Latency or The Void. HTC has also added a few other options. There’s a mode that immediately calibrates the headset when a new user puts it on instead of requiring a brief setup process, which is designed to help arcades put people into experiences more quickly. An additional calibration mode will let headsets track objects besides the Focus 3 controller, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172022/htc-vive-tracker-vr-motion-tracker-adapter"&gt;the Vive Tracker&lt;/a&gt; puck. And the headset will soon support the WiFi 6E standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WE6zo6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Focus 3 was released earlier this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJefgL"&gt;Location-based VR entertainment — the kind where users move around a real, physical arena with other people rather than standing in a stationary space — often relies on plugging headsets like the original HTC Vive into wearable backpack computers. That has several disadvantages: it takes time to put people in the backpacks, the backpack strap systems may fit some users poorly, and they make the experience less comfortable for everyone. A lot of the headsets also require external tracking beacons like HTC and Valve’s Lighthouse system, which must be set up overhead and can be accidentally blocked by other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjSomr"&gt;Fully self-contained systems that incorporate tracking cameras and computing power into the headset can change that. But they’ve only been widely available for a couple of years, and the biggest one, the Oculus Quest from Facebook / Meta, is primarily aimed at home use. The Vive Focus 3 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588917/htc-vive-focus-3-vr-headset-review"&gt;has a similar feature set to the Quest&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s tailored for businesses, and this update bolsters HTC’s longtime presence in the VR location-based entertainment and arcade market. It could also make VR arcades, which have &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/location-based-vr-covid-19"&gt;suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, more fun and convenient places to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ref_US_EBF21_P1_GW_Desk_DealsSingle_DOTD_ENES=&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=3488afaa-3745-41ec-bed9-8c643eff58e9&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=JWNIH&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=2DJTCZEMSEHW2K3CCY8Y&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=gdIC3&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=652b3660-a90a-45ff-b04c-3e93a23460c4&amp;amp;ref_=pd_gw_unk"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1, and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in white for $249. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,798&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $1,398&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eAZDRm"&gt;Amazon is hosting a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A2NEKY0JEA1965"&gt;buy two, get one free promotion&lt;/a&gt; on a notable selection of books, movies, video games, and other products. Highlights include everything from Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;and the latest Call of Duty title to the classic board game &lt;em&gt;Catan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u3IApI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $190 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $215 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="FfgzdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ejfdaH"&gt;Best Buy Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning the retailer will refund the price difference of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nl3yNN"&gt;Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts on LG’s C1 OLED&lt;/a&gt; as Amazon, while adding other perks in addition to the six-month subscription to HBO Max. These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzBPD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of other products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is currently selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $280. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T59Y6S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="CO0Wc6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_7721606980660150198sIzbeu"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy at an all-time low. Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $220. Like the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzQ0Njg2L2FwcGxlLWFpcnBvZHMtdGhpcmQtZ2VuLXJldmlldw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Be70b5668" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 AirPods Pro come with a new charging case that &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTgvMjI3MzMxODMvYXBwbGUtbWFnc2FmZS1jaGFyZ2luZy1jYXNlLWFpcnBvZHMtcHJvLXFp/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bd83707a1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;works with Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging system&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $130 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUs7A8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $100 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $1,100 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL6nXD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ysr84c"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip, and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3zmNuJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is selling the popular action cam for $450 instead. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AuzgvG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848365"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which allows you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jv2SvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptops 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNqjUh"&gt;First off, the Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,200&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G5or8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10842148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great, and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TALLIn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845789"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xgjs1u"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th and has been running similar deals every week since. The retail store also officially launched its weekly &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Holiday Best” deals&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, which run every Sunday online and in-store. Target will also be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kGsRxP"&gt;Probably the best deal Target has going for it right now is its &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CcA5Vj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is currently selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7moVRr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $200. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/YgB3Am" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now, $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold. Target’s current discount was supposed to expire on November 6th, however, it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6bMV4g"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/XxG2EG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Target for $50&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model keeps the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ey6aVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/a12Qob" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S. Mode&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at Target for $430 instead of $540. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. Like the Beats Solo 3 deal, the discount was supposed to expire on November 7th, meaning its duration is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue supercenter recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire soon. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;While many of these deals aren’t live yet, we’ve collected a handful that piqued our interest below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $79&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart will be offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q7R0XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwKlAu"&gt;One of our favorite budget tablets from last year just got a little cheaper. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Tab-A7-32GB-10-4-Wi-Fi-Gray-SM-T500NZABXAR%2F882296471" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Walmart for $139&lt;/a&gt; through November 14th. This brings it well below the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, which features 32GB of internal storage and a 10.4-inch display. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were with the vibrant display and sturdy build quality of this unassuming tablet. It’s not going to rival, say, the latest iPad Air or Mini, but it remains a solid entertainment device, especially if you plan to consume Amazon content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k2O7Rx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DC2Mly"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zAwjwU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors delays Endurance EV pickup after announcing Foxconn deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dw7xasOy3DvbaYZsP7Iquqb7XKE=/110x0:3050x1960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130173/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_4.39.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEHaB"&gt;Cash-strapped EV startup Lordstown Motors is delaying the launch of its electric pickup truck, the Endurance, one day after announcing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775168/foxconn-lordstown-motors-electric-vehicle-factory-trump-ohio"&gt;sale of its Ohio factory to iPhone assembler Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJigzW"&gt;Lordstown Motors said Thursday that it now plans to ship the Endurance in the third quarter of 2022, not the second as previously targeted, because of supply chain shortages. It &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;announced a third-quarter loss&lt;/a&gt; of $96 million and said it will finish the year with just $150 million to $180 million in cash — including a $100 million payment from Foxconn toward the purchase of the factory. Lordstown Motors is also still building pre-production versions of the truck at the Ohio factory despite saying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;as recently as August&lt;/a&gt; that it would be making production-level trucks in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QqpZU"&gt;In addition, the startup distanced itself a bit from the in-wheel motor technology that it has been promoting since its inception, as it now plans to try to design additional vehicles based on Foxconn’s own EV platform. While the Endurance will still use the hub motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644661/lordstown-motors-ceo-daniel-ninivaggi-hertz-steve-burns"&gt;new CEO Daniel Ninivaggi&lt;/a&gt; said Thursday that “not every vehicle needs hub motors, and we’ll weigh the tradeoffs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJrOX3"&gt;Ninivaggi also praised the hub motor’s “unique... combination of horsepower, torque, handling, and turning radius.” (After this story was published, Lordstown Motors’ marketing and communications lead Kimberly Spell said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the startup wants to “reiterate our commitment to the technology that will fuel the Endurance,” referring to the hub motors.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eg0SPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“not every vehicle needs hub motors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aON7f6"&gt;In the span of just two years, Lordstown Motors has gone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;a new startup that won the support of the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;, to a public company that raised hundreds of millions of dollars on claims it would release the first EV pickup truck, to facing allegations of fraud and two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;government investigations&lt;/a&gt;. It has recently turned over its entire leadership team (much like Workhorse, the EV startup that Lordstown Motors was essentially birthed from) and has sold its factory to Foxconn to stay alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jhjOF"&gt;Once the sale closes in April 2022, Lordstown Motors will only occupy 30,000 of the 6.2 million square feet available at the factory it once owned, while other electric vehicle startups like Fisker Inc. come in to work with Foxconn on their own EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3BGFf"&gt;Ninivaggi, who recently finished a seven-year run on the board of Hertz, emphasized on a conference call Thursday that Foxconn is “only part of the solution.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1WtPN"&gt;“We realize that our company is not just an appendage to Foxconn,” he said. “We must execute, and execute better, and deliver the Endurance truck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jprgch"&gt;He also thanked “all the shareholders who have hung in there with us” and acknowledged the startup that beat Lordstown Motors (and everybody else) to market with an electric pickup truck: Rivian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zC4FYa"&gt;“It’s not easy; we see the news every day, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;$100 billion market cap for Rivian&lt;/a&gt;. And we know we have a long way to go, but we feel like we have a path and a strong partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLee9H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added response from Lordstown Motors about its continued support of its hub motor technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The global chip shortage is a nightmare before Christmas</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fHMlPj"&gt;The global chip shortage has had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;massive effect&lt;/a&gt; on the entire technology industry for more than a year, but a wave of gaming hardware news over the past week and change has shown that things aren’t going to get better anytime soon. Gaming companies big and small are going to be feeling the sting well into next year, and it’s not just Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen consoles that could be hard to get a hold of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zl9b8"&gt;Nintendo was arguably the first to kick off the waterfall of news, revising its &lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/strong&gt; sales forecast for the fiscal year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;down by 1.5 million&lt;/a&gt; on November 4th “due to the effects of the global semiconductor shortage,” &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211104_4e.pdf"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa elaborated further &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211105_2e.pdf"&gt;in a Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, saying that “there has not been a major improvement in the situation” since the beginning of the fiscal year (which starts in April). The company is “evaluating alternative components and reviewing our designs,” according to Ko Shiota, GM of Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, but it’s unclear right now if anything it is looking at might make it easier to find a Switch on the shelf. (And if you don’t already have one of the Switch-compatible N64 controllers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760049/nintendo-switch-64-n64-controller-in-stock-2022-next-year"&gt;you’re out of luck until next year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro2sbv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck handheld gaming PC&lt;/strong&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;delayed two months&lt;/a&gt; from a December to a February launch on November 11th. “We did our best to work around the global supply chain issues, but due to material shortages, components aren’t reaching our manufacturing facilities in time for us to meet our initial launch dates,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712"&gt;Valve said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Even before the delay, we had a sense that Steam Deck supply was going to be tight, as estimated order availability slipped to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580453/valve-steam-deck-pre-order-handheld-pc-gaming"&gt;early 2022 very soon&lt;/a&gt; after the initial reservations went live. But now, even people who had secured a December 2021 order date are going to have to wait a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BSAEVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony expects to make fewer PS5s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v50J58"&gt;Sony reportedly expects to make fewer &lt;strong&gt;PS5s&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/sony-trims-playstation-5-assembly-plans-after-chip-shortages-hit"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company originally forecasted it could assemble 16 million consoles in the current fiscal year (which ends in March), but now, it plans to make “about 15 million,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. The PS5 has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;incredibly hard to find&lt;/a&gt; since it launched in November 2020, and that’s likely not going to become easier soon: Sony’s manufacturing partners told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that meeting Sony’s goal of 22.6 million PS5 sales in the next fiscal year will be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyWJLM"&gt;Panic’s &lt;strong&gt;Playdate&lt;/strong&gt; handheld has been pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776649/panic-playdate-delay-2022-handheld-battery-chip-shortage"&gt;from late 2021 to early 2022&lt;/a&gt;. While the delay for initial units was due to faulty batteries, components for future Playdates are challenging to come by, &lt;a href="https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;. The Playdate’s current CPU, for example, isn’t available for two years, which has forced the company to redesign the main board with a more readily available CPU for Playdates made later in 2022. Panic warns that “there are a number of other part shortages we’re trying to outsmart right now,” so if it can’t get past those, that might mean it will be hard to get a Playdate down the road. If you have any interest in a Playdate, you might want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587193/playdate-preorder-how-to-panic-teenage-engineering-handheld-console"&gt;preorder one now&lt;/a&gt; to secure your place in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rybeLU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;And these are only shifts that we know about&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aJoMiI"&gt;These are only some recent shifts&lt;em&gt; that we know about&lt;/em&gt; — there could be other issues and delays behind the scenes that we’re not aware of. Microsoft’s Xbox boss Phil Spencer warned of ongoing shortages in September, saying that Xbox supply issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;will last into 2022&lt;/a&gt;. And the issue goes far beyond gaming hardware makers, with Intel saying that the chip shortage could last until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;at least 2023&lt;/a&gt; and Apple, which is renowned for its mastery of its supply chain, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;taking a $6 billion hit last quarter&lt;/a&gt; because of constraints. Despite that, you can still get many Apple products by Christmas if you order them now from the company’s website, but that’s not as much of a sure thing for most gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXMCl2"&gt;Amidst the many delays, there is one potential bright spot. The Analogue Pocket retro handheld, which has already been delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22361017/analogue-pocket-handheld-delayed-electronic-component-shortage"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667465/analogue-pocket-preorders-delay-december-2021"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; because of supply chain challenges, is “still on track” for a December launch, Analogue founder and CEO Christopher Taber told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email on Wednesday. But if even Nintendo and Sony are having trouble, you might not want to get too excited until you have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22722412/analogue-pocket-analogueos-operating-system-game-boy-retro"&gt;the Pocket&lt;/a&gt; in your hands. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qRq7SHCJLRJiiCNR0ulhJp0cwg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130116/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZnL4b"&gt;Apple’s fall software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lXVnu"&gt;There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its mind about how its operating systems and the rules that govern it work — &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;like when it allowed for third-party email and browser apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;in iOS 14 &lt;/a&gt;— there’s just less room for big additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s8ks4Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple macOS 12 Monterey review: the best is yet to come","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"},{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pjaj8I"&gt;Second is the fact that — because Apple silos off virtually all its updates, big or small, to help pad out the “big” iOS release — smaller but useful quality of life improvements often get stuck waiting around months for the fall cycle to line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXjwLc"&gt;Take iOS 15, which added a grid view and the ability to blur a background in FaceTime, core features that have already been a key part of Zoom and Google Meet’s toolkits for making larger virtual conversations more organized. Neither appears to be the kind of earth-shattering, OS-level feature that would require waiting for a new version of iOS, but Apple saved the updates to be part of iOS 15 anyway, despite the fact that they undoubtedly would have been more useful during the height of the pandemic when video chatting was more heavily in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV2Lpr"&gt;Apple has, in fairness, already started to trend away from its one-and-done updates, if only because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;it’s missed its self-imposed deadlines&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. Major features for iOS and macOS like SharePlay or Universal Control have been delayed from the initial dot-zero builds for more development time. Point releases have gotten more and more important, too, used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936510/apple-ios-13-2-airpods-pro-compatible"&gt;debut new emoji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265019/apple-ios-13-5-out-now-unlock-iphone-face-mask-id-exposure-notification-covid-19"&gt;critical Face ID updates for better mask support&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s high-profile App Tracking Transparency requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey sits on a table in front of a window.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNSTz5"&gt;To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzPZiA"&gt;Spaced out software updates wouldn’t even be a new idea for Apple, at least on the macOS side of things. Apple spent almost a decade spacing out OS X releases every two years before it brought back annual releases with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mZbllQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spaced out updates aren’t a new idea for Apple, either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxo47T"&gt;Sure, Apple does get some benefit from its current cadence. On a basic level, bundling iOS and macOS updates gives Apple a single, cohesive marketing push, a package of features that it can point to and say, “Look, here are all the ways the new software makes your life better.” The annual releases also mean that Apple can count on journalists writing roundups of the new features every year at WWDC and reviews of those new features in the fall, and Apple might have to risk that consistent coverage if it changes things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j59DEI"&gt;But while the boosted public awareness is nice, I doubt that Apple would be missing out on much if it spaced out annual releases. New iPhones are not sold on the strength of having Apple’s new software installed; customers praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; because of their battery life and processing speed, not because they shipped with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck9iBC"&gt;People install iOS and macOS updates, but outside of the tech sphere, it’s not something that people are &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to do. More often than not, Apple updates are installed out of a grudging frustration at push notifications and a desire to banish alert bubbles, not because Focus modes allow power users to set up more granular do-not-disturb settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wl2uuH"&gt;Spacing out iOS and macOS updates for when Apple actually has big marquee features to show off (like it did during the OS X days when it actually &lt;em&gt;charged&lt;/em&gt; for new updates) could go a long way to fixing that unenthusiastic update cycle. Less frequent iOS updates could help make sure that there’s actually something to get excited for, like a new visual design or substantial new features (like Siri). Additionally, Apple would get more time to develop new versions of its software, which could theoretically cut down on the bugs and glitches in the final versions of whatever it does ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crtfgq"&gt;Smaller updates, meanwhile, can be doled out over the year when they’re ready, instead of waiting to cluster every minor update into a massive, overwhelming grab bag once a year where they’re more likely to be overshadowed anyway by the more substantial parts of the new operating system. More gradual updates that aren’t tied to a single major release is an idea we know works, too, because it’s how every other third-party app on iOS already handles updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0w6US"&gt;But right now, Apple’s system of annual releases leaves it with the worst of both worlds: siloed updates that come too infrequently for minor features while still not having enough major features to be worth the hype. If Apple can’t make macOS and iOS updates more substantial, it might be time to leave the annual release cycle behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is emailing out 50,000 Microsoft Store gift cards for the holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hitlMjKF3f1St_n9VcsR0Ar1OMw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130094/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkudT"&gt;Double-check your inbox and your spam folder because Microsoft might have left something in there for you. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775341/microsoft-store-gift-card-email-promotion"&gt;a few people noticed gift cards for the Microsoft Store suddenly appearing via email&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has confirmed it sent out 50,000 of the codes to US customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2qx6t"&gt;Per a Microsoft spokesperson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dEPNd9"&gt;To help spread holiday cheer, Microsoft Store has surprised a total of 50,000 U.S. customers with virtual gift cards via email. 25,000 customers will receive a $100 Microsoft Gift Card while 25,000 others will receive a $10 Microsoft Gift Card ahead of this holiday season. These randomly selected recipients can redeem their gift card on Microsoft Store through December 31, 2021 and spend it within 90 days of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gTHm3d"&gt;If you weren’t randomly selected, then you’re in good company — we didn’t get anything from the giveaway either. But it’s worth checking whatever email account you might use for Xbox Live or Skype. Even if you don’t need anything from the Microsoft Store, someone on your list will probably appreciate a new mouse or headset.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ten top weather apps for Android phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Radical Drop In Temperatures And Winter Weather In Pamplona" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qQQ1D9d2wXKYrGmSr1vJt7obUc=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66996956/1215923322.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="revCAV"&gt;One of the more popular uses for phones (besides taking photos and watching TikTok videos) is to check out the weather. As a result, there are myriad weather apps out there, making it really hard to pick which one to use. So we’ve put together this guide to what we think are some of the better ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcUkev"&gt;With the exception of one that used to be very well-liked: Dark Sky. Back in March 2020, Dark Sky was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;acquired by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and almost immediately removed from the Google Play app store. Originally, the Dark Sky API was going to be pulled as well — leaving a lot of third-party apps desperately looking for a substitute — but that’s been put off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527878/dark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022"&gt;until at least the end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. (By the way, if you use the iOS version of Dark Sky, that’s going away at the end of 2022 as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or04Hp"&gt;Of course, if you want, you can just settle for the “At a Glance” weather widget that Google includes on its homescreen; tap that, and you get a reasonably good weather report. But if you’re a weather geek, or you want to be able to tweak your weather report a little more than Google allows, we’ve got 10 alternatives here. All have free versions with ads, and all but one have paid versions that remove the ads and often include additional features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSJiCj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: in earlier versions of this article, we listed the permissions that each app requested. However, since most weather apps seem to ask for pretty much the same permissions, we’ve removed the listings and suggest that you simply check out your chosen weather app’s list of permissions that’s at the bottom of its page in the Play Store. (That’s not a bad idea for any app, actually.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bNVpUL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grailr.carrotweather"&gt;Carrot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Carrot greets the day with a snarky comment." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mhLXvDyvP46KmaY4b_kbBLSeQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19864259/Carrot1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot greets the day with a snarky comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Carrot offers a reasonable amount of data on current and upcoming weather." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0fzOlaiIUMx19v6beZ6EJxVyjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19864262/Carrot2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot offers data on current and upcoming weather.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zTOy3"&gt;Carrot may be known less for its weather predictions than for its personality, which offers tongue-in-cheek commentary in audio and / or text on the happenings of the day. (One day, for example, it snarked, “I’m sending bad weather to all the people who refuse to wear masks to hide hideous faces.”) In fact, you can set its personality (friendly, snarky, homicidal, or overkill) and its politics (liberal, conservative, centrist, libertarian, communist, or apolitical) to suit your own tastes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XElp3P"&gt;All that being said, Carrot is a solid, good-looking app that offers a reasonable amount of data on current and upcoming weather. The Android app uses the Dark Sky API for its data; the iOS app, on the other hand, uses a variety of sources, such as Dark Sky, AccuWeather, AerisWeather, and Foreca. It also has several features that the Android app lacks, but in an email, creator Brian Mueller promised a major update in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFb5Si"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads. “Premium Club” removes the ads and offers a widget and other features for $0.99 per month or $3.99 annually.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbQTup"&gt;1Weather is a well-known app with a variety of screens showing the current weather, the forecast, precipitation, radar, and the Sun and Moon rise and set, among others. I personally found the interface a bit crowded, but it does offer a lot of information, and it includes short weather-related articles. Unfortunately, not only do scrolling ads sit right in the center of the main screen, on other pages the ads take up a good third of the screen, and there are also full-page pop-up ads. According to the app’s website, it gets its info using the Weather 2020 platform, along with meteorologist Gary Lezak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8Hl2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads. Without ads: $1.99 one-time purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iIf2N7"&gt;Anyone who ever watched cable TV or listened to the radio is probably familiar with AccuWeather, which has been used by many stations for their forecasts. &lt;a href="https://corporate.accuweather.com/company/weather-matters/"&gt;According to its website&lt;/a&gt;, it collects its own data using a combination of meteorologists, a global forecast engine, and other sources. The app has an attractive interface that offers immediate access to the current actual and “RealFeel” temperatures. The Next 4-Hours MinuteCast tells you what kind of precipitation to expect (if any) over the next four hours. You can see forecasts on an hourly and daily basis, along with current radar, using tabs at the bottom of the screen; you can also track any approaching hurricanes. Tap the Eyewitness News icon at the top-right corner for the latest news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf1bdW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads or $8.99 annually for no ads, weather alerts, and live forecast radar.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today Weather is a very attractive app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VGgadK"&gt;Today Weather may be the best looking of all the apps listed here. It’s got a straightforward interface that starts with a photo and today’s weather, and you can scroll down for details on the weather for the next 24 hours and seven days, live radar, air quality, and other categories. If you’re in the US, you can choose to get your data from a variety of sources, including Today Weather itself, the National Weather Service, Weatherbit.io, Open Weather Map, or YR.no / Met.no (the Norwegian Meteorological Institute). Paying customers can choose from even more data sources, including AccuWeather and Dark Sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyBEWT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads, $1.99 for six months, $2.99 for one year, or $6.99 forever. The paid options remove ads, let you choose your data source, and add a few other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h0QahI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appyweather.appyweather"&gt;Appy Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Appy Weather has a simple, straightforward interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clsyFQuyZgM7M7jvrHU-UkK4sW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006300/Screenshot_20211111_142716.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appy Weather has a simple, straightforward interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Besides the day’s timeline, you can get hourly and weekly reports." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pF_Yhij8NvG-Gdb5s1qRg2BNlYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006299/Screenshot_20211111_142904.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Besides the day’s timeline, you can get hourly and weekly reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7z9oCw"&gt;Appy Weather bills itself as “the most personal weather app.” It’s certainly privacy-conscious; at the outset, it asks if you want to check the weather via your current location (in which case it requires permission), or do a search for your location (in which case it doesn’t ask for your location permission). The interface is straightforward and simple, especially its timeline, which lets you scroll down to see the current weather and the upcoming forecast. You can also scroll from left to right at the bottom to see hourly and daily forecasts. Appy Weather currently uses a variety of sources for its data, including Dark Sky, Foreca, and OpenWeather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sx0aGB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free version with ads. The Plus version costs $4.99 annually for no ads, radar, notifications, widgets, and other features. The Pro version adds custom notifications and premium weather providers for $9.99 per year. A second Pro version unlocks a variety of map layers; it costs $4.99 a month or $19.99 annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zx4YCP"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=widget.dd.com.overdrop.free"&gt;Overdrop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Overdrop has a simple, easy-to-understand interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N3mm-XY8txXpFG4pNH5hugCyrQU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006420/Screenshot_20211111_144105.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overdrop has a simple, easy-to-understand interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down for more weather data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chlFpSyhyYqtrF4FYoGKLkx5uL4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006421/Screenshot_20211111_144149.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down for more weather data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOjQ5k"&gt;Like Appy Weather, Overdrop has a simple, easy-to-understand interface with a reasonable, if somewhat limited, selection. You can see the current weather, hourly weather, the air quality, a radar map, and weekly forecast; select a drop-down arrow to get more details. However, its main advantage may be that, if you’re a paying customer, you can access 54 different weather widgets — something that widget fans may find worth the price. At the time of the review, you could choose between Open Weather Map, Dark Sky, or Weatherbit if you used the free version; paid subscribers can also select AccuWeather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTEOp7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads; Pro version costs $1.59 per month, $7.99 annually, or $14.99 for a lifetime sub. The paid options remove ads, unlock additional providers, and add 54 widgets and 10 themes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great app if you want to get your data from the NOAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The simple app offers a small but easily understood amount of data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhyIQmHP9YZP-VL3OxxGvDuvd18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006567/Screenshot_20211111_151139.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The simple app offers a small but easily understood amount of data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L9fSXU"&gt;This simple app goes to the source: the National Weather Service, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It presents data from the NOAA in a clear, easy-to-read format: it opens to the weekly forecast, and you can tap on each day to get more data. You can also get an hourly forecast and a weather map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbMLV2"&gt;By the way, if you want to get your weather info directly from the NOAA, you can go to the site (&lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/"&gt;weather.gov&lt;/a&gt;), enter your zip code to get your local forecast, and then save the mobile page to your homescreen (by tapping the three “More” dots in the upper-right corner of your browser and then selecting “Add to Home screen”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMreXe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free with ads. $1.99 version removes ads and allows more than three saved locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jOXoUa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enzuredigital.weatherbomb"&gt;FlowX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FlowX lets you adjust the data that it shows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3lf2tL"&gt;It’s immediately apparent that FlowX (once known as WeatherBomb) is for weather nerds: when you first install it, it opens to a weather map and temperature / humidity charts rather than the usual text-based weather summary, and it lets you choose what types of data the map shows. You get a seven-day forecast; slide your finger across the screen for each day’s forecast. The free app gets its data from the NOAA; the Bronze version gives you more map styles, a graph editor, and up to a 16-day forecast for $4.99 / year. The Silver subscription ($9.99 / year) adds RainViewer Radar and three regional weather models, among other features, and the Gold ($19.99 / year) adds even more, including models for Europe, global ocean temperature and current, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFaFKu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free; $4.99 / year for the Bronze version, $9.99 / year for the Silver version, and  $19.99 / year version for the Gold version.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nn1xTx"&gt;Yahoo Weather is a good-looking and solid weather app that lets you scroll sideways for different locations. You scroll down for the week’s weather, a weather map, wind and pressure, precipitation, and schedules for the Sun and Moon. The homepage features the latest coronavirus statistics (you can hide them if you wish), and there is no premium version, so you’re stuck with the ads. Still, this is a worthy app. (Note: I couldn’t find any first-hand information about the data source, but its weather maps are sourced from The Weather Channel.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PDMMY3"&gt;If you like sassy weather apps like Carrot, you might also want to try What The ForeCast?! It opens with an opinionated statement on the homepage; you can adjust the profanity level to either On, Some, Minimal, or Off and choose to make it vocal or silent. In fact, the UI settings are in general more varied than most other apps, letting you adjust it to fit your preferences. Scroll down for the daily and weekly forecasts; ads are at the bottom of the screen. You can also find data about the air quality index, bee index, and others via icons at the top of the homescreen. The app uses AerisWeather as a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBK6fi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free; $1.99 will remove the ads and another $1.99 will add a widget. The app also has its own Etsy page with various merch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is acquiring an audiobook company </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EVy8u"&gt;Spotify has announced plans to acquire the audiobook services and distribution company Findaway for an undisclosed price. The company operates multiple businesses, including distributing audiobooks to various platforms and offering audiobook creation services under its business Findaway Voices. The company pairs authors with narrators, which could become a new and valuable source of revenue for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M31AsA"&gt;It also makes Spotify both a commercial bookseller and a publisher of audiobooks, a title the company has been hesitant to accept for its podcasting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1js05"&gt;“With this acquisition, we’re going to be able to accelerate the addition of an audiobook catalog onto the platform so that users can effectively get all of the audio content that they want all on one platform,” says Nir Zicherman, head of audiobooks at Spotify, in a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5ebJt"&gt;Zicherman says the team is focusing on “innovation” in the space to make audiobooks a “richer experience,” as well as “democratization,” in that more people can create and publish more audiobooks. It also wants to work on audiobook discovery, as it has always focused on with music and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YWw8Ga"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XLnUqb"&gt;Zicherman declined to share any specifics on exclusives that might factor into Spotify’s audiobook strategy but did praise the company’s work with creators. “Voices currently allows creators to distribute broadly,” he says, “and that is a very important part of the offering and something that we plan to keep and to continue supporting because we think that it’s part of what makes the platform so powerful from a creator standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgbYzf"&gt;Zicherman also says the core Spotify app will likely gain more audiobooks in early 2022 when certain Open Access partnerships begin distributing content there. (Storytel, a major audiobook streaming app, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-20/storytel-audiobooks-will-be-available-on-spotify-later-this-year/"&gt;is an initial partner&lt;/a&gt;.) These moves aren’t the first to signal Spotify’s interest in the audiobook space, however. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248393/spotify-audiobook-exclusive-recordings-david-dobrick-hilary-swank"&gt;worked with&lt;/a&gt; YouTubers and celebrities in January to distribute readings of classic books, like &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21247804/harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-reading-philosophers-stone-spotify-video"&gt;partnered with J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World&lt;/a&gt; to release &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone &lt;/em&gt;in audio form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YskJj"&gt;Most importantly, the acquisition will give Spotify a new way to make money while staying in the audio business. Findaway shares in authors’ royalties, which means that whenever someone buys a Findaway-distributed book on the platform, Spotify will make money. It’ll also take some cut of revenue when people buy a book on the platform, like any retailer. (A spokesperson declined to comment on its monetization plans.) It seems possible Spotify could launch new subscription tiers, similarly to Audible, to account for audiobook consumption. Notably, however, Spotify will also have to pay royalties to other audiobook distributors and authors, similar to how it treats music content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo2VSE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 11/11, 4:5 ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story initially stated that Spotify would make money when people streamed an audiobook. It should have said when they buy one. We regret the error and have corrected it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
