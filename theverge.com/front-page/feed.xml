    <title>Floods, fires, and extreme heat: disaster pile-ups are the new norm</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The forecast for the future is a deluge of disasters&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dca39N"&gt;Extreme heat, fires, flash floods, intense rain, hurricane-force winds, and tornadoes left people reeling from coast to coast across the US this week. Each event on its own is dangerous. Striking all at once or in quick succession, the sum of the disasters grows monstrous, overwhelming communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UB6YUJ"&gt;“What we’re learning is that the unthinkable may have always been more likely than we wanted to admit — and with climate change, it becomes much more likely,” says Radley Horton, a research professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who studies climate extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A65vgX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The unthinkable may have always been more likely than we wanted to admit — and with climate change, it becomes much more likely.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cocaGi"&gt;A pile-up of catastrophes is called a “compound event,” and it’s something that’s testing humanity’s limits as climate change supercharges extreme weather around the globe. Existing infrastructure wasn’t built for this kind of punishment, and even the most experienced first responders are faced with scenarios no one has ever seen before. Before they can even catch their breath from one crisis, it seems, communities are dealt another blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJw30"&gt;Hurricane Ida is already a case study in compound events. The storm’s floodwaters drowned neighborhoods along the Gulf Coast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647037/hurricane-ida-rapid-intensification-louisiana-storm"&gt;early in the week&lt;/a&gt;. Ida’s 150 mph winds toppled power lines and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22650382/new-orleans-lousiana-gas-plant-entergy-power-outage-hurricane-ida-electricity-grid"&gt;wreaked havoc on the electricity grid&lt;/a&gt;. As if that wasn’t enough, &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/news/2021-08-31/heat-advisories-issued-across-gulf-coast-with-power-water-still-out-after-hurricane-ida"&gt;dangerous levels of heat and humidity&lt;/a&gt; settled in once the storm passed, leaving many residents in Louisiana and Mississippi sweating it out in wrecked neighborhoods without power or air conditioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgztlZ"&gt;“This is a type of event, definitely we can expect to happen more often,”  says Jakob Zscheischler, an Earth system scientist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. “Even if the number of hurricanes don’t change in the future, the likelihood that they are followed by extreme heat is much higher because global temperature is rising.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3VE25M"&gt;Ida barreled northward after striking the South, pummeling states that had just received record levels of rain the week before. As more rain poured into a sodden Tennessee, organizers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bonnaroo/status/1432805468272005130"&gt;cancelled the Bonnaroo music festival&lt;/a&gt;, citing a ‘tremendous amount of rain’ that left campgrounds flooded. People are still living under tarps after massive flooding in the state last week. Further north, streets became rivers in New York City, which recorded its rainiest hour on record. That record had been set less than two weeks before when &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/nyregion/nyc-rain-storm-flooding-weather.html"&gt;Hurricane Henri hit&lt;/a&gt; the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04GLAj"&gt;Meanwhile, the western part of the country is coping with a one-two punch of drought and heat, which also sets the stage for massive infernos. Residents are being asked to curb their water use while enduring summer heatwaves. They might not have air conditioning at times because of preemptive blackouts aimed at preventing power lines from sparking a blaze. Then, when wildfires do explode, it saddles them with yet another growing &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/08/23/wildfire-smoke-early-births/#:~:text=The%20findings%20underscore%20the%20value,should%20avoid%20very%20smoky%20air.&amp;amp;text=Exposure%20to%20wildfire%20smoke%20during,new%20Stanford%20University%20study%20suggests."&gt;public health disaster&lt;/a&gt;: air laden with soot and pollution and from wildfire smoke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NEYSY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;None of these events are random strokes of bad luck&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hXZrmM"&gt;From the storms in the East to the fires in the West, none of these events are random strokes of bad luck. They are tied together by the worsening climate crisis. Human activity — namely the burning of fossil fuels — is the main driver behind an uptick in extreme weather, a&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt; major United Nations climate report said definitively&lt;/a&gt; last month. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels trap heat; that heat drives up summer temperatures and gives storms more energy. Climate change has also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt; souped up the water cycle&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to more droughts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more downpours. Compound events are likely to become more common, the report predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzB9Gg"&gt;“They are called extreme events because they’re a big deviation from the norm, but they are becoming the norm,” says Michael Oppenheimer, director of the Center for Policy Research on Energy and Environment at Princeton University. “We have to deal with the fallout of a new event before we’re finished dealing with the fallout of the previous event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuOIUS"&gt;Communities will have to adapt to that new reality by looking at the big picture rather than focusing on each extreme event individually — drought &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;fire, storm &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;heat, rain &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;more rain. Small communities &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/climate/climate-towns-bankruptcy.html"&gt;are going bankrupt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports, after being pushed to the edge by storms and conflagrations. Other small towns, like Paradise and Greenville in California, have nearly been scorched off the map completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4Qkrg"&gt;But how can society prepare for these compound events — worst-case scenarios that might be beyond our current realm of experience? “That’s the million dollar question that I think we’re late to the game in asking,” Horton says. “You need to have rainy day funds, whether it’s literally, financially speaking, or whether it’s investing in more resilient infrastructure, more emergency service people, and not waiting until a crisis happens,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e0aS1y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The million dollar question”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J20utP"&gt;That might mean changes to how we respond to disasters. In the past, federal agencies like FEMA might have been able to focus their resources on the aftermath of a single superstorm during a hurricane season. As climate change makes storms stronger, it stretches those resources thin. We saw this in 2017 when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico weeks after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma devastated the mainland (Irma also struck Puerto Rico), and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-the-response-to-hurricane-maria-compared-to-harvey-and-irma/"&gt;FEMA sent&lt;/a&gt; haggard workers and inexperienced trainees to cope with the fallout from Maria on the island territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfyW2m"&gt;Even beyond responding to and recovering from disaster, compound events also change risk assessments for everyday decisions like where to build new homes and buildings. “We should never, ever build in a city or expand without the system being built in a way that recognizes and is able to deal with the anticipated effects of climate change,” Oppenheimer says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PVQJQV"&gt;Another part of developing new risk assessments involves figuring out who is most at risk. Black Americans, in particular, will likely face more severe effects of climate change compared to all other demographic groups, according to &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-report-shows-disproportionate-impacts-climate-change-socially-vulnerable"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; published by the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday. They often live in neighborhoods that can climb several degrees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;hotter than other areas&lt;/a&gt; because of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;history of segregation and disinvestment&lt;/a&gt;, previous research has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRTyOj"&gt;“The impacts of climate change that we are feeling today, from extreme heat to flooding to severe storms, are expected to get worse, and people least able to prepare and cope are disproportionately exposed,” EPA administrator Michael Regan said in a press release.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik4uiA"&gt;We’ll ultimately need compound solutions to all these compound risks, experts say. That includes bigger rainy day funds and beefed-up emergency response teams. Cities and infrastructure will need to be built differently, and we might have to abandon some places we used to call home. Humans will have to stop pumping out greenhouse gases that are driving the climate crisis in the first place, Oppenheimer emphasizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="r6ZVhW"&gt;President Joe Biden addressed the nation this past week with an appeal to Congress to pass legislation that will overhaul US infrastructure in light of the week’s brutal climate disasters. “The past few days of Hurricane Ida and the wildfires in the West and the unprecedented flash floods in New York In New Jersey is yet another reminder. These extreme storms, and the climate crisis are here,” he said in a press conference. “We need to be better prepared. We need to act.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefly’s Alpha rocket detonated by Space Force during first launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojxkzIa1JGA1z7W5UyWb2yyDNt8=/129x0:1503x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813537/Screen_Shot_2021_09_03_at_9.51.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7IFlRE"&gt;Small launch company Firefly’s Alpha rocket exploded mid-flight Thursday night, minutes after a clean liftoff during its first attempt to reach space. The rocket was terminated, Space Force officials said, as it began tipping sideways off course just after reaching supersonic speeds. Firefly said it’s working with regulators to investigate the cause of the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaE4I3"&gt;Alpha, a two-stage rocket standing ten stories tall, lifted off from the Vandenberg Space Force base in California at 9:59PM ET on Thursday, aiming to send a payload of tiny private satellites to space at no charge to the owners. The launch was risky — it was Firefly’s first ever mission, so a failure wasn’t a big surprise. Two and a half minutes after liftoff, the rocket fell short of reaching its maximum aerodynamic pressure and began swinging to the side, tipping horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7aoe4e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we will be diligent in our investigation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A3E2Cl"&gt;At that point the rocket exploded, a dramatic result of &lt;a href="https://www.vandenberg.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2763829/firefly-alpha-terminated-mid-flight/"&gt;Space Launch Delta 30&lt;/a&gt; stepping in to terminate the launch vehicle to prevent it from becoming a hazard to the public. In a statement, Firefly said it was too early to know what caused the mishap, and that “we will be diligent in our investigation” with the Space Force and the Federal Aviation Administration. “We are happy to report that there were no injuries associated with the anomaly,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MdmRtB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Video: Firefly Alpha's in-flight anomaly. Stay tuned to the NSF youtube channel for the full video. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASASpaceflight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ck4fB98Xbc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ck4fB98Xbc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jack Beyer (@thejackbeyer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thejackbeyer/status/1433618654889865216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K6HHXb"&gt;Firefly said it achieved a number of key mission objectives despite the explosion, including a successful first stage ignition, clean liftoff from the pad, and “progression to supersonic speed.” All those points, it said, generated test flight data that will help the company move forward with the rocket’s testing and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9SYR8"&gt;Under development for roughly a decade, Alpha is the company’s centerpiece rocket designed to launch tiny satellites to space, serving as one of a handful of small launchers across the industry that are in their infancy, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647094/astra-rocket-lv0006-launch-failed"&gt;Astra’s “Rocket 3”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21300782/relativity-space-launch-site-air-force-base-terran-1-rocket-3d-printing"&gt;Relativity’s Terran 1&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha, a bit bigger than its rival rockets, is powered by four of the company’s Reaver engines and designed to send 2,200 pounds of payload to low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSLUir"&gt;Firefly aims to sell a dedicated launch on Alpha for $15 million. Once operational, it’ll be able to loft heavier payloads to space than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306971/rocket-lab-neutron-public-spac"&gt;Rocket Lab’s&lt;/a&gt; Electron rocket, which is well into its operational life, or Virgin Orbit’s air-launched LauncherOne rocket, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557103/watch-virgin-orbit-launch-debut-commercial-mission-richard-branson"&gt;shot its first commercial payload to space in June&lt;/a&gt;. All these rockets are tailored to sate growing demand for launch services from the small satellite industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: the changes coming to Apple’s App Store policies </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YTvUjlMw5ZlQAjAPr8-N4KPBxFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813474/acastro_210831_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wQBcti"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNmyeC"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn chats with managing editor Alex Cranz, and news editor Chaim Gartenberg to explain the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;changing Apple App Store policies&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone app developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="osAyEf"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP6404645959&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YrYT0G"&gt;Among the changes: Apple will now let developers of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;“reader” apps directly link their customers to their own sign-up website&lt;/a&gt;, where they could potentially bypass the 30 percent cut from Apple. The crew discuss what this and the other proposed changes means for Apple’s relationship with users and app developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJdaTV"&gt;Second half of the show, the topic moves to Microsoft — Windows 11 will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;release on October 5th&lt;/a&gt; and the PCs that will officially support it are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651851/microsoft-windows-11-testing-pcs-requirements-changes"&gt;still questionable&lt;/a&gt;. The crew discuss this and the rumors about what Microsoft will showcase at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651859/microsoft-surface-event-date"&gt;upcoming Surface event&lt;/a&gt; on September 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6uga5"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647252/the-iphone-13-5g-leo-satellite"&gt;more iPhone 13 rumors&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s alien invasion culminates with another season-ending live event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZIGgEisgvwcb8aJW7I9eQgQxNo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813283/EN_OpSkyFire_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O8kwRR"&gt;Ever since &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;debuted in June&lt;/a&gt;, there has been the promise of a massive conflict with a group of aliens. Now developer Epic is finally teasing that big event in the form of “Operation: Sky Fire.” The live event will be taking place on September 12th at 4PM ET, and Epic says that players will “join a strike team and sneak aboard the Mothership to deliver IO’s final message to the invading aliens.” It will also be a one-time only thing: if you miss it, you’ll have to catch up on YouTube. As always, Epic is recommending players log in early to get a spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uk20q5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f29Kge"&gt;The kinds of live events have long been a highlight of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; experience, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521122/fortnite-rocket-launch-epic-games-dimensional-rift"&gt;dating back to the original rocket launch in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Since then players have witnessed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/4/18529463/fortnite-unvaulting-volcano-eruption-tilted-towers-destroyed-season-9"&gt;erupting volcanos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot"&gt;battling giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21292876/fortnite-chapter-2-season-3-splashdown-launched-trailer-battle-pass"&gt;a flood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;the infamous black hole&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;participated in a battle with Marvel supervillain Galactus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;Epic has even experimented with single-player events&lt;/a&gt;. The upcoming alien event has been teased for some time, with a giant mothership hovering quietly over the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island for months; several locations have also been destroyed by the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfhmro"&gt;The event will also mark the end of season 7 of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which means that if you still have battle pass characters to unlock or gold bars to spend, you’ll want to do it before September 12th. Outside of aliens, this season has featured some notable &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; moments, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;an Ariana Grande concert series&lt;/a&gt; and the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633239/epic-fortnite-impostors-among-us-stole-idea"&gt;a controversial mode called Impostors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays controversial child protection features after privacy outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwPB_bhwTp-Vi8kMOGMoIFLiXRQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813219/acstro_190902_apple_event_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple delays controversial child protection features | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oJ8tHn"&gt;Apple is delaying its child protection features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt;, including a controversial feature that would scan users’ photos for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), following intense criticism that the changes could diminish user privacy. The changes had been scheduled to roll out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNAUVa"&gt;“Last month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material,” Apple said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mgbHgI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a major reversal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt0z5g"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;original press release&lt;/a&gt; about the changes, which were intended to reduce the proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), has a similar statement at the top of the page. That release detailed three major changes in the works. One change to Search and Siri would point to resources to prevent CSAM if a user searched for information related it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM9y14"&gt;The other two changes came under more significant scrutiny. One would alert parents when their kids were receiving or sending sexually explicit photos and would blur those images for kids. The other would have scanned images stored in a user’s iCloud Photos for CSAM and report them to Apple moderators, who could then refer the reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XFARfH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="krYwm4"&gt;Apple detailed the iCloud Photo scanning system at length to make the case that it didn’t weaken user privacy. In short, it scanned photos stored in iCloud Photos on your iOS device and would assess those photos alongside a database of known CSAM image hashes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623859/apple-icloud-photos-csam-scanning-security-multiple-jurisdictions-safeguard"&gt;NCMEC and other child safety organizations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0qN8B"&gt;Still, many privacy and security experts heavily criticized the company for the new system, arguing that it could have created an on-device surveillance system and that it violated the trust users had put in Apple for protecting on-device privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EE6CaL"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation said in an August 5th &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that the new system, however well-intended, would “break key promises of the messenger’s encryption itself and open the door to broader abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNKXWe"&gt;“Apple is compromising the phone that you and I own and operate,” said &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/apples-mistake/"&gt;Ben Thompson at &lt;em&gt;Stratechery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in his own criticism, “without any of us having a say in the matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpaNg1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Android 12 lets you customize your phone’s color palette</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x49FhDfAF3VBtXRsh9ayn-VSvto=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813043/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lx6SOs"&gt;One of the new features in Android 12 is the ability to automatically fit your phone’s color palette to that of your wallpaper. If you’ve been able to upgrade to Android 12, you may want to give it a try, especially if you’re into styling and colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utJkHB"&gt;I tried it out on a Pixel 3 using Android 12 beta, and the results were interesting. When I used the sample wallpapers supplied by Google and enabled the “themed icons” feature (which is supposed to let your icons match the style of your wallpaper), I was treated to a new background color which appeared on the search field at the bottom of the screen, the Quick Tiles (the buttons you get when you swipe down from the top), and other elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgkqvj"&gt;I was not all that impressed by the “themed icons” feature — it basically changed some, but not all, of the icons on my home page into black designs against a hued background. Quite honestly, I think the normal multi-colored icons look much better, but it’s nice to have the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eddw8V"&gt;Want to try it out yourself? Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="72152t"&gt;Long press on an empty part of your home screen until you see the pop-up menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lxz3vf"&gt;Select “Wallpaper &amp;amp; style.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ru2FHO"&gt;Select “Change wallpaper.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press for a pop-up menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2KiZaJrP0AEqi6sci2B3-Bf3KQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823528/Screenshot_20210902_153520.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press for a pop-up menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Change wallpaper.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ttZAMqp-omqKrZOvKhbw9NwErk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823529/Screenshot_20210902_103222.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Change wallpaper.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZBNNiT"&gt;Tap on one of the categories presented on the Wallpaper screen, and then select a specific image. Or tap on the top button called “My photos” to select one of your own photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pH9uwe"&gt;Once you select your image, you’ll be shown a preview of what it will look like on your home screen and lock screen. (Two buttons below the preview image let you toggle between the two.) If you’re satisfied, tap the check mark in the bottom right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jZxm5h"&gt;A pop-up menu will give you the choice of using the wallpaper on the home screen, your lock screen, or both. And you’re done! You’ll find yourself back on your home page — with your new wallpaper. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose a supplied image or pull one from your photos." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxM793QG-qTB9ufCq7mN3EtI0Uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823531/Screenshot_20210902_110943.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a supplied image or pull one from your photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can use see what it will look like on your home screen and lock screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6I3TjicpqpVVRZPpzWQDvaJdPW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823536/Screenshot_20210902_111910.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use see what it will look like on your home screen and lock screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MdwB8a"&gt;If you want to try the themed icons, or use a dark theme, go back to the “Wallpaper &amp;amp; style” page, scroll down a bit and toggle on either or both. Here’s what the Mandalorian wallpaper looks like, both with normal app icons and with the themed icons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The home screen with normal icons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gt1dczzUbijEujVJDDjycFgr6O0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823565/Screenshot_20210902_111952.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen with normal icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The home screen with themed icons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejiUj9Fd-wtcxVN6I0ZhVG7dpOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823574/Screenshot_20210902_155009.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen with themed icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80vCy8"&gt;I also tried the new color palette feature with one of my own photos as wallpaper: a green lawn with a few purple flowers. It worked perfectly there as well. The quick tiles and themed icons were all assigned a pale green, as were the lock screen numerals and other elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When I used a personal photo, it chose a matching theme color." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2pG36yTq8ZtVly_mpzx2QHH-II=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823577/Screenshot_20210902_142221.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I used a personal photo, it chose a matching theme color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The theme color is reflected in a number of places, including the Quick Tiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8sikH0"&gt;You can also choose the a different color combination for your theme, depending on your wallpaper photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="NHFQMq"&gt;On the “Wallpaper &amp;amp; style” page, select “Wallpaper colors” and choose one of the color combinations shown. You can also tap on “Basic colors” if you want something, well, basic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or choose something basic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkMy5a"&gt;While these style combinations won’t affect your phone’s efficiency or performance, the idea that you can tweak the look of your screen to suit your taste — or your mood — is rather nice. If you have access to Android 12, I’d try it out — it may make a real difference in how you view your Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shang-Chi could suffer because Marvel can’t push pause on its big story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Actor Simu Liu in a fighting pose." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtqyP_4uTkJuPIkcWSon5ieMvPU=/761x0:3335x1716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69812796/BUS3520_cmp_lum_v0045.1069_R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6D2KhR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634609/marvel-shang-chi-ten-rings-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an important film for Marvel for lots of reasons. It’s the studio’s first return to theatrical exclusive release after over a year and a half of delays due to COVID-19 (which included shifting &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; to Disney Plus as well as theaters). It’s the studio’s first film with an Asian lead, a long-awaited milestone that took over a decade for the company to actually accomplish. And it marks the “real” start of its Phase 4 films, advancing the future of the MCU with fresh stories post-&lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z584A"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; — and its less-than-ideal release timing, coming as theaters are seeing smaller turnouts as the delta variant continues to spike in the US — also highlights the MCU’s biggest problem: its films and shows are too interconnected for Marvel to shift around or delay releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SI0z0T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some spoilers ahead for current and future MCU projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH4gJB"&gt;This isn’t a new issue. The past year and its series of cascading delays have shown just how difficult it can be to schedule films. But Marvel’s movies have an additional challenge — not only do they have to avoid interfering with other major studio releases from across Disney’s slate, but they also have to thread the delicate balance of the other theatrical and streaming Marvel releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qmElEj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tf3LJd"&gt;Take &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt;, for example. The following factors are all true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cTfqvx"&gt;In an ideal world, Disney would prefer to release Marvel movies in theaters, where they can rake in hundreds of millions — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/5/18529601/avengers-endgame-marvel-disney-box-office-2-billion-worldwide"&gt;or even billions&lt;/a&gt; — of dollars in box office revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nYqpXI"&gt;This is not an ideal world, and even if &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; defies expectations, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/black-widow-mcu-record-second-weekend-box-office-drop-disney-piracy-1234795325/"&gt;it won’t make the kind of money&lt;/a&gt; it could have in more normal times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gosBgf"&gt;Given the surge in COVID cases in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/delta-variant-disrupts-moviegoing-comfort-levels-1234992378/"&gt;this coming weekend is an especially bad time&lt;/a&gt; to be releasing a movie in theaters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5mKphR"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shang-chi-debut-theatres-despite-covid"&gt;Disney has already made distribution agreements with theaters&lt;/a&gt; to release &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt;, which it can’t (or is unwilling to) change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xhLT6F"&gt;Disney needs to work with theaters in the future for those $1 billion-plus releases when things do get back to normal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PIXoCd"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; has to come out where it does in Marvel’s release order, given its place in the overall MCU storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bDEngI"&gt;Disney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;can’t delay major MCU releases&lt;/a&gt; without having to rework much (if not all) of its Disney Plus and theatrical schedule. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vINlhu"&gt;The end result: Disney is stuck with the worst-case scenario. It has to release &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; in theaters, it can’t use it to (immediately) boost Disney Plus subscriptions or get more data on hybrid releases, and it’ll probably take a hit on the box office numbers just to keep things on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2Lrbc"&gt;But the issue isn’t going away, either. Consider what we &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; know about Marvel’s upcoming movies and shows. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXcRqA26xdQdMtzFXUQuIqtNpAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708798/9b242b6fdd726ace32e612d5a40e6028_4096x2727_1c974df6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l2g0IP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; had to be released before &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; hit Disney Plus, which it’s scheduled to do in November. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638877/spider-man-no-way-home-first-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has to be before &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the added complication that Sony, not Marvel, is in charge of release — if Sony delays it, it’ll throw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417115/marvel-eternals-chloe-zhao-oscar-winner-teaser-footage-black-panther-captain-marvel-sequels"&gt;Marvel’s next wave of films in disarray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSHPfL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; has to be before the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt; (which is a Disney Plus release and has the time constraint of being released near December 2022), which in turn has to be out before &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt;. The upcoming &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel &lt;/em&gt;TV show has to be out before &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; sequel &lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Loki’&lt;/em&gt;s second season will presumably set up events for &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; (which is already confirmed to feature the return of Kang the Conqueror, who was first introduced in &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzgTKK"&gt;And that’s not even going into reports that &lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; will somehow &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ironheart-black-panther-wakanda-forever-1235045088/"&gt;tie into the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever the plans are with an upcoming fourth &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22631179/marvel-captain-america-4-release-date-anthony-mackie-avengers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; starring Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson (which could impact future Disney Plus shows). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cg4q7hsqP3d3Jm371jnQBNXcmsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717284/tra8660_105_trl_comp_v004_7f1c1cb3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u6GDGD"&gt;Marvel is stuck in a problematic cycle of its own making. The Disney Plus shows have to wait for the movies, the movies are the big money-makers and have to wait for theaters, so they get delayed, but Marvel can’t afford to delay the Disney Plus shows since they’re among the biggest draws for keeping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;paying subscribers to the service&lt;/a&gt;, which is an increasingly important part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21247794/disney-plus-subscribers-earnings-q2-theatrical-parks-streaming-movies-delays"&gt;business strategy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1UrmU"&gt;And while box office billions are good, the company also has to consider keeping Disney Plus releases consistent. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— the current Marvel show — ends in October, and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22558074/hawkeye-disney-plus-marvel-november-24th-release-date-announcement"&gt;cued up for November&lt;/a&gt; already. Since MCU shows started airing on Disney Plus, there’s only been a single month (May 2020) when there wasn’t at least one new episode of a Marvel show on the service, a streak that the company looks like it’ll continue through the end of 2021 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaPXP8"&gt;Ultimately, something has to give: do you release things in theaters early, sacrificing some box office to keep Disney Plus on track? Or delay everything, giving subscribers a chance to skip a few months of Disney Plus in hopes that you might get a bigger box office payout in a more normal theatrical environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1H6nca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The MCU’s must-watch nature is a double-edged sword&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdTAjZ"&gt;There’s also the possibility that there is no right answer. Disney may see the numbers from &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; and decide to shift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a hybrid release or a full streaming exclusive through Premiere Access if it thinks the numbers don’t work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXxw8A"&gt;The MCU’s interconnected storytelling has been one of its biggest boons, drawing on a comic book-style strategy to make every installment a must-watch, as essential to getting the full story as each issue in a long-running series. But in 2021’s complex web of streaming, theatrical releases, and ever-shifting release dates, that connected nature is increasingly becoming a problem that not even the most popular heroes can solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzA4Px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCZ2pY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zxs1rWSTamEwA3o5dlvxDuyv1eQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69812654/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Like hire more than 500 people to police an entire platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4uBPJE"&gt;When you spend money in Apple’s App Store, the company generally takes a 30 percent cut — one that adds up to an estimated $19 billion per year. Apple’s currently in the fight of its life to prove to judges, government regulators, and its own developers that it deserves those dollars, but not everyone’s buying it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXvz2X"&gt;Over the past seven days alone, South Korea declared its disbelief on the global stage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passing a landmark bill&lt;/a&gt; that could keep Apple and Google from directly collecting their 30 percent cut, and may inspire other governments to do the same. Developers also expressed their rage at an Apple press release, where the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;spun its agreement to settle a lawsuit for $100 million as a $100 million fund for developers&lt;/a&gt; — while quietly promising 30 million of those dollars to the lawyers and enacting no truly significant changes. The CEO of Hopscotch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamJ0hn/status/1431001795904561160"&gt;shared her story&lt;/a&gt; of how Apple’s App Store review team repeatedly gaslit her, insisting there was an issue with the well-liked kids coding app that didn’t actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dBidQy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What does Apple’s 30 percent buy you?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="56x8wm"&gt;On Wednesday, Apple made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;a slightly more significant concession for (big) developers&lt;/a&gt;, and as Nick Heer writes, &lt;a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/reader-apps-external-subscriptions/"&gt;the company seems to have momentarily dropped its smug tone&lt;/a&gt;. But we don’t need to get into complex developer negotiations to point out the head-bangingly obvious ways Apple is falling down on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcpu9e"&gt;While the company claims the App Store is “curated by experts,” that it is “a safe and trusted place to discover and download apps,” and that it holds apps to “the highest standards for privacy, security, and content,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the company’s own emails&lt;/a&gt; paint a different picture. They show that Apple &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;for years&lt;/em&gt; about the exact kind of egregious scams that bilk iPhone users out of millions of dollars, long before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;our report&lt;/a&gt;, and yet they keep failing to stop them from invading the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Usc0zv"&gt;It bears repeating: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;Apple is the most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/a&gt;. The company currently makes $10,000 &lt;em&gt;every second&lt;/em&gt; on average, $3,600 of which is profit, a large portion of which comes from the App Store itself. (The App Store alone has been a bigger business than the Mac or iPad since 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;see #10 here&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te03HY"&gt;If Apple wanted to change this system, it could. But I expect Apple will only be dragged kicking and screaming into a world with a more functional App Store, because it seems incapable of taking the blindingly obvious steps that might better protect its users — again, despite being the most valuable and profitable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240ykh"&gt;Here are eight to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ltL8Vo"&gt;1. Hire an App Review team big enough to actually do the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ8UlH"&gt;Apple has 500 app reviewers. Just 500 against the entire world; 500 human beings expected to process 100,000 apps per week with some help from automated tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qGlTN"&gt;Even if you were to give Apple the benefit of the doubt and assume that every one of them is a skilled, savvy surveyor sussing out scams in a snap, the math barely makes sense. Even though App Store reviewers typically work 10-hour days (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#68&lt;/a&gt;), the sheer volume of apps means each reviewer would only get 15 minutes to evaluate each app — and only then if they worked without taking any breaks. (Documents also suggest they may work quite a bit of overtime.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8b5o8o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a wetware rate limiting service and nothing more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BnM9pK"&gt;Emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial suggest App Review isn’t necessarily that savvy either, with Apple head of fraud Eric Friedman calling the department “a wetware rate limiting service and nothing more” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#60&lt;/a&gt;), and suggesting its goal is simply to get apps through the pipe. Other documents from the trial seem to back up that idea, repeatedly showing how the App Review team continually pushed for a faster “SLA” (service level agreement, a guarantee that it would review apps in a certain period of time) and sometimes made mistakes when they were working too quickly (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#65&lt;/a&gt;), letting bad apps into the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLUdjJ"&gt;How big should Apple’s App Review team actually be? Hard to say, but Facebook says it has upwards of 15,000 content moderators, Google tells us it has over 20,000 reviewers across its many services, and even Twitter has 2,200 checkers, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="020x4v"&gt;These other platforms admittedly have far more messages than Apple to review — but then again, none of them claim to offer “the highest standards for privacy, security and content” while testing entire programs that run on a pocket computer. Apple could likely do a better job with more reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHxgy5"&gt;And again, Apple is &lt;em&gt;the most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/em&gt;, unlike, say, Twitter. It’s pretty easy to argue that the number of moderators should be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NygPZk"&gt;2. Police its most profitable apps for fraud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sJVeyR"&gt;This isn’t rocket science. Anyone can do it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;I did it&lt;/a&gt;. You can too. Just look for the apps on the App Store that are making the most money, find ones with suspicious user reviews, and inspect them for stupidly high subscription prices — say, $9.99 every single week for a wallpaper app that just repackages wallpapers you can download for free online. Congrats, you’ve found a scam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfPJDp"&gt;The head of Apple’s App Review program wrote in January 2018 that “We need to think about how to stop this from happening,” referencing an entire 32-page presentation about how to trick users into paying for recurring subscriptions using apps that harvest wallpaper, horoscopes, and ringtones off the internet for free. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#64&lt;/a&gt;) Yet we saw those same exact scams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;still running three years later&lt;/a&gt;. When I asked Apple whether it ever goes back to check its top grossing apps for fraud, the company wouldn’t give me a straight answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pGChJ"&gt;3. Automatic scam refunds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv245B"&gt;A dark thought crossed my mind while reporting on App Store scams: maybe Apple doesn’t stop them because it’s more profitable to look the other way. There’s no evidence of that, but you know what Apple could do to eliminate that ugly idea entirely? Universal automatic scam refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BK3eq"&gt;When Apple retroactively removes scammy apps from the App Store — as it sometimes does when journalists and developers call them out — it should automatically give people back their money, and warn them to stop using those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6f26b"&gt;That clearly isn’t what Apple does today. The company told me it has to review fraud on a case-by-case basis (read: not automatically) even when I specifically pointed out that Apple VP Kyle Andreer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1385062598178078723"&gt;told Congress under oath that it makes scammed customers whole again&lt;/a&gt;. Customers have the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; for refunds, but how would they even know to do that, or even stop getting scammed, if Apple doesn’t tell them about the fraud? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="df7JEC"&gt;4. Stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="INrgep"&gt;People hate pop-up messages. You know what kind of pop-up messages I &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; hate? Ones that ask me if I’d genuinely like to keep subscribing to an app or service before I get charged for another month. Every single time, I’d know the App Store was looking out for me, instead of looking out for the company that’s secretly hoping I’m the kind of customer who never bothers to check my credit card bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGPBjL"&gt;I don’t expect Apple to actually do this, because I expect it would be losing out on an immense amount of profit, and might drive some of the most lucrative developers away from the platform — the kind that were leaving because they thought Apple already made it too easy to quit their service. But it would immediately fix the problems of so many people who, when they realized they’d been scammed, went to the reviews section of the App Store to complain that they didn’t know how to cancel their subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="llAFmC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Apple truly cared, they’d take the same stance with people’s money as they do with privacy: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t auto-renew subscriptions by default.&lt;a href="https://t.co/DVOViWOtzu"&gt;https://t.co/DVOViWOtzu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382430603270778890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ehIAe"&gt;I think scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382430603270778890"&gt;has it exactly right&lt;/a&gt;: “If Apple truly cared, they’d take the same stance with people’s money as they do with privacy,” the same stance that Apple CEO Steve Jobs himself &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ij-jlF98SzA"&gt;articulated so clearly in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. “Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them,” Jobs said about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jSOniO"&gt;5. Stop selling ads atop App Store search results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="swDlkO"&gt;While it’s hard for me to be entirely sympathetic with Epic Games’ fight to secure more &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; profits, I believe CEO Tim Sweeney got one thing very right years before he sued. It is &lt;em&gt;ridiculous&lt;/em&gt; that the top App Store search result is almost never what you’re searching for — because another developer can pay Apple to take it away from you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYBexY"&gt;Thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZb3cG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Really, how did we get to this state? The store prioritizes ad revenue above user intent, so now developers buy ads in front of each others’ products so that exactly nobody’s search results lead to the actual thing they typed. Who in this cycle isn’t crazy?&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1019859186224594944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B0BPE7"&gt;It seems some developers have gotten wise to this, and by “wise” I mean given into Apple’s greed: Walmart and &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; appear to be paying for the ad slots above their own apps, so searching for them hilariously gives you the same exact app twice in a row. Can you believe Apple’s original plan to give 15 percent back to small developers (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#11&lt;/a&gt;) was to give them store credit for these search ads? “We’ll let you have a portion of the advantage we give to richer companies who pay us” doesn’t sound that generous to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2et1Bg"&gt;These search ads are plainly user-hostile, even if other search providers do it too — and Apple could make a serious statement about its commitment to users by eliminating them from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J08H7N"&gt;6. Lock underage users out of adult apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E0UotH"&gt;In April, we wrote how Apple had unwittingly invited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars%5D"&gt;secret gambling dens into the App Store that masqueraded as games for kids&lt;/a&gt;. Bait-and-switch apps aren’t an easy thing for Apple to protect against, so I can’t call that an egregious failure — though maybe they’d catch more of them if they had more reviewers, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IvNAk"&gt;Anyway, the Tech Transparency Project recently discovered that minors don’t even have to stumble upon a secret gambling den to access illicit content — &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apples-app-store-loopholes-put-children-risk"&gt;the App Store will serve up blatantly adult apps&lt;/a&gt; even if Apple already knows that a user is underage. Creating an Apple ID for a simulated 14-year-old, the Project found 37 adult apps that allowed them to sign up, including dating apps that showed explicit adult content and a casino game, and saw advertisements pop up for additional casino apps that were rated for the 17+ age group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQdwlj"&gt;According to trial documents, Apple’s head of fraud mentioned in February 2020 that the App Store had a problem with child predators, calling it an “under-resourced challenge” and also an “active threat.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#71&lt;/a&gt;). Stopping minors from accessing certain apps wouldn’t be a silver bullet, but it feels like an obvious patch for an embarrassing hole: otherwise, why does Apple bother to collect our ages at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZMdKR9"&gt;7. Bring back the “Report a problem” button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bJqzgW"&gt;And while we’re on the topic of people who actually identify scammy apps in the App Store and leave their unanswered pleas for help there: did you know the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/consumer-electronics/smartphones/iphone/how-to-report-an-app-problem-from-your-iphone/"&gt;used to have an actual “Report a problem” button&lt;/a&gt; on every single app? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSaoMk"&gt;When I asked Apple about this, the company told me &lt;a href="http://reportaproblem.apple.com/"&gt;it still exists&lt;/a&gt;, but it feels like a joke by comparison. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5n5jj9"&gt;The only way to naturally discover the new link is for users to scroll &lt;em&gt;all the way down&lt;/em&gt; to the bottom of the Apps or Games tab. You can’t even access it from your purchases tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2IdYDw"&gt;It doesn’t actually open in the App Store itself; it launches a web browser, where you need to log in again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BuSUQB"&gt;If you pick “Report suspicious activity,” the site redirects you to contact Apple Support instead of actually submitting a report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEDCrt"&gt;If you pick “Report a quality issue,” free-to-download apps are greyed out, with no way to click on them. Apple won’t let you report a scam unless you’ve already fallen for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gDqQ8J"&gt;The only other options are “Request a refund” and “Find my content.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NzYVrn"&gt;If you pick “Request a refund,” it’ll ask you why you think you deserve one, and none of the drop-down options are anything close to “I got scammed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hb0Kz"&gt;It’s possible, even likely, that if Apple allowed &lt;em&gt;just anyone&lt;/em&gt; to report scams it would be inundated by false reports from rival developers. But Apple already fosters an environment where bad actors can game the system: buying up hundreds or thousands of fake star scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wlADW9"&gt;8. Kill off star ratings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MRtYYE"&gt;Star scores make platforms look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. They allow people who like a product to quickly and easily give it a good “review” with a minimum of effort — unlike traditional reviews where many people only bother to write something when they’re frustrated and angry. Star scores can theoretically even out the bias towards negative reviews, making every product on a storefront look better than it would otherwise seem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="j3be36"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stars let scams flourish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiHLwq"&gt;But they &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;allow bad actors to destroy the integrity of the system, because it’s impossible for most people to tell whether an actual user, a robot, or a paid stooge added that 5-star rating. There’s no name to check, no language requirement, no meaningful accountability. So it’s no surprise that some of the most egregious App Store scams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;we described in April&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly thousands of fake 5-star reviews propping them up — to the point that an app with a 4.5-star rating in the App Store would have actually been rated a 1.7 if you looked at the written reviews.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYX4SZ"&gt;So far, Apple’s solution has been to purge fake ratings, and seemingly after the fact. But it could also just purge star scores to begin with, and find a better way — like, say, only allowing positive reviews from people who’ve used an app for a certain length of time. Other platforms like Amazon and Google have similar star score problems; this is an opportunity for Apple to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="viGJxT"&gt;
&lt;p id="pctceP"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; that it stopped $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions before they went through, permanently banned a million accounts, terminated hundreds of thousands of developer accounts, and rejected nearly a million risky apps in 2020 alone. It clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that that $1.5 billion was directly attributable to Apple, too, not just payment processors automatically doing their job. They sound like impressive numbers for a single year on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wR4iQ2"&gt;Also, hours after we published this post, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;Apple agreed to push back its controversial child porn detection features&lt;/a&gt; that had generated a huge outcry, because they broke Apple’s privacy promise in ways privacy advocates feared might lead to a slippery sIope. The company’s clearly listening right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bb3fY"&gt;But the App Store contains far more obvious issues that anyone can see, and it’s clear the company is listening to feedback now. If it wants to justify a 30 percent cut in the name of keeping customers safe, it should embrace some obvious solutions too; ones that vividly show Apple puts people &lt;em&gt;ahead&lt;/em&gt; of profits, instead of the other way around. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philips Hue smart LED bulbs now have more competition from Philips Smart LED bulbs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txLC_tPfxLEbj2GiMTlRLHs58Ao=/0x50:5250x3550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69812531/philips_smart_led_bulb_package.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Philips Hue, the new Philips Smart LED bulbs support millions of colors.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Signify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bvwdf6"&gt;Signify, owner of the Philips Hue brand, today announced the global launch of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.lighting.philips.com%2Fconsumer%2Fsmart-wifi-led&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22654576%2Fphilips-smart-led-bulbs-price-sizes-signify" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Smart LED bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. The new lineup originates from Signify’s 2019 acquisition of &lt;a href="https://www.wizconnected.com/en/consumer/"&gt;Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, and carries the “Wiz Connected” logo on its blue packaging to differentiate it from Hue products. A similar collection of bulbs &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/en-us/our-company/news/press-releases/2020/20200827-wiz-launches-a-brand-new-generation-of-products"&gt;launched in the US at Home Depot stores&lt;/a&gt; at this time last year, only under a slightly tweaked “Philips WiFi LED” name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dv8LPb"&gt;Signify assured &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; during a press briefing that they’ve tested the multitude of Philips smart LED brands with consumers and they weren’t confused. That’s good, because Zigbee-based Philips Hue smart LED bulbs and Wi-Fi-based Philips Smart LED bulbs are not compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WWJsiX_N1SwGNUmrU6uNUKmjfYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823542/PHILIPS_SMART_LED_GLOBAL_LAUNCH.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the many new Philips Smart LED bulbs now available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y5jVUW"&gt;At launch there are 36 products (individual bulbs and multi-packs) launching under the Philips Smart LED brand in Europe that undercut comparable Hue bulbs on price. These include basics like the 60W E27 warm white dimmable bulb for €9.99, a 50W GH10 tunable white frosted spot for €13.99, a 2-pack of 50W GU10 color frosted spots for €29.99, and a gold 25W E27 decorative white filament bulb for €54.99. Signify says that Philips Smart LED bulbs should be available to buy today from most retailers that already sell regular LED bulbs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LYO0RxsOWrseNKZFFbcJLJDNADc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823537/Wiz_range_of_bulbs.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of Wiz-branded bulbs which also includes ceiling and table lights, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5dyVtH"&gt;Signify also sells dozens upon dozens of &lt;a href="https://www.wizconnected.com/en/consumer/products/"&gt;Wiz-branded lights and accessories&lt;/a&gt; that differ in availability by region. The Wiz lighting collection includes temperature- and color-changing bulbs of all sizes, spots, ceiling lights, decorative filaments, lightstrips, and luminaries. Wiz accessories include smart plugs, remotes, motion sensors, and in-wall dimmers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDnWExEYpPicj8mzINEqdxsHe1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22824830/wiz_hero_table_lamp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wiz Hero Gen 2 table lamp is available today in the US and Europe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="98vQaj"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210903-a-home-filled-with-smart-light-signify-unveils-new-easy-to-use-wiz-smart-lighting-products"&gt;added a few new items today&lt;/a&gt; including the Wiz Hero Gen 2 (€49.99 / $49.99) and Squire (€54.99 / $59.99) table lamps, a slim ceiling light, and its first smart plug with an embedded power meter (€19.99) that will let you monitor energy consumption within the Wiz app when it launches on October 1st in Europe and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vR83khad02zLW7_VO-gzTyj486I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823548/ACCESSIBLE_RETAILER_BRAND.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart is also getting in on the Wiz Connected action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IJOg3Y"&gt;Wiz Connected bulbs can also be found from a number of partners. Notably, Walmart Canada sells Wiz Connected bulbs under the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.ca%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dwiz&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22654576%2Fphilips-smart-led-bulbs-price-sizes-signify" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Great Value&lt;/a&gt;” brand. &lt;a href="https://www.liteline.com/page/OnCloud"&gt;Liteline&lt;/a&gt; and the UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.4liteuk.com/products/wiz"&gt;4Lite&lt;/a&gt; are also signed on as a partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h60qS"&gt;As mentioned earlier, the collections are incompatible despite sharing the Philips name: Philips Smart LED bulbs can’t be controlled by the Philips Hue app, and Philips Hue bulbs can’t be controlled by the WiZ app. Fortunately, the Wiz / Philips Smart LED collections, like Philips Hue, supports Alexa and Google Assistant voice assistants, IFTTT, and SmartThings to help mask the incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEeJpY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matter could improve compatibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CrNPD9"&gt;Compatibility across Philips brands could change in the future since both Wiz and Philips Hue have committed to supporting the interoperable Matter smart home protocol when it launches in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;first half of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. However, Signify has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210512-complete-philips-hue-range-to-be-compatible-with-new-smart-home-connectivity-standard-matter"&gt;updating the complete range of Hue devices to Matter&lt;/a&gt;, while only &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/en-ca/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210515-wiz-among-first-smart-lighting-players-to-adopt-industry-unifying-technology-matter"&gt;committing to new devices for Wiz&lt;/a&gt;. That’s likely because all Hue devices will support Matter after updating the Hue Bridge in homes, whereas hub-less Wiz devices must be updated individually since each product is fitted with its own &lt;a href="https://www.wizconnected.com/en/oem/"&gt;WiZ module&lt;/a&gt;. Signify is looking into my query about future interoperability under Matter but didn’t have an answer in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="57Wnpk"&gt;In 1982, Giallo master Dario Argento directed a slasher film called &lt;em&gt;Tenebrae&lt;/em&gt;, or “darkness.” &lt;em&gt;Tenebrae &lt;/em&gt;unfolds like many other Italian horror movies of the period, but in the years after, Argento told interviewers that it actually took place in a near-future where the human race has been depopulated by an unspoken tragedy. It’s a weird and arguably irrelevant addition to the film’s concrete plot — but one that recasts it as part of something bigger and stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGLMZm"&gt;I remembered this bit of trivia after finishing &lt;em&gt;Nightslink,&lt;/em&gt; an enigmatic little game that was released in late August. &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; is about the nocturnal life of an anonymous man referred to as a “nightslink,” which might be a job title, a social role, or an epithet. The nightslink’s job is to visit a seemingly normal apartment building and deliver mysterious audiotapes that are both highly sought and slightly feared. If you read the game’s summary, this is also apparently all taking place after the apocalypse. But &lt;em&gt;Nightslink’s &lt;/em&gt;strength is its delicate, evocative ambiguity — its ability to hint at a story that’s more complex than its half-hour of gameplay could possibly hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjFroF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt;, developed almost entirely by a Portuguese developer known as Noiseminded, is a first-person walking game that’s essentially about knocking on doors. It’s part of a horror subgenre that mimics the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/overview-of-49375996?l=it"&gt;grimy low-poly look&lt;/a&gt; of early PlayStation titles, evoking the 2018 game &lt;em&gt;Paratopic&lt;/em&gt;. (To add to the similarities, &lt;em&gt;Paratopic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; are also both about delivering creepy tapes, although the former is longer and more narratively complicated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hy9PV6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Nightslink’ plays with the ambiguity of its retro aesthetic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y1WYbP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://leafthief.itch.io/turnpike-north/devlog/212145/setting-up-the-hpsxrp"&gt;“haunted PS1”&lt;/a&gt; style has an inherent unreality. Even if a game takes place in the mundane world, its buildings are often flattened into blocky dystopian abstractions, while people and props are pared to their &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt;-functional essence. &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; plays with that uncanniness. Nearly the whole game is set in an empty hallway that seems frozen in the 1980s, its windows looking out onto a fog-wreathed wall of unremarkable tower blocks. But something is deeply wrong with all of this, and it will slowly consume the occupants’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wU4ew"&gt;Over four evenings (apparently, since we never see the daylight), your nightslink appears with a stack of tapes and a list of apartment numbers. The building’s residents hold cryptic, one-sided conversations from behind their doors, hinting at conflicts and aspirations somehow bound up with the tapes. The game is linear, but you can find optional conversations that slightly reshape the story. Its hidden pieces are just visible enough that they’ve drawn me back to &lt;em&gt;Nightslink’s&lt;/em&gt; tiny world several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehj29F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t feel like it’s meant to be totally unraveled. Your conversations reference details that only add to the mystery of how people function in this world. (Who does the man in one apartment work for? Why does the nightslink make these deliveries for free? What kind of apocalypse, exactly, is it post?) Instead, &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; combines game-like exploration with the feel of a short story or film — delivering a narrative that pays off thematically without severing its many loose ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMPykB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nightslink&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; is available for Windows on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1612920/NIGHTSLINK/?ltclid=a5660113-4460-439b-94d1-fc9c594b2e06"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://noiseminded.itch.io/nightslink?ltclid=c9e06641-cc45-4b9b-a09d-f5bf3d971d71"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Itch.io&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
