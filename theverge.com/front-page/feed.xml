    <title>Uber finally recognizes UK driver union in historic agreement </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber Drivers Win Supreme Court Appeal To Be Considered Workers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NLTi80En8gobQMbnSY5shC0ASrM=/0x0:7116x4744/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347985/1231264249.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z1nYvF"&gt;Uber has finally recognized a union of its own drivers. Allow yourself that single moment of elation before we get to the rest of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLi2lj"&gt;GMB trade union in the UK (it’s not really an acronym for anything, as it was shortened from General, Municipal, Boilermakers’ and Allied Trade Union some 40 years ago) managed to clinch union recognition from the jaws of the famously labor-hostile app company today. As &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported, “GMB will have access to drivers’ meeting hubs [...] It will also be able to represent drivers if they lose access to the Uber app, and it will meet quarterly with management to discuss driver issues and concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPkGQS"&gt;It’s not clear whether this arrangement hews closer to traditional union representation as we envision it in the US, or if this more so resembles the Independent Drivers Guild — an outsized advocacy group in New York that meets with Uber and has been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-yorks-rideshare-organizers-clash-amid-unprecedented-1834623838"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; as a company union. Drivers won’t be automatically enrolled in the union as a result of working for Uber. That’s an arrangement we’d refer to as an “open shop” on this side of the Atlantic, and the company is almost assured to leverage it to its benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9Hjmg"&gt;Drivers in the UK &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html"&gt;recently won&lt;/a&gt; — via the courts — the right to be considered Uber “workers,” a category distinct from “employees” but which still confers basic employment benefits like minimum wage and a pension. However, that ruling did not apply to couriers on the Uber Eats food delivery side, nor does this new union agreement cover them. From the start then, this new agreement leaves an estimated 30,000 Uber laborers out in the cold. (We’ve reached out to GMB and Uber for additional details on that oversight.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq13oz"&gt;GMB has undoubtedly made history here, but Uber’s track record gives onlookers every reason to doubt the efficacy of this new union. The company has a habit of threatening to pull out of locations that fail to provide the legal favoritism it has come to expect — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-threatens-to-leave-quebec-over-driver-rules-1506453196"&gt;Quebec in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, for example. It has also been engaged in attempts to rewrite labor law in the US to suit its business interests, successfully &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;overturning a California law&lt;/a&gt; via a ballot proposition during the 2020 election which cost the company — along with fellow travelers Lyft, DoorDash, and Postmates — an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike"&gt;estimated $200 million&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, drivers in the state have reported their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/16/uber-lyft-drivers-california-prop-22"&gt;wages falling&lt;/a&gt; even further. (Uber is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/labor-gig-companies-are-said-to-be-near-bargaining-deal-in-n-y"&gt;attempting&lt;/a&gt; a similar legal maneuver in New York currently.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuTjxc"&gt;Further compounding matters, one of the parties which helped win worker status for UK drivers — the App Drivers &amp;amp; Couriers Union — refused to sign on to a similar deal for recognition, claiming &lt;a href="https://www.adcu.org.uk/news-posts/uber-gmb-union"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it believes “closer trade union engagement with Uber management is always a welcome development but there is good reason for workers and their unions to be cautious.” The group cited Uber’s continued hostility toward workers, in and out of court, in the UK and in the US. “For us compliance with legal minimums should be the point of departure for any union agreement with Uber,” the ADCU wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaMshQ"&gt;Still, a win is a win. “This ground-breaking deal between GMB and Uber could be the first step to a fairer working life for millions of people,” the delightfully named GMB national officer Mick Rix noted in identical press releases sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by both the union and Uber, “We now call on all other operators to follow suit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BrMM5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2AYHH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SanDisk’s new card reader dock is all I could ever want and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3sBxriZVVgGB_cYWXV309h5ml4w=/0x166:4000x2833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347893/SanDiskProfessionalPRO_DOCK4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sandisk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AgW1lb"&gt;Western Digital, owner of the SanDisk brand, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fcompany%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F2021-05-26-western-digital-debuts-sandisk-professional-brand&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22455534%2Fsandisk-pro-dock-4-video-workflow-lexar-sd-cfast-cards-thunderbolt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new product called the Pro-Dock 4, and it’s all I’ve ever wanted in a card reading solution: it lets you mix and match four card reading modules, which can all be read simultaneously, and connect them all to your computer using a single Thunderbolt 3 cable. This dock not only fills the hole that was left in my heart by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-Workflow-Thunderbolt-LRWHR2RBNA/dp/B00KYK1KZK/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=lexar%2Bworkflow&amp;amp;qid=1622063026&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lexar’s Workflow hub&lt;/a&gt;, but it makes me completely forget it existed: the Workflow didn’t have Thunderbolt daisy-chaining or a 260W power supply for charging devices and accessories (though I will admit that Lexar’s SSD modules were kind of neat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XRtB6"&gt;SanDisk says it’ll be making modules for the dock that support CFast, CFexpress, Red’s Mini-Mags, CF, microSD, and SD formats. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xgli01byarUz4LlcC9BjUVRhJU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541842/SanDiskProfesssionalPRO_READER_Family_stacked.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SanDisk&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SanDisk’s readers, which work independently or as part of the dock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DzcZtQ"&gt;The modules themselves will be available individually, which is great for a few reasons. For one, it lets you mix and match your dock’s card reading abilities: mainly shoot Red but use a Canon R6 as a B-cam? You can load up three Red Mini-Mag readers and a combo SD / microSD / CF card reader. If you’re all-in on CFast, you could load up four of those readers. And if you change what you’re shooting with in the future, you can buy new modules instead of having to get a whole new dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19dBcn"&gt;The modularity also allows for portability. If you’re going to a location and just need to bring along one reader, you can pop it out of the dock and take it along with you — the individual readers use USB-C 10Gbps to connect to either your computer or the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b7TZW"&gt;To be clear, I’m not a video or photo professional, and I certainly don’t need this much card-reading capacity. I’ve never even held half the cards these things can read. But does that stop me from wanting one of these docks, loaded out with enough card readers to dump every SD card I own at once? Absolutely not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ES4zlp"&gt;The prices for the dock and readers haven’t yet been announced, but SanDisk expects them to go on sale this summer. Lexar’s hub &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/11546/lexar-professional-workflow-hr2-4bay-thunderbolt-2-usb-30-reader-hub-review/8"&gt;cost around $200&lt;/a&gt; at launch, plus the price of modules (I paid around $40 for the XQD module), and it did way less. I can only wait in fear to see the price tag of SanDisk’s version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stadia’s loss is Clubhouse’s gain: the social audio company has poached a longtime Google engineer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yM6Qk9Be2eeGDOm6aDjde3w5log=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347831/acastro_210430_1777_audioApps_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J0jRVa"&gt;Clubhouse has hired Justin Uberti, creator of the WebRTC standard and the Google Duo video chat app. He leaves Google after nearly 15 years at the company, where he was most recently the engineering lead for Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service and led the team that made the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176273/google-stadia-ios-beta-live-now-mobile-safari-iphone-ipad-cloud-gaming"&gt;Stadia iOS web app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHQ7rB"&gt;“Justin is a phenomenal engineering leader and one of the original inventors of WebRTC, on top of which Clubhouse is built,” Clubhouse co-founder and CTO Rohan Seth said in a statement. “There’s so much that goes into crafting a fantastic audio experience — the quality, the latency, the ability to use spatial distance when multiple speakers are talking. This will be a critical area of investment for us as we open Clubhouse to the whole world, and among other things, Justin will be helping lead that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TcOyQ"&gt;Uberti’s title will be head of streaming technology, a Clubhouse spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQeH17"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some news: after almost 15 years at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt;, today is my first day at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;! I'm impressed with what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pdavison?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@pdavison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rohanseth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@rohanseth&lt;/a&gt; have built, and I'm super excited to be joining the team and figuring out where this can go! &lt;a href="https://t.co/WcTSI8AAof"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WcTSI8AAof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Justin Uberti (@juberti) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juberti/status/1397612890601889792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ux6QyU"&gt;“I’m really optimistic about the potential [of Clubhouse]: everyone in the world knows how to use voice, it’s such an expressive medium (compared to text), and advancements like AirPods are making it easier to consume audio,” Uberti said at the end of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juberti/status/1397612898596261894"&gt;a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; discussing the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMj3Ms"&gt;WebRTC is an &lt;a href="https://webrtc.org/"&gt;open-source project&lt;/a&gt; that lets developers add real-time communication (RTC) features to applications, and it works on modern browsers and is supported within many native apps. The fact that Discord can instantly drop you into a voice chat in a browser? &lt;a href="https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc-ce01c3187429"&gt;WebRTC helps power that&lt;/a&gt;. And if you’ve used Clubhouse, you’ve probably experienced how easy it is to jump in and out of audio rooms on the fly — that’s also powered by WebRTC. (Uberti commended Clubhouse as a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juberti/status/1397612891663003650"&gt;“great example”&lt;/a&gt; of a novel RTC use-case.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q87MM8"&gt;As Clubhouse looks to compete with social audio products from bigger companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;Microsoft’s LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, hiring the creator of a key technology backing its app could give Clubhouse an advantage in an increasingly crowded field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRykdG"&gt;In addition to Stadia and Duo, Uberti also had a key role in the development of Google Hangouts Video and was the chief architect for AOL Instant Messenger, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juberti/"&gt;according to his LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big Oil and Gas had a no good, very bad day </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Environmental Group Takes Royal Dutch Shell Plc To Court Over Global Emissions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pTAne_C-zzDcA-NSY-w4AI72KyM=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347751/1233120319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Members of the environmental group MilieuDefensie celebrate the verdict of the Dutch environmental organisation’s case against Royal Dutch Shell Plc, outside the Palace of Justice courthouse in The Hague, Netherlands, on Wednesday, May 26, 2021. Shell was ordered by a Dutch court to slash its emissions harder and faster than planned, dealing a blow to the oil giant that could have far reaching consequences for the rest of the global fossil fuel industry | Peter Boer/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iqy7y2"&gt;Fossil fuel companies are having a big reckoning with climate change this week. Shareholders for Exxon and Chevron voted for measures that could force them to take more responsibility for their emissions, while a Dutch court is forcing Shell to slash its pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yk2tC4"&gt;Taken altogether, the actions reflect a growing push for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the energy sector to phase out&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fossil fuels. Major oil companies had already taken some steps to at least appear to address climate change, but activists are pushing for more action on a faster timeline to meet the scale of the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYfFZQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A growing push for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the energy sector to phase out&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fossil fuels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KcVAr2"&gt;Climate activist Bill McKibben called it a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billmckibben/status/1397602737106325506"&gt;watershed day&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that the ruling against Shell could be “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billmckibben/status/1397560462955499520"&gt;game-changing&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkKrgi"&gt;Exxon shareholders, during an annual meeting today, voted in at least two new board members who might force more climate-related change on the company. If they can sway others on the 12-member board of directors, they could direct Exxon to do business differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UVmnn"&gt;A small hedge fund called Engine No. 1, which has just a 0.02 percent stake in Exxon, nominated four “independent” candidates it says are capable of pushing the company in a more sustainable direction. Each new board member that’s voted in ousts a sitting member. One of the new board members is Kaisa Hietala, who previously helped lead oil refining company Neste’s venture into renewable energy products. Shareholders also voted in Gregory Goff, a former CEO for refinery company Andeavor. The other two seats were still too close to call after preliminary results came out this afternoon. This is the first time activist investors have successfully voted their picks onto Exxon’s board, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/26/business/economy-stock-market-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hg7IuM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the Company has failed to evolve in a rapidly changing world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZTkjM"&gt;“Over the past decade, the Company has failed to evolve in a rapidly changing world, resulting in significant underperformance to the detriment of shareholders and risking continued long-term value destruction,” Engine No. 1 said in a &lt;a href="https://sec.report/Document/0000902664-21-001931/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about why it put forward its slate of candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a76qaA"&gt;Exxon, the United States’ biggest fossil fuel producer, has been slower than its peers to pivot toward renewable energy sources. In December, it pledged to cut CO2 emissions by just 15-20 percent per barrel of oil and gas by 2025, and reduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422824/natural-gas-infrastructure-methane-emissions-climate-change-air-pollution"&gt;methane emissions&lt;/a&gt; (a greenhouse gas more potent than CO2) by 40-50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I952jp"&gt;Both Exxon and Chevron, the second-largest US oil producer, have set less ambitious environmental goals than peers in Europe. Chevron said in March that it wants to cut CO2 emissions from its operations by 35 percent per unit of production by 2028. Chevron’s shareholders &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./business/energy/chevron-shareholders-approve-proposal-cut-customer-emissions-2021-05-26/"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; a proposal today that forces deeper cuts. It calls on the company to specifically target emissions from the oil and gas it sells, which accounts for a majority of the emissions for which the company is responsible. Shareholders for ConocoPhillips passed a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./business/environment/conocophillips-shareholders-back-proposal-set-scope-3-targets-2021-05-11/"&gt;similar resolution&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t62pIu"&gt;Dutch company Shell went further than its American counterparts by recently announcing that it would get to net-zero emissions for both its operations and the products it sells by 2050 — a commitment to reduce, capture, and offset all of its pollution. But promises to reach milestones decades from now aren’t very helpful unless they’re backed up by a plan to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q0CTFl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People around the world are demanding climate justice”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ7m47"&gt;A landmark ruling from a Dutch court now pushes the company to act much faster. Instead of reducing emissions 20 percent by 2030, as the company had planned, the court ruled that Shell should slash emissions by 45 percent by 2030. Globally, emissions should drop roughly in half by the end of the decade in order to stave off more severe effects from climate change, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;United Nations climate scientists&lt;/a&gt;. Shell reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/dutch-court-rules-oil-giant-shell-must-cut-carbon-emissions-by-45percent-by-2030-in-landmark-case.html"&gt;plans to appeal&lt;/a&gt; the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZlea9"&gt;Environmental groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of The Earth, filed the suit against Shell in &lt;a href="https://www.ciel.org/news/historic-climate-case-against-shell-filed-in-the-netherlands/"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the company endangered Dutch citizens through its role in the climate crisis. “Shell cannot continue to violate human rights and put profit over people and the planet. This verdict is a clear signal to the fossil fuel industry. Coal, oil and gas need to stay in the ground. People around the world are demanding climate justice,” Andy Palmen, interim director of Greenpeace Netherlands, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/47934/historic-verdict-in-climate-case-against-shell/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3EayL"&gt;A mountain of &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; points to the need to keep global warming from surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a target enshrined in the Paris climate agreement. Investments in new fossil fuel projects need to stop immediately in order to hit that target, the International Energy Agency said in a big &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits-according-to-iea-special-report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; last week. The intergovernmental agency’s energy outlooks are often heeded by governments and energy companies, so its new advice on fossil fuels was widely seen as a sort of death knell for oil and gas growth. So while today might have been an unusually rough day for fossil fuel companies, there are probably more to come. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Boring Company tests its ‘Teslas in Tunnels’ system in Las Vegas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0K6Q0NZVSksI3xbFs1gh6uRKso=/0x2:2500x1669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347513/LVCC_Loop_Hero_1_April_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dnQRe6"&gt;Elon Musk’s Boring Company started shuttling passengers through the twin tunnels it built underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) this week, as part of a test to get the system ready for its full debut in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLPzAW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGMdhJuCw4c"&gt;Videos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPTr4DwFb3F/"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoringCompany/comments/nksr9n/the_las_vegas_convention_center_loop_is_minutes/"&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="https://teslaownersonline.com/threads/rode-vegas-loop-today.18103/"&gt;around the internet&lt;/a&gt; by the people who showed up for the test offer the most coherent glimpse yet at Musk’s solution for traversing the LVCC campus. It is quite literally just Teslas being driven through two 0.8-mile tunnels — a far cry from the autonomous sled-and-shuttle ideas that Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15476268/elon-musk-the-boring-company-car-tunnel-concept-video"&gt;once proposed for The Boring Company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOrLfJ"&gt;There are three stops to the “LVCC Loop” system. The stations at either end are above ground, while the one in the middle is at the same 30-foot depth as the tunnels. The Boring Company used a few dozen Tesla vehicles — including Model 3 sedans, and Model Y and Model X SUVs — during the test. While the company has talked about making riders call for cars using an app, the test only required them to walk up to the next available car. Test riders then hopped in, went to one of the other two stations, and repeated. It appears most riders got between seven or eight to a dozen rides during the test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lB8ays"&gt;Schlepping from one end of the LVCC campus is no quick feat on foot, especially after the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) recently added a whole new wing. Taxi lines and ride-hailing wait times are notoriously long, too. So any solution that makes it easier to get around the grounds will likely appeal to convention-goers, even if the amenity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257849/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-tunnel-finished-digging"&gt;cost the LVCVA $52.5 million&lt;/a&gt; ($48.6 million of which went to The Boring Company). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="labgik"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The full public debut is in just a few weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HIQfVI"&gt;The Boring Company says the Loop will ultimately turn a 45-minute walk into a two-minute ride, though it’s not down to that level of efficiency yet (hence the test). In one video, one of the test riders said they had to wait about three to five minutes for a few of the rides, though even with a top speed of around 40 miles per hour, trips between stations appear to have taken about a minute to a minute-and-a-half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruJ3qu"&gt;One of the things increasing that total travel time was the underground station. There were times when test riders pulled into the station only to run into some congestion. The drivers have to maneuver around other parked Teslas, people getting in and out, and cars queueing up to reenter the tunnels. It’s a tight fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFtQuQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We had a lot of fun getting to know the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boringcompany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@boringcompany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VegasLoop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VegasLoop&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LVCVA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LVCVA&lt;/a&gt; LVCC expansion. Here is a taste of the experience with a full video coming very soon on YouTube. Good times! &lt;a href="https://t.co/pb51MZjqYT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pb51MZjqYT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miles to Memories (@milestomemories) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milestomemories/status/1397272263771099139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3iDaSA"&gt;There was also just some general confusion as people got used to how the system worked. Passengers were being constantly reminded to leave the doors open when exiting the vehicle to speed up the transition to the next ride. One person got &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milestomemories/status/1397272263771099139"&gt;bonked on the head&lt;/a&gt; by one of the Model X’s Falcon Wing doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mt9SHS"&gt;The big question with The Boring Company’s efforts in Las Vegas is pretty much the same as it always is with Musk’s ideas: how will it scale? The company says it wants to eventually transport 4,400 people per hour through the LVCC Loop’s tunnels, though TechCrunch discovered &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised/"&gt;documents late last year that seem to show it will only be able to transport 1,200&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the LVCC Loop, The Boring Company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;wants to build a massive tunnel system that runs under the whole city&lt;/a&gt;, including the Las Vegas Strip and the airport. It claims this massively scaled-up version of its underground highway will be able to handle a little more than 50,000 passengers per hour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRUcPw"&gt;The Boring Company has claimed it plans to allow a max speed of 150 miles per hour in these tunnels but has limited speeds during the tests so far. And while the goal is to ultimately have the Teslas drive themselves, the system will rely on human drivers for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDaMEc"&gt;Reaching that top speed is one of the key things &lt;a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/loop"&gt;The Boring Company says sets its “Teslas in Tunnels” idea&lt;/a&gt; apart from, say, a subway system. (Another is cost, which we’ve seen the company tout in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269188/elon-musk-boring-company-miami-tunnel-mayor-francis-suarez"&gt;most recent proposal in Miami&lt;/a&gt;.) It likely won’t be attainable unless the company is able to automate the driving, as the tunnels are too tight for a human driver to continuously (and carefully) navigate at such high speeds — another thing that was obvious from videos of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ixcMU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Iran bans cryptocurrency mining for four months to stave off blackouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-Rfntc_gjHvn7WqejdOxZqiTRw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347462/mdoying_180308_2373_0092still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N7q6hv"&gt;Iran is temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/iran-bans-crypto-mining-to-keep-the-lights-on-over-summer?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;banning cryptocurrency mining&lt;/a&gt; after some of the country’s major cities experienced repeated blackouts. President Hassan Rouhani said that the ban would last until September 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63YQJj"&gt;The country &lt;a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/436178/Iran-electricity-issue-should-we-expect-blackouts-again"&gt;has experienced summer blackouts in years past&lt;/a&gt;, and while the current round of outages is mostly being blamed on a drought that’s affecting the country’s ability to generate hydroelectric power, it seems that the Iranian government is eager to cut down on any aggravating factors. Power-hungry cryptocurrency mining operations, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkwW8a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57260829"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Iran operates a program where Bitcoin miners must register with with the government, pay extra for electricity, and sell their coins to the central bank. President Rouhani stated that the legal mining operations in the country consume around 300MW a day; Iran’s state-owned grid operator, Tavanir, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/iran-bans-crypto-mining-to-keep-the-lights-on-over-summer"&gt;reportedly claimed&lt;/a&gt; a more conservative daily usage of 209MW. Either number is small compared to the 2,000MW &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/5/26/iran-bans-all-crypto-mining-after-summer-power-cuts-strike"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; is used by illegal miners, which reportedly make up 85 percent of the country’s operations. The deputy minister of electricity and energy &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/bitcoin-mining-craze-on-subsidized-power-pressures-iran-s-grids?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;even told one news organization&lt;/a&gt; that miners were using the free electricity afforded to mosques to run mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mb4Sk3"&gt;President Rouhani seemed to joke about how much mining was unlicensed in the country, saying that “everybody has a few miners laying around and are producing Bitcoins,” though he also said that the unlicensed miners were the reason for the ban, which will apply to all mining in the country. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57260829"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the licensed mining operations have already voluntarily shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yvaoom"&gt;While it could be argued that those who were already breaking the law may not be likely to stop because the government told them to, Iran has been cracking down on the unlicensed operations, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-21/iran-enlists-its-spies-to-hunt-down-power-hungry-bitcoin-miners?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;enlisting spies to track them down&lt;/a&gt;. Tavanir also provides rewards for reporting people who are mining illegally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDlX9A"&gt;Crypto observers outside Iran will likely want to keep an eye on the price of Bitcoin to see how (or if) it reacts to an estimated 3.4 to 4.5 percent of the network’s mining capability being thrown into jeopardy. Bitcoin has had a turbulent time recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332677/india-cryptocurrency-trading-mining-possession-ban-law-report"&gt;as India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/major-china-bitcoin-mining-hub-lays-out-harsher-crackdown-measures.html"&gt;parts of China&lt;/a&gt; look to ban it, and as Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;has stopped accepting&lt;/a&gt; the cryptocurrency, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;citing environmental concerns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Amy Klobuchar calls on Justice Department to probe Amazon-MGM deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Committee Considers Nominations For Judges" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJR0U2caILnIyaTElhtjvCcdlR0=/0x1:4637x3092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347325/1232578246.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YshABB"&gt;On Tuesday, Amazon announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;it had reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; to purchase the film and TV goliath MGM for $8.45 billion — and leading antitrust figures in Congress aren’t happy. In a letter today, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) sounded the alarm over the size and scope of the deal, calling on the Justice Department to investigate the acquisition before it finalizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tx3yIP"&gt;“This is a major acquisition that has the potential to impact millions of consumers,” the senator said in a statement Wednesday. “The Department of Justice must conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that this deal won’t risk harming competition.” Klobuchar chairs the committee tasked with overseeing competition in digital markets in the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyceXI"&gt;The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vI2eCR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a major acquisition that has the potential to impact millions of consumers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts59OK"&gt;MGM is behind some of the most popular Hollywood franchises, including the James Bond and Rocky libraries. The merger agreement signals that Amazon is getting serious about expanding its currently limited media empire. A majority of Amazon Prime subscribers, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-q1-2021-prime-video-viewers-1234963065/"&gt;over 175 million&lt;/a&gt; out of the 200 million plus people, have streamed content on the company’s Prime Video service. The merger would bring hundreds more films and TV shows to that library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMUNgg"&gt;The concern over Amazon’s new acquisition isn’t limited to Democrats. Republicans like Rep. Ken Buck (CO) and Sen. Josh Hawley (MO) said Amazon should not be permitted to purchase the media company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAe5ei"&gt;“This sale should not go through. Amazon is already a monopoly platform that owns e-commerce, shipping, groceries &amp;amp; the cloud. They shouldn’t be permitted to buy anything else. Period,” Hawley said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1397542482720735235?s=20"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqXoZA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1397609137652051973?s=20"&gt;Buck quote-tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Hawley’s tweet, agreeing with his statement. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday, a spokesperson for Buck confirmed that he believed the merger should not go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlRk7y"&gt;“Rep. Buck is extremely concerned by Amazon’s extensive monopoly power that continues to expand through acquisitions,” a spokesperson for Buck said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday. “He is also disappointed with the FTC’s lack of scrutiny and failure to adequately enforce antitrust laws over the past decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFZ2kv"&gt;Over the last few years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have engaged in sweeping investigations into Big Tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. Amazon has been a particular lightning rod for Republicans due to a long-running feud between founder Jeff Bezos and former president Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uc2rWk"&gt;On Tuesday, Amazon faced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453125/dc-attorney-general-amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-favored-nation"&gt;first major antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; posed by DC Attorney General Karl Racine. The lawsuit accuses the e-commerce giant of suppressing competition and placing strict conditions on third-party sellers and how they price their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxfaSi"&gt;“The DC Attorney General has it exactly backwards – sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement responding to the lawsuit Wednesday. “Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abIt84"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Of course repairing the new Apple TV remote is harder than simply unscrewing it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0kk6cG65R8KV4CoOps1KM2cWmg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347302/DSCF3948_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lMycCY"&gt;Apple, a company notorious for making its products difficult to repair, has given us a real head-scratcher of a repair situation with its next-generation streaming remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxu4M8"&gt;At issue here are a pair of screws that would appear to make repair semi-straightforward but absolutely do not. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-AmXttNmqA"&gt;iFixit tore down&lt;/a&gt; the second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt;, which will ship with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; streaming box, and found that these two screws on the outside of the remote do basically nothing. Do not, in other words, expect to be able to fix your new remote or its battery easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1xfRQ"&gt;First off, Apple’s new wand features a one-piece &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F26%2F22455294%2Fapple-tv-siri-remote-ifixit-teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aluminum outer casing&lt;/a&gt; design — meaning that while minimal and pretty, this thing was probably already going to prove difficult to tinker with. You might think, therefore, that a pair of tiny screws at the bottom of the remote near its charging port would offer easy access to the thing most likely to need to be repaired on this remote: the battery. You would be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflUJ0BqVtj70FwQYOsJ7UUuB2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529634/DSCF3938.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The previous generation of Siri Remote (left) shown next to the newer remote (right). The newer remote has two tiny screws at the bottom. They do nothing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZBXF0"&gt;Instead, iFixit’s video &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-AmXttNmqA"&gt;teardown indicated&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny plate that covers its Lightning port — another Siri Remote sin, if I’m being honest — effectively goes nowhere. To get inside the remote, iFixit needed to use a handful of specialized tools to pop off the buttons on the remote, remove more tiny screws and tiny component parts, wriggle the remote’s inner frame out of its aluminum shell, unscrew the logic board from the remote’s skeleton, and finally, pop out the 1.52Wh battery. Oh, and its cables are soldered together with those of the Lightning port, making DIY repairs all the more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AZ5q0"&gt;Is the lack of simple repairability on the next-generation Siri Remote entirely surprising? Well, no. Of course not. Repairing the first-generation Siri wand was similarly a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b14Tz1DWIX4"&gt;whole entire thing&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is also notorious for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/microsoft-and-apple-wage-war-on-gadget-right-to-repair-laws"&gt;lobbying against&lt;/a&gt; right-to-repair legislation, has been shown to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348240/apple-right-to-repair-legislation-antitrust-investigation-policy"&gt;internally conflicted&lt;/a&gt; about its own position on the matter, and has used &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/right-to-repair-is-less-complicated-and-more-important-1834672055"&gt;bad-faith arguments&lt;/a&gt; to shield itself from criticism about how difficult its products are to fix, particularly where it relates to proprietary component parts and repair instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEZug1"&gt;But for a remote with a rechargeable battery, Apple sure makes it difficult to actually get in there and access one of the things most likely to need replacement down the road. And tricking us with a pair of screws that do little for repairability doesn’t exactly curry favor on the repair front, either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>San Jose approves Google’s gigantic and controversial new downtown campus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1a2RD4u--nR_6rARLz1Xzn2N4I=/165x0:1872x1138/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69347227/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_9.00.46_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jGcsGf"&gt;After first proposing it in 2017, Google has received unanimous approval from the San Jose City Council to move forward with its &lt;a href="https://realestate.withgoogle.com/sanjose/"&gt;Downtown West development&lt;/a&gt; plan, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/google-cleared-to-build-multi-billion-dollar-megacampus-in-san-jose.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The company and city have reached an agreement to develop around 80 acres of land in downtown San Jose, California that will also serve as a mixed-use residential, retail, and open space for Google employees and the city’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roJhnj"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c38bcfdcc8fedd5ba4ecc1d/t/60a29a1210bcf63b5c1caec9/1621269033923/%28i%29+Ordinance+-+Downtown+West+Development+Agreement+-+051421.pdf"&gt;the proposed development agreement (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, Google will construct 7.3 million square feet of office space and 4,000 housing units, 1,000 of which are being explicitly set aside as affordable housing. Along with 50,000 square feet devoted to retail and cultural space, the company also plans to build hotel rooms and “short-term residences” for visiting corporate guests. Google detailed some of these plans as renders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508416/google-gigantic-san-jose-campus-downtown-west"&gt;in late 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but this is just a portion of its West Coast real estate expansion. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/03/18/google-launches-billion-dollar-california-property-investment-plan-for-2021/"&gt;futuristic new developments in Mountain View and Sunnyvale&lt;/a&gt; are already under construction, and a huge New York office space &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18144448/google-nyc-campus-hudson-square-location-cost-open-date"&gt;in Hudson Square&lt;/a&gt; is also underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NzQrPeIVeUN6ZCaxSu23ULhZczw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21947236/Screen_Shot_2020_10_08_at_4.10.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/TUvYaP4YT00?t=139" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lDVEOv"&gt;Construction on Downtown West could start as early as next year but could take anywhere from 10 to 30 years to be completed. The timing of the project’s approval is complicated by how the pandemic has influenced the company’s general thinking on work. CEO Sundar Pichai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; a new flexible work policy for post-pandemic life that expects 60 percent of Google employees to only spend three days in the office, with some 20 percent of the company’s staff to work fully remotely from home. It seems reasonable to wonder if a dramatic expansion of office space makes sense if Google plans to use less of it than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="To0gUK"&gt;There’s also the question of how much Google’s proposed affordable housing will actually help. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18683827/google-silicon-valley-housing-crisis-1-billion-investment-sf-bay-area"&gt;committed $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to solving the California housing problem it played a role in creating, but price always remains a concern. San Jose, like large swaths of California, is not exactly a cheap place to live. Last year, the city was rated &lt;a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2020/2/18/21142384/san-jose-hardest-home-market-realtor-inventory-2020"&gt;the hardest city in the US to buy a home&lt;/a&gt;, with a median home price of $1.1 million. The situation is equally bad for renters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z0UsM"&gt;In 2019, the &lt;a href="https://reports.nlihc.org/gap/2019/ca"&gt;National Low Income Housing Coalition&lt;/a&gt; (NLHIC) found that San Jose was also severely lacking in affordable housing. For the 57,375 renter households the NLIHC counted, there were also only 16,825 affordable and available rental homes. With those numbers in mind, Google’s addition of 1,000 affordable homes seems minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5ZoOG"&gt;Activists and San Jose residents staged protests &lt;a href="https://abc7news.com/google-san-jose-protest-land-sale/4835078/"&gt;at the very first Council meeting&lt;/a&gt; to discuss selling the land to Google in 2018. Their basic worry was that Google’s development could price out current tenants in the area. The San Jose Sharks hockey team also threatened to sue Google and the city of San Jose if it wasn’t guaranteed parking for the next-door SAP Arena. Google ultimately agreed to 2,850 parking spaces and offered the team final approval on other infrastructure changes, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/25/in-about-face-san-jose-sharks-settle-over-concerns-about-googles-downtown-development"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Jose Mercury News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MzTyc"&gt;Google has made &lt;a href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/planning-building-code-enforcement/planning-division/projects-of-high-interest/google-project"&gt;concessions and adjustments&lt;/a&gt; along the way to approval, and at least claims to want Downtown West to be a part of San Jose, rather than just some extension of its campus. How that ultimately shakes out will depend on how the development affects San Jose’s most vulnerable, rather than Google’s own workers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is holding an Xbox and Bethesda showcase on June 13th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S6nO3f"&gt;Microsoft’s big E3 event to showcase upcoming Xbox and Bethesda games will kick off on Sunday, June 13th at 1PM ET. It will be a 90-minute show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NxMId"&gt;“The show will be focused on games from Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda, and many game creators from our partners around the world,” Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox games marketing, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/05/26/join-us-for-the-xbox-and-bethesda-games-showcase/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6pFlt9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re thrilled to announce the Xbox &amp;amp; Bethesda Games Showcase will be Sunday, June 13. Tune-in details here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/DIsA6QQZzP"&gt;https://t.co/DIsA6QQZzP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxBethesda?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxBethesda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1397628674757652485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="onU3XU"&gt;Microsoft completed its huge acquisition of ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;, so this event will be the first opportunity to see what the two companies have been cooking up together. The acquisition doesn’t mean that all Bethesda games are now Xbox exclusives — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442372/deathloop-preview-arkane-studios-ps5"&gt;upcoming &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from Bethesda-owned Arkane Studios, is debuting on PS5 and PC — but Microsoft’s Phil Spencer has already said that “some new titles in the future” will only be coming to Xbox and the company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He6KfM"&gt;There are a lot of potential titles that could be on display during the June showcase. We could get our next look at &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; following its &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/craig-the-halo-infinite-brute"&gt;rough showing last July&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;subsequent delay to this year&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164440/halo-infinite-launch-date-fall-2021"&gt;It’s set to launch in the fall&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt; seems tantalizingly close to release, especially after a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeluwz3g64A"&gt;recent update video posted by developer Double Fine&lt;/a&gt;, so we might get some news about the long-in-the-works sequel. Microsoft announced upcoming new titles in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335535/fable-xbox-series-x-pc-windows-10-trailer-game-pass-rpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21332876/forza-motorsport-xbox-series-x-trailer-4k-60fps-ray-tracing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series last year, so we may hear more about those games and other titles revealed at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21331849/xbox-series-x-games-event-trailers-gameplay-announcements-microsoft"&gt;last summer’s Xbox showcase&lt;/a&gt;. And from Bethesda, fingers crossed we’ll finally learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447792/bethesda-starfield-new-series-announced-e3-2018"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226966/bethesda-indiana-jones-game-machinegames"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
