    <title>Corsair’s latest headset has improved comfort, but it backpedaled on sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Corsair HS80 RGB Wireless" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYSDDSRWBX767rtPCfHoVT1Q3P8=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746869/hs80rgbhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Corsair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYYQNi"&gt;Corsair impressed me last year with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525271/corsair-hs75-xb-wireless-review-pc-xbox-specs-features-price"&gt;$150 HS75 XB Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, an Xbox-exclusive wireless headset that looked and felt more like a high-end set of headphones than a gaming accessory. They also had great sound quality and an easy-to-learn button layout with the right amount of features. It wasn’t necessarily a flaw that they only worked with Xbox consoles, but no one likes to be excluded. The company has now released the HS80 RGB Wireless for the same $150 price &lt;em&gt;with &lt;/em&gt;PlayStation compatibility, but these aren’t quite the successor that I was expecting or hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQpi7W"&gt;This one works with the PS4, PS5, as well as PC with its USB-A wireless transmitter. Unlike most wireless headsets that use a dongle like this, I couldn’t get it to work with my Nintendo Switch dock. Corsair says you’ll unlock higher-fidelity audio (24-bit / 90KHz) when it’s plugged directly into your PC, but it didn’t sound drastically better to me. Noticeable, yes, but not so much that I’d consider it the sole feature worth buying these for. There aren’t any PlayStation-specific features that are unlocked with this headset that I noticed, but it’s nice to have another option that works without a fuss on PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYh4Tt"&gt;Platform compatibility aside, the HS80 RGB Wireless is a departure from the HS75 XB Wireless in a few welcome and unwelcome ways. This new model’s closed-back design looks great, and it certainly remedies the HS75 XB’s issue of letting too much sound in through its open-back ear cups. But listening while in wireless mode made me realize that I preferred the benefits that the old open-back design helped to deliver, like the warmer, more inviting, and life-like sound. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair HS80 RGB Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWk0UQEAvGTqk1HmWFaF2DkQ8WI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790060/hs80rgbwirelesscontrols.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Corsair&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are all of the buttons and dials on the HS80. I’m missing the dedicated chat / audio mixing dial that was on the HS75 XB.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s9vZRc"&gt;The HS80 doesn’t sound bad, it just doesn’t have the same immediate “oh, this sounds wonderful” effect that the HS75 XB Wireless provided, despite having 50mm neodymium drivers in common. Though, again, the HS80’s sound quality seemed just a little clearer and more defined — particularly with music — while plugged into my PC, as is advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZbiX0"&gt;The overall look riffs on Corsair’s Void lineup of headsets rather than the ovular ear cup design of the headset I’ve been comparing it to throughout this piece. The Void has generally had more of an aggressive look, but these look sophisticated. The build quality feels like a minor improvement over the HS75 XB with more aluminum touches in the mix, and I’m all for Corsair’s choice to use plush fabric ear pads over the leatherette used in the HS75 that got a little clammy at times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxY9Gf"&gt;One of my favorite improvements is the comfort, which received a boost by switching to a bungee-style headband that helps the headset feel light on your head. Velcro straps can be adjusted on each side of the headset underneath the headband, and it has no issues accommodating my large head. In my brief testing, the fold-up microphone made my voice sound better than I expected it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HvdHW"&gt;The HS80 RGB Wireless cans have a slew of customizable equalizer and RGB lighting settings in the iCue app for Windows 10, so unsurprisingly PC is the best platform on which to experience them. Whether you’re wired or using them wirelessly, clicking in the volume dial switches between the equalizers saved in the app on PC. But unfortunately, that very useful feature didn’t work while wirelessly connected to a console.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair HS80 RGB Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/97-g8j-sPfs2q9mecvCQG_CKP2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790063/hs80rgbwirelessmic.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Corsair&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bungee headband is a key area of improvement in the design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S63Zyv"&gt;Coming back to performance, I tested the HS80 RGB for a while on PS5 with &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII: Remake&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;, constantly switching between it and Sony’s $100 Pulse 3D headset. The headset was simple to connect and get running. Though, to my surprise, I enjoyed the sound profile of the Pulse 3D more in both games. On the other hand, I preferred the comfort of the HS80 RGB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1js6AX"&gt;Of course, sound quality partially comes down to taste. The sound in Sony’s headset is much more forward with its mids and highs, which puts an emphasis on its 3D audio tech. Corsair’s headset doesn’t try so hard to compete in that regard, which is fine, but overall it’s a far less exciting sound profile to listen to by comparison. I wasn’t anticipating that, given that the HS75 XB Wireless were such a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4J7dD"&gt;I think there are people out there who may find all they need in a headset like HS80 RGB Wireless, expensive as it is for such a simple offering. But if you loved the HS75 XB Wireless as much as I did, you may be a little disappointed with a few of the changes here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s first portable monitor looks like it was yanked off an XPS laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell portable monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KF5r3VRNpZrcB-3gaP3zD0LTgrk=/0x1:843x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746874/dellportablemonitor1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvOX4H"&gt;Dell has announced a 14-inch portable USB-C monitor that’s priced at $349.99 and will be released globally on August 31st. It has a 1080p LED-backlit IPS panel (60Hz refresh rate, 6ms response time) and you can use it as a secondary display for your USB-C laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM02qc"&gt;The monitor, which Dell refers to as the C1422H, has narrow bezels and a minimalist design that makes it look as if it came off an XPS laptop. It features a built-in stand that tilts between 10 and 90 degrees. The portable monitor weighs less than two pounds, and it can reach a peak brightness of 300 nits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXKEmn"&gt;There’s a USB-C port on each side of the base, both of which can receive and pass through power; they can also handle a video feed via DisplayPort 1.2 alt mode. You can get it working just by connecting the monitor to your laptop or other device with the included USB-C cable. The monitor will pull power from your laptop while the two are connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFXBoq"&gt;If you want to keep your device charged while it’s connected to the monitor, you can plug your device’s USB-C power adapter into the other USB-C port in the monitor base for passthrough charging. Though, it’s possible that this portable monitor won’t be able to passthrough the full amount of power your laptop needs to quickly recharge. Dell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the portable monitor will top out at 65W of passthrough power for systems that use a 90W or greater USB-C power supply. For 65W or greater chargers, the monitor will passthrough 45W to your system. Here’s the chart that Dell supplied:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wejlrcUrdMVVBWNbwjzmmZgHbDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792148/chargerdellportablemonitor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chart, provided by a Dell spokesperson, illustrates how much passthrough power the portable monitor can provide to your device (right panel) when connected to USB-C power adapters with varying wattages (left panel).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uTMbt7"&gt;A portable monitor is a new venture for Dell, so it’s surprising how high Dell has set the price for its debut model when there are several alternatives with similar specs that cost significantly less. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ZenScreen-Portable-Monitor-MB16ACV/dp/B081SGZX1X/r?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This larger 15.6-inch IPS portable monitor&lt;/a&gt; from Asus costs $200 at Amazon, while &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AOC-i1601fwux-Extremely-Portable-1920x1080/dp/B06Y8SSQG5/r?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a similar one from AOC&lt;/a&gt; costs just over $100. In fact, Dell’s model closely mirrors &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkVision-M14-1920x1080-Monitor/dp/B07YX5NKK2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s $246 14-inch portable display&lt;/a&gt;, which has an almost identical stand. Notably, Dell isn’t promising better color accuracy or other niceties like a faster refresh rate that would lead me to believe it’ll outperform any of the options above. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell portable monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eYSds755zIA7kzgi8HMnsB_zBWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790838/dellportablemonitor2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0ec8fq"&gt;On the other hand, this monitor comes with a protective sleeve as well as a “three-year advanced exchange” service, where Dell will ship you a new monitor next-day if you encounter a defect for the duration of its three-year limited warranty. In addition, the monitor has a good design and slim bezels on its side. It might not be a bad thing to find a portable monitor that fits the look you’re going for — whether you’re trying to match your laptop’s aesthetic or not. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Intel previews its Alder Lake chip, promises hybrid CPUs for desktops and laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ne-gykhLSYM1E3ocw-cCRf0_wS8=/172x0:1483x874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746856/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.32.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sB5Wie"&gt;Intel has spent much of 2021 announcing plans for its future: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;a new IDM 2.0 strategy&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;naming schemes for its process nodes&lt;/a&gt;, and new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;desktop GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. At Intel’s Architecture Day 2021, we finally got a preview of how some of those changes are coming together in new chips, starting with the upcoming Alder Lake lineup later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVi8wD"&gt;As the company has been teasing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/13/21365544/intel-tiger-lake-11th-gen-xe-graphics-gpu-preview-first-look-architecture-day-2020"&gt;last year’s Architecture Day&lt;/a&gt;, Alder Lake will feature Intel’s latest hybrid architecture: instead of simply offering the next generation of powerful Intel CPU cores, it’ll offer a mix of both performance and efficiency x86 cores, both of which Intel previewed as part of its announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15o7Rb"&gt;Additionally, Alder Lake will be the first chip released on Intel’s newly renamed Intel 7 technology node (not to be confused with Intel 4, which was previously known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo"&gt;Intel’s delayed 7nm node&lt;/a&gt;, and will be available to consumers sometime in 2023 under the codename “Meteor Lake”). Intel 7 still uses similar technology to the company’s current 10nm tech, instead of the bigger leap in manufacturing processes planned for Intel 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JeznoD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The summer Intel fell behind","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KwfVGuR26cT53z62_FeIGKuNLro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792159/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.25.40_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vZDbxZZKqugxVf4ZVwrCBv2igWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792158/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.25.50_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gWoCYM"&gt;The new x86 performance core — codenamed “Golden Cove” — is the successor to the Willow Cove cores that are currently found in the company’s 11th Gen Tiger Lake processors. Intel claims that it’s the most powerful CPU core its ever built, but the company only offered a comparison to its Cypress Cove cores (the version of its 10nm architecture that Intel ported to its 14nm process), not the more advanced Willow Cove cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2n0GD"&gt;Meanwhile, the company’s new x86 Efficient core (codenamed “Gracemont”) aims to be “the world’s most efficient x86 CPU core” while still offering higher IPC than the company’s Skylake chips. Intel claims that for single-thread cases, one of its new efficient cores hits 40 percent more performance at the same power (or similar performance while using 40 percent of the power) of a Skylake core, improvements that double when comparing four Efficient cores running four threads to two Skylake cores running four threads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O12SKk"&gt;Broadly speaking, the “performance” cores are the ones that have featured in Intel’s beefier Core-class processors, while the “efficiency” cores resemble the Atom-class processors in lower power devices. And each of those new architectures would be interesting on their own, but Intel plans to combine the two in a hybrid architecture as a core product to its lineup — starting with its upcoming Alder Lake chips this fall — that makes them far more notable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0UZdtLx_TKPBzC4Rzs3cHQuZlU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792157/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.16.31_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z4iRBn"&gt;Intel’s dipped its toes into offering hybrid architectures before, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21285821/intel-3d-stacked-lakefield-chips-hybrid-core-atom-arm-processor"&gt;Lakefield chips last year&lt;/a&gt;. Those models, though, only offered a single Sunny Cove performance core with four lower-power Tremont efficiency cores and were limited to only a handful of lower-powered devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;. Lakefield chips were also supposed to power more dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;Windows 10X devices like the Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, but Microsoft backed out of those plans in favor of Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H8xCpB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From 9W to 125W&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FYD0pm"&gt;The new Alder Lake chips, however, are aspiring to be far more ambitious. Intel teased a full range of chips from 9W to 125W that would utilize the new hybrid approach, combining multiple high-end performance cores with efficient cores for a wider range of power when users need it and efficiency when running less strenuous tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRSiM2"&gt;Given that Intel’s announcements today largely focused on the architectures, there are no hard product announcements, but the company did tease several planned Alder Lake SoCs that would utilize the new cores. Those include a desktop SoC with eight performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and integrated memory, graphics, and I/O; a laptop SoC with six performance cores, eight efficiency cores, imaging, Thunderbolt 4 support, memory, I/O, and more powerful Xe graphics all integrated in; and an ultramobile-focused SoC with two performance cores and eight efficiency cores. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYu9uArfC7ccOQ1Ik2Az1GUAgck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792156/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.16.23_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n7WLND"&gt;To make all that work together, Intel also showed off its new scheduling technology, Intel Thread Director, which is designed to better handle how activity is assigned to performance or efficiency cores depending on need. For example, Thread Director can automatically assign high-priority tasks to performance cores, while offsetting background threads to efficiency cores. Intel also says that it’s collaborating with Microsoft specifically to ensure that Thread Director is optimized for “the best performance on Windows 11.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZUim7"&gt;Intel, of course, isn’t the first company to use a combination of performance and efficiency cores for optimized computing; the concept has been a cornerstone of &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/big-little"&gt;Arm’s big.LITTLE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/dynamiq"&gt;DynamicIQ&lt;/a&gt; technologies for over a decade. It’s been a key part of the domination of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips for Android phones, Apple’s A-series chips in the iPhone, and — perhaps most relevant for comparison to Intel — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s M1 computer chips&lt;/a&gt; (which feature four high-performance “Firestorm” and four energy-efficient “Icestorm” cores). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ndSqW"&gt;We’ll have to wait for the first Alder Lake chips to arrive in the coming months to see how Intel’s latest attempt at cracking hybrid computing holds up. But it’s clear from Architecture Day 2021 that Intel views it as not just a niche for in-between devices but as a key part of its product lineup going forward. Now all that’s left to do is see if it can deliver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcZF4O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1lXNV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6GiXn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZ7MRj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Cs7EH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOw9vV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="6CE8n6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"&gt;Intel Arc&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s first big foray into dedicated gaming GPUs, coming in Q1 2022, but we got another preview at some of additional details for the upcoming graphics cards at the company’s Architecture Day 2021 event — including a first look at Intel’s AI-accelerated super sampling, now known as XeSS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3m6e0"&gt;XeSS looks set to take on Nvidia’s own Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) tech, will make its debut alongside the first Arc GPU architecture, known as Alchemist, in early 2022. Much like DLSS, it will upscale games from a lower resolution to provide smoother frame rates without a noticeable compromise in image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlTdfg"&gt;Intel is also using dedicated Xe-cores in its upcoming GPUs to power its XeSS technology, with dedicated Xe Matrix eXtensions (XMX) matrix engines inside to offer hardware-accelerated AI processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="o2e7aU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel enters the PC gaming GPU battle with Arc","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626912/intel-arc-gpu-brand-alchemist-codename-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="R5QIKQ"&gt;Similar to DLSS, XeSS works by using machine learning to rebuild detail from nearby pixels and previous frames, with Intel promising approximately two times performance improvements. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, takes a different track, using spatial upscaling techniques instead of the AI-based reconstruction methods used by Intel and Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXewHXP75tXEaBUeyt3kKUiZPLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792164/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.16.08_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xteJsv"&gt;Additionally, Intel promises that XeSS won’t just be limited to products with XMX. It plans to offer XeSS on a wide range of hardware in the future — including integrated graphics — with a version that supports the DP4a instruction set, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1rkVT"&gt;A brief demo showed off how XeSS looked in practice, showcasing a real-time demo rendered both in native 4K and at 1080p scaled to 4K using XeSS — but running at twice the frames per second thanks to the reduced demand. The demo (obviously) looked good, but it’s worth keeping in mind that Intel only showed off a controlled slice of a demo moving at a fairly slow clip. We’ll have to wait to see how XeSS actually fares in a fast-paced gaming environment, and how it looks next to other AI-based upscaling solutions like Nvidia’s DLSS technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ECPH2C"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Intel XeSS|103544" data-volume-uuid="7c29536e2" data-volume-id="103544" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-312" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew1NMn"&gt;Intel also confirmed that Alchemist will offer full support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, along with  hardware-based ray tracing with support for both DirectX Raytracing (DXR) and Vulkan Ray Tracing. Additionally, the company also announced that Unreal Engine 5 is already working on its Alchemist SoCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlP1HF"&gt;Intel also announced that it won’t actually be manufacturing its Alchemist SoCs on its own. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;As part of its IDM 2.0 strategy&lt;/a&gt;, Intel will actually be outsourcing the manufacturing of its Arc products to TSMC, with Alchemist in particular being built on the company’s N6 node. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkfJLW"&gt;Lastly, the company reiterated its long-term roadmap for its Arc GPUs: Battlemage (a second-gen Xe-HPG architecture), Celestial (third gen), and Druid (described as featuring “Xe Next Architecture). No release windows for the future products were given, but it’s clear that Intel isn’t just viewing its GPU strategy as a one-time experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM and AT&amp;T are teaming up to bring 5G to Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC cars by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WkzfhWvzwOugACCEJ7PzffaU8l8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746864/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1GbrA"&gt;General Motors and AT&amp;amp;T are partnering to bring 5G connectivity to “millions” of vehicles over the next decade. The improved connectivity will mean better software performance, enhanced navigation, and faster music and video streaming capabilities, company officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Z8AfB"&gt;Starting with model year 2024, all Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC vehicles will come equipped with 5G. In addition, all of GM’s current model year 2019 and newer vehicles, which are equipped with 4G LTE, will experience “faster connectivity speeds and many of the same performance benefits of future 5G-equipped vehicles” thanks to GM’s fifth-generation cellular network architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vp45w4"&gt;In other words, cars made in 2019 and beyond will have improved data speeds and software performance, as well as reduced transmission latency, thanks to this new effort by GM and AT&amp;amp;T. But that will depend on when AT&amp;amp;T’s network is ready to take on millions of new customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OCyEdF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;5G has the potential to be 100 times faster than 4G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pdVYLB"&gt;5G, so named because it is the fifth generation of cellular technology, has the potential to be 100 times faster than 4G LTE, according to Ericsson, but for many smartphone owners, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;it’s been a mixed bag&lt;/a&gt;. The infrastructure is taking longer to build than originally expected, and most smartphones that claim to use 5G aren’t any faster than 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmTFcw"&gt;That’s why GM and AT&amp;amp;T are waiting until 2024 before rolling out the new 5G-equipped vehicles. “It’s really not a function of what’s missing in the vehicles,” said Thomas DeMaria, executive director of 5G connectivity at GM. “It’s more around the maturity of the 5G tech technology, and also the readiness of 5G.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TkSswj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G: everything you need to know","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9sR1Zo"&gt;In the interim, GM’s 4G LTE-equipped vehicles starting with model year 2019 and newer will migrate to run over AT&amp;amp;T’s new 5G core infrastructure. According to the automaker, that will align with the timing of GM’s rollout of 5G, which will start with model year 2024. “As the new network infrastructure is built out over the next several years, we will test and learn to see if these improvements can be realized sooner,” a GM spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDtu3y"&gt;In addition to better data speeds, customers can also expect better security when using their cars to make phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmT8Ci"&gt;“What 5G enables versus 4G LTE, number one it’s complying with the overall 5G standards, which are much higher than 4G LTE,” Gregory Wieboldt, AT&amp;amp;T’s senior VP for global business and industry solutions, said in a call with reporters. “And it’ll offer more privacy for the identity and stronger encryption for your call and your data, because it’s run on a smarter network software platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL4Ntb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568437/halo-driverless-car-tmobile-5g-las-vegas"&gt;Self-driving cars are often held up as the ultimate application of 5G&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the low latency of 5G can help deliver safety information to an autonomous vehicle’s AI “brain” before it is even visible to a human driver. But in the US, at least, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;our networks just haven’t met the bar yet&lt;/a&gt; to make it a reality. GM and AT&amp;amp;T downplayed the significance of their rollout of 5G for autonomous vehicles at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJNS8v"&gt;“The network in the vehicle systems are increasingly relying on what I would call data augmentation,” DeMaria said. “So autonomous functions, ADAS [advanced driver assist systems] functions and other connected services, including navigation systems, increasingly are relying on supplemental data coming in from the network. So we’re going to continue to see that trend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbtpZJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Binance is facing an unconventional new legal claim over May 19th outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RoESAb73R3lHvhw96OaHPjV58KQ=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746821/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOgyRn"&gt;A group of disgruntled investors is pursuing a formal claim against the cryptocurrency platform Binance for allegedly causing millions in damages through an unanticipated outage earlier this year. Filed in an international business arbitration court, the case represents the largest investor action ever brought against a cryptocurrency platform, and a major test of the rights of investors speculating in digital currency markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sWawv"&gt;The case stems from &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/19/coinbase-binance-outage-crypto-bitcoin-crash/"&gt;a widespread service outage on May 19th&lt;/a&gt;, which coincided with a massive drop in the price of Bitcoin. Binance wasn’t the only platform affected, as a mass selloff clogged blockchain transactions and overwhelmed reserves, but the complex financial products offered by the platform made the damage particularly severe. By the time service had been restored, many futures and leverage traders on Binance had seen their entire accounts automatically emptied. The traders say that, if Binance had been capable of filling orders, they could have sold off before their holdings became worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmEQHY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binance does not have a listed headquarters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CcmlW3"&gt;More than 700 people were affected by the freeze, and early participants in the new action include losses as large as $12 million. If the action is successful, Binance will have to make up those losses out of its own pocket, and accept a higher level of liability to investor claims going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGLgxR"&gt;One participant in the new action, a Canadian investor named Fawaz, says he attempted to close his position as early as noon on May 19th — but the platform failure made it impossible. “I tried to click that Close Position button more than 70 times,” Fawaz said in a statement provided to reporters. “But it never worked. Eventually, my position got fully liquidated.” All told, he believes he lost $6 million because of the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8c1TM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In no jurisdiction would this ever be allowed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kykekd"&gt;Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9sIdg"&gt;Simply finding a venue to hear the case was a challenge. Binance does not have a listed headquarters that could place it in a specific jurisdiction, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573812/binance-crash-cryptocurrency-regulation-lawsuit"&gt;frustrated earlier attempts to file a traditional lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the company’s terms of service request that all legal proceedings be handled through the &lt;a href="https://www.hkiac.org/"&gt;Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre&lt;/a&gt;, a quasi-judicial body typically used to resolve transnational business disputes. The plaintiffs are hoping to bundle everyone affected by Binance outages into a single arbitration suit, minimizing court costs and giving investors like Fawaz their first shot at getting some of their money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qme4KN"&gt;“In no jurisdiction would this ever be allowed,” says David Kay, who is financing the action through his Liti Capital fund. “But they’re not subject to any jurisdiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FNcHw"&gt;Kay and his partners have already assembled a steering committee, led by a handful of plaintiffs affected by the outage including Fawaz. But they’re hoping to attract more before taking the claim to Hong Kong, and encouraging anyone affected by a Binance outage to join the case &lt;a href="https://liticapital.com/binanceclaim/"&gt;through their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2Ya2E"&gt;Most notorious for &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/womens-rights/womens-rights-workplace/its-time-end-forced-arbitration"&gt;their role in US employment law&lt;/a&gt;, arbitration hearings differ from traditional trials in important ways. The investors’ action is not technically a lawsuit, and the concept of a “class action” is not applicable. Without a national body of law, arbitrators rely on international standards for business practice. Without a government upholding the system, the parties expected to bear significant costs for initiating proceedings, although the specifics of the costs can vary. But similar to conventional courts, the final ruling is binding, and the Hong Kong Arbitration Centre has significant powers to enforce payment if the investors’ claim is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pk2oSC"&gt;Founded in 2017, Binance has been wildly successful as a cryptocurrency platform, growing into the primary venue for more complex financial trading in cryptocurrency markets. The platform claims to process &lt;a href="https://www.binance.com/en/about"&gt;more than a million trades each second&lt;/a&gt;, generating billions of dollars in user fees. That success has come with significant regulatory issues. The platform is currently under investigation from &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/doj-irs-investigating-crypto-exchange-binance-report"&gt;both the US Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt;, and has been &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/binance-uk-crackdown-boosts-rival-cryptocurrency-exchanges.html"&gt;formally blocked from operating in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJWOl9"&gt;The recent action is unconventional in a number of ways, not least in how the plaintiffs are organizing their case. The case is being financed by Kay’s Liti Capital, which will assume the significant upfront costs for mounting the lawsuit. In exchange, the firm will receive a portion of any resulting settlement, similar to the contingency rate offered by plaintiff’s lawyers in the US. In a crypto-oriented twist, Liti is itself &lt;a href="https://liticapital.com/about-us/"&gt;funded through a tokenized blockchain system&lt;/a&gt;, allowing more flexibility as investors seek to finance specific legal claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="le0yDQ"&gt;There’s a certain irony to using a blockchain-traded litigation firm to mount a lawsuit against a major cryptocurrency platform, but as Kay sees it, it’s all for the greater good of the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DETdoD"&gt;“I want Binance to be successful,” says Kay. “I want the crypto industry to be successful. But we have to set some basic rules.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 review: flipping into the mainstream</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Third time is maybe the charm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="CaJyux"&gt;The story of folding phones thus far has been one of compromise. Choosing a folding phone over a standard slab design has generally meant you compromised on performance, durability, and most of all, price. They’ve been the domain of early adopters, the people willing to put up with those compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JkBO"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the first folding phone to challenge all that. It has the same processor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen runs at a smooth 120Hz, just like Samsung’s other flagships. It has a new, allegedly more durable construction, plus IP water resistance, just like you’d expect on a modern phone. And most importantly, its starting price is $1,000, $450 less than the launch price of the Z Flip 5G it replaces. That puts the Flip 3 on the same price level as many high-end, non-folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpD4D5"&gt;The Flip 3 isn’t necessarily a sure bet, though. There are things it’s not as good at as other, standard phones. Using a folding phone like this is a different experience than many of us are used to. But increasingly, those differences boil down to personal preferences and choices, not compromises. And that means this is the first folding phone that can appeal to mainstream phone buyers, not just early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O4Rqre"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10708004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OREo3N"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AAOtj_R1-bXv-TGUBnmLE_Gtu5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790768/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s design is very similar to the earlier versions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nLiS6W"&gt;The design of the Flip 3 is largely the same as the first Galaxy Flip and the Flip 5G that both came out last year. The goal of this folding phone is not to turn a normal-sized phone into a tablet, like the Galaxy Fold series, but go the opposite direction: turn a large phone into something that fits easier in your pocket or purse. When closed, the Flip 3 is roughly the size of my wallet, but open it up and you’ve got a spacious, though tall, 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJePdD"&gt;Also like the earlier Flips, the Flip 3 is rather thick when it’s closed — it’s effectively twice the thickness of normal phones. But that didn’t make it hard to handle or slide into my pocket. Since the Flip 3 is only half as tall as other phones, there’s no concern of it poking out the top of my pants pocket. If anything, it stayed in my pants and jacket pockets &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than tall, thin phones — I never was concerned about it sliding out when I sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6O9Kq"&gt;The Flip 3’s hinge is mostly unchanged from last time — it’s still quite stiff and difficult to flick open with one hand, though satisfying to snap shut. (Samsung recommends using two hands to open the phone.) It can be positioned halfway open and stay there, so you can prop the phone up and take selfies, make a video call, or watch a video using only half the display. I never did this and don’t suspect many people outside of Samsung’s marketing materials would either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZUkZvRj8QPuTjkjFi5r289Ly1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790758/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hinge design is largely unchanged, but Samsung is using a new lubricant and aluminum alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvA0HvTSiaY1G8slJ2HGNcr8mfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790756/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3 is about as thick as two phones when closed and yes, there’s still a slight gap when it’s closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGbP2M"&gt;Most of the durability improvements Samsung made are under the hood, including self-curing gaskets to keep out water. You can read about those changes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;more detail in my colleague Dieter Bohn’s piece&lt;/a&gt;, but the takeaway is this: you don’t have to worry about getting the Flip 3 wet, which is quite an accomplishment for a delicate piece of electronics that literally folds in half. You do still have to be conscious of dust and debris — the Flip 3 has no official dust protection rating — and there’s still a visible gap in the hinge when it’s closed. TL;DR: the Flip 3 is good for the pool, not for the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfnZ5V"&gt;Otherwise, the fit and finish of the Flip 3 is on par with other flagship phones. The cream-colored review unit I have has a unique retro appeal, and its aluminum side rails and hinge have a soft, matte finish to them. (Samsung’s also providing a variety of other color options if cream isn’t your thing.) It doesn’t creak or grind disconcertingly when you open or close it, and the seams and tolerances are nice and tight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EC-gGx42ewCVd9PT6Voq6ODfxNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790754/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s cover screen is four times larger than before, but it’s still too small to do most things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wannr1"&gt;The big, visible change Samsung made with the Flip 3 is increasing the size of the cover screen from a scant 1.1 inches out to 1.9 inches (measured diagonally), which translates to a roughly four times larger display. It’s much more useful for checking notifications and controlling media than the miniscule ticker screen on the prior Flips, but it’s still quite limited. Though the interface mimics a smartwatch, including swipeable panels for calendar appointments, weather, alarms, and timers, you can’t reply to an incoming message without using Bixby voice commands (no thanks) or opening up the phone fully. You can use the screen to frame up selfies, and the clock is customizable with different animations, but the cover screen itself could stand to be quite a bit larger still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDfqOe"&gt;The cover screen’s limitations highlight how using the Flip 3 is different from a standard smartphone. You can’t just pick the Flip up and quickly do what you want one-handed — you almost always have to open the phone up, which often requires two hands. It’s less convenient than a standard phone and takes longer to do simple tasks because of this. I got around these limitations by just leaving the Flip open and treating it like a normal phone when I’m sitting at my desk or just hanging around the house, only bothering to close it when I wanted to put it in my pocket. But that largely defeats the reason you’d buy a folding phone in this style to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYU8hW"&gt;Samsung has a suite of colorful and fun cases for the Flip 3 that include built-in finger straps or rings to make it easier to hold the phone when it’s open. I got to try one of the strappy models and while the neon colors looked great and it was like having a built-in PopSocket on the phone, it doesn’t make it any easier to get the Flip 3 open with one hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uZpEft"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Uzk3pFkgD3Bs-_Ipt1hYZj9kws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790770/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3’s display has all of the specs for a top-tier phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YErFFb"&gt;Once the Flip 3 is open, you’re treated to a 6.7-inch, 1080 pixel wide OLED display that gets brighter and has a faster refresh rate than the prior models. It looks and feels just as nice as Samsung’s other OLED screens, with fast touch response, punchy colors, deep blacks, and smooth scrolling. It’s easy to see outdoors, looks great when watching video, and is right up there in performance and quality compared to other flagship phones. The Flip 3’s 9:22 aspect ratio is taller than most phones, but other than that, it works just like any other modern smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmUONa"&gt;On top of that upgraded display is a new factory-installed screen protector that’s made from a harder material than what Samsung used in the past. It’s much more difficult to dent or scratch than the old Flip’s gummy-feeling screen protector, and it feels much nicer to tap and swipe on. It’s basically indistinguishable in feel from the screen protectors many people put on top of normal phones and Samsung says it should last longer and bubble less than the old one. (In my week or so of testing I haven’t seen any bubbles form.) The company still does not recommend you remove the screen protector and if you need to get it replaced, it expects you to go to a certified repair center to have a new one installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5IPY3HprDoL0NxlX7g8SH1jY5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790740/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you look for the crease, you will see it, but it’s not a problem in normal use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o0fGda"&gt;You can still feel the crease in the center of the screen and if you look at the phone from an oblique angle, you can absolutely see it. But it never got in the way of actually using the phone and after a day or two, I just forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YJhqG"&gt;Despite Samsung’s claims of improved durability with last year’s Flip phones, a disconcertingly large number of them still &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgAKSnMH0s"&gt;cracked right at the crease&lt;/a&gt;, even if they weren’t dropped or damaged. Samsung is putting a lot of weight on how it rearranged the screen’s layers to make them more durable this time around and claims the new screen protector makes the screen 80 percent stronger than before. The company is also giving away a year of its $12.99 per month extended warranty to those who preorder the Flip 3, which lets you get the screen fixed for a $249 fee. But I can understand why you might want to wait a few months and see how things shake out with the Flip 3’s screen durability before taking the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xaH9V2"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ULyMLN"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as the Galaxy S21, and its performance is as quick and snappy as any other flagship phone released this year. It’s also fully compatible with all of the 5G flavors available in the US, including the still-rare-but-fast-if-you-can-find-it millimeter wave networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Ff263"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Performance and battery life are right in line with what you’d expect from a flagship phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mA4tpB"&gt;Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screentime between charges. That’s enough to last me a full day without concern and the wireless charging makes it easy to top up the battery on my nightstand or when I’m at my desk. You can get phones that last longer between charges, but most people won’t have a problem with the Flip 3’s stamina. One note: the Flip 3, like many other high-end phones released in the past couple of years, does not come with a charging brick in the box. It supports up to 25W fast charging, but you’ll have to BYOB (bring your own brick).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyLBeM"&gt;New for the Flip 3 is a set of stereo speakers, a noticeable upgrade over the mono speaker on the older Flips. The new speakers are much louder and make watching video more enjoyable, though I noticed the earpiece speaker was noticeably louder than the bottom speaker when I watched YouTube, as if the stereo balance was shifted. That could be because the speaker is facing directly at me, while the bottom speaker fires off to the side, but Samsung wasn’t able to immediately explain it when I asked. Still not available is a headphone jack, so you’d better like those speakers or use Bluetooth headphones with the Flip 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdjPP8"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rnZ1xtoE1DTQTp5_g40ehw9JnEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790746/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s cameras have the same specs as last year’s models and don’t quite hang with the best camera phones available now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dQZiHa"&gt;Perhaps the area where Samsung made the least forward progress is with the Flip 3’s camera array. The 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras and the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera have the same specs and lenses as last year’s Flip 5G. It’s an area where you are required to make different choices about your priorities compared to standard flagship phones that have more capable or versatile camera systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qtlAP"&gt;That isn’t to say the Flip 3’s cameras are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, it’s just that if camera quality or features are the primary concerns for you in a phone, it’s not the best one to choose. Pictures from any of the cameras are characteristically Samsung, with vibrant, almost oversaturated colors, lots of sharpening, and noticeable smoothing of faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qUaBjd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10708526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJeV99"&gt;The results are images that many people will find pleasing and want to share right away, without making many edits or adjustments or zooming in to compare fine details. The Flip 3 is not as good in low light as an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Pixel 5, nor does it have the versatility of the Samsung S21 Ultra’s long telephoto lens. But for everyday snaps and casual picture taking, the Flip 3 is plenty capable. Plus, you can use the cover screen to frame selfies with the main cameras, though it’s still too small for me to do that comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BIgrdQ"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 software and other stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VJk7Y2"&gt;The rest of the Flip 3’s story is typical Samsung. It’s running Android 11 with Samsung’s OneUI interface on top of it. It’s fine, if a bit cluttered, and Samsung is still using its stock apps as places to jam unwanted ads, which is gross and annoying. (At least, at launch there will be ads. Samsung says it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630332/samsung-ads-default-stock-apps-weather-pay-theme-confirmed"&gt;removing them later this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fvxLle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Once it’s open, the Z Flip 3 is just like any other Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GjPvwR"&gt;Unlike the Fold line of phones, the Flip 3 isn’t trying to replace a tablet or come up with any new multitasking paradigms, and it doesn’t have any issue displaying popular apps like Instagram. Once it’s open, it basically just works like any other Samsung phone, complete with Samsung’s app store, browser, mobile payments, notes app, health app, and more. Samsung has committed to delivering four years of security updates and three generations of new Android platform updates on its phones, which means your folding phone’s software support might last longer than its screen does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JWwT28"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aN3p0a_7xpmXNtuAlmyXHaAtK28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790742/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s entire appeal is being a big phone that fits easily in a pocket or purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuzRNb"&gt;The original Galaxy Z Flip showed that a folding phone can feel like a normal phone, once you get over its wow factor. It can be the kind of thing that you just get used to day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ds6N79"&gt;The Z Flip 3 is Samsung applying its relentless iteration to that idea and making it something that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a normal phone, right down to the price it charges for it. Samsung has systematically checked off the boxes that made earlier Flip models purely curiosities: performance, features, price, and durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6kR0R9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Z Flip 3 is the first foldable that’s also a normal phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0SoR"&gt;I don’t think the Flip 3 is for everyone — there are still people out there who want the absolute best camera or aren’t intrigued by the idea of what the Flip offers. And how well its improved durability holds up over the long term is still an open question. But it’s the first folding phone where I can see a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people choosing it, particularly when it’s the same cost as a phone that looks the same as what they’ve been using for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oCGGRt"&gt;Just a few years ago, it seemed like folding phones were just a futuristic experiment. With the Z Flip 3, the second phase of the experiment begins, the one where we find out if folding phones can appeal to more than just early adopters. It’s an important proving ground for the concept and fortunately the Z Flip 3 appears up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s purring cats might be my favorite PS5 feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5xGyKpFTNDhRxtsSeD4RiFLlxY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746621/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20210818135640.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1g0Jn2"&gt;Since the PlayStation 5 debuted, we’ve seen lots of novel uses of its DualSense controller. Game developers have utilized the haptic vibrations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;to simulate weather like falling rain or blowing wind&lt;/a&gt;, while the added resistance in the triggers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;makes firing a weapon or making an exhausted NBA star sprint all the more immersive&lt;/a&gt;. Often these features help make seemingly small interactions feel more notable — and my favorite new example is the cats in &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFu6D"&gt;The new version isn’t really a director’s cut, at least in the typical sense, but rather an enhanced version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai"&gt;the open-world samurai game&lt;/a&gt; that originally launched as the last big PS4 exclusive in 2020. That game married a fairly standard open-world structure with unique samurai elements, like involved sword fighting and the ability to soak in a hot spring or find a quiet spot to write a haiku. The director’s cut, meanwhile, is both a next-gen update and an expansion of that original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wv97nV"&gt;In terms of the expansion, there’s a whole new region, called Iki island, that features its own storyline that’s pretty distinct from the main campaign. Protagonist Jin Sakai learns of a sort of hallucinogenic poison being used on Tsushima and tracks its source down to a cult-like group, led by a woman known simply as Eagle, on Iki. In order to protect his homeland he sets out to the island to stop Eagle altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uH4yOc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sc4_dXjkCl8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TNQJF2"&gt;Iki is much smaller than Tsushima, and the expansion also has a much darker tone than the base game. Things start out rough: Jin’s boat encounters some bad weather, and he washes up on shore completely alone. Eventually he joins forces with a group of raiders who have been ravaged by Eagle’s forces. There’s lots of death and drama, and the challenge has also been ramped up a bit — I keep finding myself dying a lot more than usual (though that may have to do with the long layoff between now and having played the original version last year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tBCyc1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ghost of Tsushima is a beautiful samurai tale buried under a familiar open-world game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9z41B9"&gt;Outside of the new location and quest line, as well as the standard next-gen upgrades like improved visuals and performance (you can, as with most PS5 games, choose between “higher resolution” and “better frame rate”), there are also a handful of new gameplay features. Shaman enemies are able to strengthen other fighters, adding a nice layer of strategy to combat, and you can also unlock additional exploration skills for finding specific locations. It’s here that the most important addition comes into play: animal sanctuaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEPk3A"&gt;Iki island feels much more alive than Tsushima, with a greater variety of wildlife. When I first arrived, there were monkeys hanging out on the beach, and as I moved deeper into the island, I discovered new locations where cats just kind of hang around, lazing in the grass. The first time you find a sanctuary you have to earn those cats’ trust by playing the flute, which you do by moving the controller up and down, utilizing the DualSense’s motion-sensing feature to keep in tune. Once that’s sorted, you can walk up to any cat and press the right trigger to pet them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-T7VU7WRbbmcNsFlfhqIebKuP3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790846/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20210818140042.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PN0Stx"&gt;What follows is an adorable animation where a cat slowly walks up to Jin, sniffs, nuzzles his hand, and then gives him a playful bite on the wrist. The whole while, the DualSense does a remarkable job of replicating the unmistakable feel of a purr through the controller’s vibrations. (It’s also a great place to play around with the game’s photo mode, where you can really zoom in to see the details; when it’s windy, you can even see the cat’s fur blowing around.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHAxoV"&gt;Part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt; so distinct is the way it balances brutal, bloody combat with quieter, more reflective moments. These new sanctuaries lean into this idea even more. They’re not exactly vital, and you could probably experience the new storyline without even interacting with them. But, a few hours in, they’ve been the most memorable part of the expansion for me so far — there are few better ways to unwind after a violent conflict than with a cat purring in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojE86O"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches August 20th on the PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil’s upcoming Wear OS smartwatch leaks with Snapdragon 4100 Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VC0jv4LrCJPoRtwaAburEShrUf8=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746604/ezgif_6_c24c8ad20bec.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fossil’s Gen 6 smartwatch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qXHst6"&gt;Fossil’s upcoming Gen 6 smartwatch has leaked thanks to a retailer listing &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, it appears to be Fossil’s first smartwatch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, which launched last year but has so far only appeared on a handful of devices. The new watch follows Fossil’s Gen 5 lineup, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;dates back to 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223834/fossil-gen-5-lte-smartwatch-announcement-skagen-michael-kors"&gt;new LTE-equipped models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiG2Ij"&gt;The Gen 6 will be Fossil’s first Wear OS smartwatch since Google announced it was collaborating with Samsung on the third-generation of its operating system. But based on currently available information, the wearable is unlikely to launch with the new software. When Google announced its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/118166873/what-wear-os-3-means-for-you?hl=en-GB"&gt;Wear OS 3 update plans in July&lt;/a&gt; it said that Fossil’s upcoming devices will be among those to receive a Wear OS 3 update in the “mid to second half of 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ROmiplaRt6fxz1nZZwFEFNvyaq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792097/Fossil_Gen_6_leak_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right there appear to be two buttons and a rotating crown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AR7vQi"&gt;In terms of specs, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports that the Gen 6 smartwatch comes with a 1.28-inch 416x416 circular OLED display, and should be available in 42mm and 44mm case sizes with a variety of straps including leather, fabric, and metal versions. The leak suggests there’s 8GB of internal storage, 24 hours of battery life, GPS, and heart rate, blood oxygen, and fitness tracking features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9J3pF"&gt;Fossil’s Gen 6 smartwatch appears to be going on sale on September 27th, when it looks set to cost €299 (around $350) or €329 (around $385), according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySfjQB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook is bringing the office to VR with Horizon Workrooms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XoPD9c"&gt;It wasn’t long into a recent press briefing I attended in virtual reality when Mark Zuckerberg showed up to talk about the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaltvD"&gt;I was sitting at a long, U-shaped conference table with a handful of other reporters, our floating torsos bobbing over our chairs, as the Facebook CEO beamed in. A giant, floating display nearby showed other Facebook employees dialed in from the non-VR world to watch us through their computer screens. It was there that Zuckerberg first appeared through his webcam before donning a headset and teleporting into a chair at the table as his own legless avatar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JDji4"&gt;We were there to preview a new app, which Facebook is describing as an “open beta,” for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt; called Horizon Workrooms. It’s the social network’s first stab at creating a VR experience specifically for people to work together in. After spending over an hour in Workrooms, I can see its potential as a more immersive way to communicate with people who are physically apart, but I don’t see it catching on beyond the most diehard VR enthusiasts anytime soon. That said, I can see this experience become compelling for more casual users, and potentially those who are totally new to VR, in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mG7ik4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10708748"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWKeRq"&gt;While an incremental update to Facebook’s VR efforts in its own right, Workrooms fits into the social network’s broader ambitions to own the next computing platform and build the so-called metaverse. Zuckerberg went so far as to recently say he wants Facebook to be primarily thought of as a metaverse company—a sci-fi concept that says we will all one day spend significant chunks of time in a fully immersive, digital space. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Or as Zuckerberg puts it, an “embodied internet.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BHsoS"&gt;What impressed me the most about Workrooms is the way that it brings parts of the outside world into VR. Up to 16 people in VR can be in a Workroom together, while an additional 34 people can join over video call without wearing a headset. A companion desktop app lets you beam a live feed of your computer screen over your virtual table space. Thanks to the Quest’s hand-tracking and front-facing cameras, a virtual representation of your physical keyboard sits underneath your screen for typing into a barebones web app Facebook built for note taking and managing calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GAAzCh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it might be the most intense VR application that exists”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="T6Oh09"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Horizon: Boz|103541" data-volume-uuid="8ecab1579" data-volume-id="103541" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-96" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Facebook Reality Labs VP&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kcY2Ks"&gt;“I think it might be the most intense VR application that exists, in terms of how much we’re trying to put every bell and whistle from the headset into the experience you’re using,” Facebook’s top AR/VR executive, Andrew Bosworth, told us during the briefing, which was the first of its kind I’ve experienced entirely in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VphqRk"&gt;For now, the process of getting into Workrooms initially is quite clunky. It oddly requires creating a separate Workrooms account through the web, downloading Workrooms in Oculus, and then pairing your headset to your Workrooms account by entering a code shown in the headset on your computer’s web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AK8gd7"&gt;Some features in Workrooms, like a personal drawing pad and giant whiteboard that anyone can go up to and use, feel more gimmicky than useful. There were multiple times when the audio cut out or became garbled, and the Quest’s hand tracking isn’t perfect. At one point Zuckerberg had to leave and rejoin the room because his avatar’s mouth wasn’t moving at all when he spoke. The desktop companion app isn’t yet compatible with Apple’s M1 processor, so I wasn’t able to try it on my 2020 MacBook Air. (A Facebook rep told me support is coming soon for Apple M1 computers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4atMns"&gt;Even with the bugs and relatively scaled-back graphics of the Quest compared to my MacBook screen, I still felt more present in Workrooms than I normally do in a traditional video conferencing setup like Zoom. Native arm and hand tracking, down to the movements of individual fingers, certainly helped. A larger factor is the Quest’s spatial audio. When someone talked in one corner of the room, it sounded like their voice was coming from that direction. At one point the seating chart was changed and I felt as if someone sitting behind me in VR was actually speaking from behind my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jbuI7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A much richer way to interact than the types of social apps we’ve been able to build on phones or computers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snudvu"&gt;Facebook has been using Workrooms internally for meetings for about six months, according to Zuckerberg. “These kinds of experiences, where you can actually feel present with other people, are I think a much richer way to interact than the types of social apps we’ve been able to build on phones or computers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="bqGw22"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Horizon: Zuckerberg|103542" data-volume-uuid="5fa2b9791" data-volume-id="103542" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-808" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg during a meeting in Horizon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pex3iP"&gt;Zuckerberg is right that VR feels more immersive than a phone or computer screen. But Workrooms — and the hardware that powers it — has a ways to go before it will be compelling enough to replace existing ways people work together and hang out at scale. But at the rate that Facebook’s Oculus hardware and software have been progressing, I expect experiences like Workrooms to be much more accessible and enticing in a couple of years than they are now. Other coming entrants into the space, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;such as Apple&lt;/a&gt;, will likely accelerate consumer interest in these sorts of headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNH9J1"&gt;Workrooms is part of a bigger umbrella project Facebook is building for Oculus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405249/facebook-vr-space-horizon-access-public-beta"&gt;called Horizon&lt;/a&gt;. Originally teased a couple of years ago, Horizon aims to essentially be the full Facebook universe — a metaverse, you could say — for virtual reality. Workrooms will be part of it, and Facebook has in the past demoed games and world-building tools similar to Minecraft or Roblox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeNrqS"&gt;Despite originally saying Horizon would debut in 2020, the experience remains in invite-only beta, and Facebook’s Bosworth declined to give me an exact timeframe for when that would change. He said the company has been focused on building more tools for creators, so they in turn can build things in Horizon for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji0xWm"&gt;That indicates Facebook wants Horizon to be a platform for other developers to build upon. Until Horizon comes out, Workrooms is the best glimpse yet at what Facebook means when it says it’s building the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
