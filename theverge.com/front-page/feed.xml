    <title>Gogoro is joining the battery swapping revolution in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P3fEbH4blPZzcgyinmZoiv6VBpk=/0x83:1981x1404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303868/Gogoro_Swap_Guy_L.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="io8EKq"&gt;Electric scooter company Gogoro continues to expand outside its home country of Taiwan in a big way, as it just announced new partnerships with a pair of China’s leading two-wheel manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="md8Jjw"&gt;DCJ, the top gas-powered motorcycle company in China, and Yadea, one of the biggest makers of electric scooters, motorcycles, bikes and mopeds, have each agreed to develop new two-wheelers that will use Gogoro’s swappable batteries and electric drivetrains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvZIOm"&gt;Gogoro CEO Horace Luke tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;the deals with DCJ and Yadea have been in the works for around two years and that the Chinese companies dug deep into Gogoro’s technology before deciding to partner up. The three companies are announcing the deals just as the Chinese government has begun to embrace battery swapping in a big way, like adopting a national standard for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/china-ev-swappable-battery-standards-approved/"&gt;tech in larger passenger vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRKRtC"&gt;To that end, DCJ and Yadea will deploy networks of Gogoro’s vending machine-sized battery swapping stations, starting in Hangzhou, as they work on new vehicles built on the Taiwanese startup’s tech. Gogoro’s battery swap stations can also help a local electric grid meet moments of high demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qomgGH"&gt;“We are on the path to make Gogoro’s standard the de facto standard with the intention of making these cities cleaner, better, and safer for all of us in the future,” Luke says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqdGXl"&gt;The announcement comes just a few weeks after Gogoro revealed that it’s entering the Indian market by way of a partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394575/gogoro-india-hero-motorcorp-electric-scooters-battery-swap-stations"&gt;that country’s leading two-wheel manufacturer, Hero MotorCorp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDVvQi"&gt;But while Gogoro will be working with Hero to essentially create the market for electric scooters in India, China presents the opposite opportunity. It’s the biggest market for electric two-wheelers in the world, but many of those scooters are using older battery technology that is a pain to charge and bad for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZNyhf"&gt;“China is completely the reverse, [where] a majority of the two-wheelers on the road today are electric. However, they’re shitty electric. The scooters are using lead-acid batteries that are clunky, [and] they don’t last very long,” Luke says. “When they use lithium battery, you [have to] carry the lithium ion battery back home to charge, it’s unsafe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwafCv"&gt;Gogoro’s batteries, meanwhile, are compact but energy dense, and can be easily popped in and out of the battery swapping stations. Luke says they’re extremely durable, too, claiming that the very first ones that Gogoro released into the wild are still being swapped in Taiwan today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtj33G"&gt;Terms of the deals were not disclosed, but expanding into China is a massive step for Gogoro, which came out of stealth mode in 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;at the Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt;. In the years since that debut, Gogoro has built out a massive network of scooters and battery-swapping stations across Taiwan, but Luke now refers to that as a “trial” ahead of these much larger partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who needs Super Nintendo World when an English town looks like this?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFt_gfrGvDacVaDDnN_VVDp7TL8=/0x0:615x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303826/0_updated_plant_p_678004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anita Maric / SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsRARN"&gt;In March this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Nintendo opened its Super Nintendo World theme park&lt;/a&gt; in Osaka, Japan. Now, just a few short months later, the &lt;a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/council-under-fire-over-leaving-20596223"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birmingham Mail &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that over a dozen giant green plant pots have been installed in Walsall, UK’s town center, prompting immediate comparisons to the Super Mario franchise. I’m not saying the two events are related, but the dots connect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soaadV"&gt;“It makes the place [look] more like something from Super Mario Brothers,” florist Andrea Loveridge told the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt;. “They look like those warp pipes Mario jumps down.” This is apparently a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qotxlt"&gt;According to local councillor Adrian Andrew, the pots are part of improvement works designed to “promote a feeling of wellbeing and safety and enhance the town centre environment.” He added that “a key element of this work was to introduce more planting into the town centre to create a more social space outside the Walsall Art Gallery.” Naturally, the warp pipes will also serve the immediate transportation needs of local Italian plumbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xyjYrL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Council under fire over leaving town centre looking 'like something from Super Mario Brothers' &lt;a href="https://t.co/FXFjEPFFU9"&gt;https://t.co/FXFjEPFFU9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Birmingham Live (@birmingham_live) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/birmingham_live/status/1393141590819065861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rb1QIn"&gt;“The colour is vile, they are a garish eyesore and a complete waste of taxpayer’s money,” resident Joanna Parrish told the &lt;em&gt;Birmingham Mail&lt;/em&gt;, while supermarket worker Sue Morrisson added that “they would look ok in a vibrant, modern town but in a dilapidated and tired looking town like Walsall, they just stand out like a sore thumb.” Critics also raised concerns about the cost of the pots, at a time when the council is having to slash millions from its budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znRH8g"&gt;Personally, I appreciate that a town is willing to take a punt on a weird bit of street furniture when so many are made up of the same identical collection of chain stores. Then again, I’m not the one who has to look at them every time I leave the house to buy a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZJlyW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lamborghini will debut its first all-electric supercar after 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KeDOLdtFe4re_wxxHQswN7HK3Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303610/lamborghini_terzo_millennio_7786.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aht6wh"&gt;The first all-electric Lamborghini is on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfXkQ3"&gt;The Italian automaker finally unveiled its electrification plans, which will proceed in two distinct phases over the next decade. By the end of 2024, the company plans to roll out gas-electric hybrid versions of its entire lineup. Following that, Lamborghini will debut its first all-electric model sometime before the end of the decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaVAyZ"&gt;That means plug-in hybrid versions of Aventador, Huracán, and Urus models will be arriving within the next three years, as well as limited production Sián roadsters. And sometime before 2030, Lamborghini will unveil a completely new all-electric fourth model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NMYau"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For sure, it’s the torque and the acceleration”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FR3U6r"&gt;Like other sports car companies, Lamborghini has been slow to embrace electric drivetrains, fearful of ostracizing its loyal customers who crave loud V8 and V12 engines and neck-snapping speed. But with emissions regulations tightening around the world and electric motors able to deliver 0–60 mph times that rival some of the fastest gas-powered supercars in the world, Lamborghini finally appears ready to change direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMS3Z0"&gt;“For sure, it’s the torque and the acceleration,” Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said when asked what his customers will find appealing about an electric supercar. “And also to fill the gaps now when you shift the gears and helping you to have a constant curve, which is, in my opinion, the things that they are going to appreciate the most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGKnQf"&gt;But it’s not just about the driving experience. Competition is heating up, with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ferrari-ev-bumped-to-2025/"&gt;Ferrari announcing&lt;/a&gt; that its first electric model will debut by 2025. Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/25/drako-gte-1-million-electric-supercar-driving-snow/"&gt;Drako&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116675/aston-martin-electric-rapide-lagonda-delay-stroll-investment"&gt;Aston Martin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086808/rimac-concept-two-electric-hypercar-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;Rimac&lt;/a&gt; have all been working on electric supercars with varying degrees of success. Lamborghini’s parent company, Volkswagen Group, has said it would spend 16 billion euros ($19 billion) and cease production of new internal combustion engines in favor of shifting toward electric vehicle production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svfSvv"&gt;Lamborghini hasn’t said whether it plans to completely phase out production of its gas-powered vehicles, but Winkelmann said the company is targeting a 50 percent “or more” reduction of its CO2 emissions by the beginning of 2025. The company plans to spend 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) on the hybrid and electrification transformation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xyzy7MYS_RPc5gyd_mNOJmM-2Bs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9621731/Lamborghini_Terzo_Millennio_3_4_front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Terzo Millennio is a “technological demonstrator” of what an electric Lamborghini could look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aL6WYQ"&gt;“We are speaking about the biggest investment ever done in Lamborghini,” he added. “[It is] very important to keep a growth which is sustainable, to have a growth which is taking into consideration the needs of the planet, but also keeping this in line with the dream of our customers to have a super sports car which is excellent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMtIxU"&gt;Lamborghini’s sudden interest in electrification isn’t coming completely out of the blue. In 2017, the company unveiled its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/11/6/16613998/lamborghini-terzo-millennio-electric-concept-car-photos"&gt;Terzo Millennio concept&lt;/a&gt;. Designed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the static concept car was a treasure chest of wild, futuristic ideas, including the idea of using supercapacitors to replace standard lithium-ion batteries and a self-repairing process to help prevent cracks in the body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J3uMZa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The technology is very fast moving”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7aNWyl"&gt;It’s not clear whether Lamborghini plans to apply anything from the Terzo Millennio, which Winkelmann called a “technological demonstrator” to its new hybrid and electric models. “The technology is very fast moving,” he said. “So we will have to adapt everything to what needs to be valid a decade from now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8BM13"&gt;That said, Lamborghini said it will spend the next two years “celebrating the combustion engine,” which it says has contributed to the company’s recent financial success. The Italian automaker had arguably one of its best years in 2020, despite even a mandatory two-month factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It delivered 7,430 cars during the year, down only 9 percent from the record high in 2019. Sales topped 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion), down 11 percent from 2019, but the company said profits increased to a record high as customers ordered more pricey, highly customized cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkdLCY"&gt;Whether Lamborghini’s “celebration” of its classic gas-powered vehicles will mean the introduction of new one-offs or special models, Winkelmann wouldn’t confirm. “Wait a few weeks and then we will have some nice things to show for sure,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZG81B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is in talks to buy MGM for $9 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MGM Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wegblktq-oWrF2eqz4NAKJbeeSk=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69302360/mgm-logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SHv5gJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rocky&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Stargate&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Robocop&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Legally Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vikings&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Holdings#Content_libraries"&gt;a historic catalog&lt;/a&gt; of films dating back many decades, an array of production and distribution companies, and the content network Epix — these are the things that Amazon might own if it buys storied film giant MGM for billions of dollars in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7ZW6h"&gt;Amazon has reportedly offered $9 billion for the company, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-mgm-acquisition-talks-9-billion-1234975168/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, following &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-pondering-deal-to-buy-mgm?"&gt;a scoop from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the day that suggested a range of $7-10 billion for a potential deal, and &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;suggests that $9 billion was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; the amount that MGM was reportedly hoping to get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzrCGA"&gt;Between those factors, the fact that MGM has been up for sale since December 2020, and the jealousy that comes with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;sudden impending existence of a new media giant earlier today as AT&amp;amp;T spins off WarnerMedia and combines it with Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, it wouldn’t be very surprising if Amazon and MGM made a deal. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; was slightly less bullish in its report today, though, writing that “The status of Amazon’s discussions with MGM is unclear and it’s possible no deal will result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc4EHb"&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/22/hollywood-giant-mgm-puts-itself-up-for-sale-at-5bn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that MGM has a library of 4,000 films and 17,000 hours of TV. James Bond in particular is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_franchises_and_film_series"&gt;one of the most valuable film franchises ever made&lt;/a&gt; — a list that’s only growing smaller as the Disney umbrella and Marvel Cinematic Universe swallow as many rivals as it can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D92P09"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, usually costing $90. Released in 2019, this base Kindle model includes a front light, comes in one storage configuration of 8GB, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is its usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for the usual price of $110. Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; also have a promotion where you can receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. You can grab one for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its normal price of $110&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is also offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $128&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a screen protector and power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available, but if you want to buy one in the near future, the Kindle Paperwhite is on sale for the price it usually tends to sell for; you can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 without ads&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want an ad-free model, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this configuration for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon also discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads). If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads on the lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, you can grab one of the many configurations plus three free months of Kindle Unlimited for the normal price starting at $250. The ad-supported &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/ref=mako_bundletwister_cg1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-support configuration for $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSTQZ9M/ref=mako_bundletwister_cg1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $320&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple HomePod and HomePod mini can’t play lossless Apple Music, either</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXp9y9T3Sq1JLdxDiA3OqH9LwiY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69302215/dseifert_201107_4281_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpQZWb"&gt;Today, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440788/apple-airpods-max-lossless-music-explainer-spatial-audio"&gt;Apple’s ultra-premium $550 AirPods Max headphones aren’t ready for the new lossless audio catalog&lt;/a&gt; coming to Apple Music next month — and they’re not alone. Apple confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the HomePod and HomePod mini won’t support lossless audio, either. (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/homepod-wont-support-lossless-audio/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the same thing with sources&lt;/a&gt; earlier this afternoon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brjFbG"&gt;The good news is that the HomePod and HomePod mini will indeed support the company’s new &lt;em&gt;spatial&lt;/em&gt; audio experiences, which are supposed to provide more immersive audio than a standard stereo or virtual surround mix — we were fairly intrigued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;trying spatial audio on the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s also coming to Apple Music next month in a bigger way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z13Cjy"&gt;And, Apple says, it’s not like any of these devices will fail to play back lossless tracks completely. They simply won’t be playing them at lossless quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNasQp"&gt;Still, it seems like one more reason that Apple should really strongly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;consider having a fire sale for the original HomePod&lt;/a&gt;, which is somehow still available for a increasingly hard-to-justify $300 months after officially being discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Phil Schiller gives Epic iPhone testimony</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Trial With Epic Threatens To Reveal App Store’s Commission Bounty" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0gRFHHDFdCsbRL8vZvs0WOukzLk=/0x0:2738x1825/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69302193/1232892504.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;What does ‘locked in’ mean, though?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cbiQUK"&gt;We’ve gotten through the expert witnesses of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, and as a reward, Phil Schiller — currently an “Apple Fellow,” whatever that is, and previously the senior vice president of worldwide marketing — took the stand like a twinkly App Store St. Nick. To hear him tell it, Apple is a wonderful partner to developers, selflessly improving dev tools and responding to their needs. At times the testimony feels like a prolonged ad for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="167QOY"&gt;The goal of the testimony is to paint the App Store as a part of the iPhone that can’t be removed or replaced by a competing alternative. To this end, we heard in exhaustive detail about the improvements made to the iPhone that benefit the developers in the App Store. The chips. The Retina display. The accelerometer. The wireless upgrades. It’s practically an Apple event on the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlcpDk"&gt;Among the exhaustive list, Schiller identified Metal, one of the developer tools Apple created. (Metal is a play on “close to the metal,” or writing code that’s close to the computer’s guts.) Apple’s counsel says the lawyer version of “roll tape!” and we’re treated to a 20 second clip of Tim Sweeney on stage at WWDC, praising Metal as a wonderful tool that will allow developers like Epic Games to create the next generation of improvements. Solid burn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YVz0CV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schiller’s testimony spends some quality time back in 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRIZcI"&gt;The overall impression I get from the list of improvements is, essentially, that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; absolutely could not have launched on the first generation of iPhones — the hardware and chips couldn’t have handled the game. That is true! Also: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;didn’t exist yet, so that’s a pretty good reason it couldn’t have been on those early iPhones. But there is another reason a time-traveling &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t have launched on the first iPhones in 2007: the App Store didn’t exist yet, either. This particular fact is somewhat inconvenient for Apple’s argument that the iPhone and the App Store are inseparable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKRVeo"&gt;Schiller’s testimony spends some quality time back in 2007, to explain the origin of the App Store. When the iPhone launched, the only apps on it were Apple’s own; all other apps were web apps. In response, there was a spate of “jailbreaking” — essentially, hacking the iPhone so you could put your own apps on it. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; was the genesis of the App Store: Apple realizing that people were going to put their own apps on the iPhone no matter what it did. If it wanted control of the process, it was going to have to create an official route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOIOKP"&gt;From the jump, security was going to be a concern, Schiller said. After all, the point of the phone was that you could &lt;em&gt;carry it around&lt;/em&gt; — which involved collecting location data. So iOS was built from the ground up with this in mind, Schiller says. (This line of testimony is a rebuttal to Epic’s argument that MacOS allows side-loading, and it is therefore anticompetitive that iOS does not.) To put a stop to the jailbreaking, Apple did something unusual: rather than showing the world a finished product, it announced it was &lt;em&gt;working on something&lt;/em&gt;. That something was the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="dpS1zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Look, “locked in” has an accepted meaning, and it’s not a very friendly one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ey5O2Q"&gt;The Steve Jobs line that Epic has touted — ”We don’t intend to make money off the App Store” — comes from these early days. At the time of this announcement, Apple didn’t know if it would make money, Schiller testified. He also suggests that the line was not a promise that Apple would &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;make money. The App Store was a “huge” risk, Schiller said. “We’re taking our hot new product and putting something we’ve never done before on it, and we have no apps yet! So we have no idea how this is going to do.” This is credible. What is less convincing is Schiller’s attempt to redefine what it means to “lock customers into our ecosystem,” a phrase that comes from a Jobs email entered into evidence earlier in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX3kF0"&gt;Look, “locked in” has an accepted meaning, and it’s not a very friendly one: prisoners, for example, are locked in. Schiller gives this the old college try anyhow, telling the court that the idea behind “locked in” was just to make services more attractive, so that customers wouldn’t want to leave. Later in the email, Jobs talks about making the ecosystem even more “sticky,” which is less menacing, but — glue traps are sticky. So are flystrips. When was the last time that being stuck to something was positive for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b3Eox"&gt;But hey, Schiller’s a marketer. He was Apple’s marketing guy for &lt;em&gt;actual decades&lt;/em&gt;! Always be closing, baby. And so if it at times seemed like he presented Apple as though it were a selfless do-gooder, responding to devs’ requests for in-app payments — which was a then-nascent business — by building capability for that into the store, well, that’s his job. Still, presenting one of the most ruthlessly efficient cash machines in tech as a helpful friend of small developers is kind of like painting a whale shark orange and calling it a goldfish who feeds other goldfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9PVvV"&gt;Despite Schiller’s friendly demeanor, some of his testimony is a stretch. For instance, he says he doesn’t see mobile as a duopoly. He lists Samsung, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon as competition. The Amazon Fire phone was discontinued in 2015, as was the Windows Phone. Perhaps they haunt his dreams, but they certainly don’t haunt the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VbCnf0"&gt;But Schiller mostly does what he needs to do for Apple — as I suppose he has for 30-odd years. He’s cheerful, pleasant to listen to, and at times, very convincing. The question in this case, though, is if marketing to a judge is as easy as marketing to Apple customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus’ latest Quest update lets you record gameplay and yourself at the same time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oculus Live Overlay" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qx2j4P7bOpiv5Rz3lbJiNRL73EQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300645/oculusliveoverlay.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oculus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PO5Lxs"&gt;Oculus will soon roll out its v29 software for Quest and Quest 2 headsets, and this one adds more features and functionality to the lineup. The most exciting one is a new Live Overlay casting feature that will give you an easy way to capture a view of you using VR superimposed over the content displayed in first-person within your headset. Any VR app that supports casting and recording will work with this feature, according to Oculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUoflT"&gt;All you’ll need is at least an iPhone XS or newer, a Quest headset, and the Oculus app for iOS updated to a new version that’s coming to “a subset of users.” Then you turn on the feature and have someone aim the camera at you (or aim it at yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQWF1"&gt;If this sounds familiar, you might be thinking of &lt;a href="https://creator.oculus.com/mrc/"&gt;Oculus’ Mixed Reality Creator Tool&lt;/a&gt; (MRC) for Quest and Rift S. That app requires a capable PC, including a rig with 16GB of RAM, a decent graphics card, your own 1080p webcam, a 5GHz Wi-Fi router, and — of course — your own green screen. The big difference according to Oculus is that the Mixed Reality Capture Tool “synchronizes the person perfectly with VR, whereas Live Overlay places the user over a first-person casting view.” So, while mixed reality &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRywAihJ2jM"&gt;shows you actually doing cool things in virtual environments&lt;/a&gt;, Live Overlay appears to show what you see through the headset with you standing in the same frame, like the image above illustrates. Still, it’s impressive if you’re a creator who wants to show off gameplay and themselves in the same clip with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X239Dy"&gt;In other casting news, Oculus is allowing you to capture what you’re saying into your headset’s built-in microphone during casting sessions or when you’re recording a video clip. It’s also extending multi-user support and the app sharing feature to owners of the original Quest, so multiple people can share games on a single headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289577/facebook-rolling-out-multi-user-support-oculus-quest-2"&gt;These features were originally limited to the Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, but Oculus is making good on its pledge to bring them to the Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus files app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IepGoo1U9sDFI_bY0nFAkTrx9lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520891/oculusfilemanager.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4REj2I"&gt;There’s a Files app coming with this update, and it’ll be located within your app library. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fsee-yourself-in-vr-with-live-overlay-plus-new-infinite-office-features-and-more-in-latest-oculus-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus says in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; that you’ll be able to download and upload media files “to and from your favorite websites” through the browser built into the headset. In other words, it should be a lot easier to upload content to social media sites other than Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5LvsE"&gt;The last couple of additions include an Infinite Office update that lets iOS users (using an iPhone 7 and newer, with Android support coming soon) see lock screen notifications from within a Quest headset. Oculus is also adding a shortcut for its Passthrough command to the user interface in the Quick Settings menu, giving you an alternative method of triggering it instead of physically double-tapping the side of your headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SmwFs"&gt;Lastly, Oculus will begin showing ads for VR experiences within the mobile app with the intent to broaden discovery for both developers looking for an audience and users to find new content. This could be useful for smaller developers who have built quality experiences but don’t have the awareness of more popular apps. That said, if you’re a curious Quest owner looking for new experiences, I suggest checking out SideQuest on PC or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22395923/sidequest-android-app-sideload-oculus-quest-2-virtual-reality-apps-games-experiences"&gt;from an Android phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4iCgsa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Capcom’s Resident Evil 4 VR remake launches this year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396528/capcom-resident-evil-4-oculus-quest-2-remake-trailer-footage-launch-date"},{"title":"All about Oculus’ new, more expressive avatars","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398060/oculus-new-avatars-editor-features-vr-virtual-reality-facebook-quest-rift"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gDgrCc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: The new Live Overlay mode is not a full mixed-reality mode where you can film someone moving around inside a VR environment from the outside; it primarily shows a first-person view. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="btxLkZ"&gt;London’s long-awaited electric scooter trials will begin next month on June 7th, the city’s transport authority and local councils announced today. Three scooter companies have been selected to offer rentals for up to 12 months as part of the pilot program: Dott, Lime, and Tier. Privately owned electric scooters will continue to be illegal to ride on streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCUUE8"&gt;The selected companies will initially offer scooters to rent across six boroughs and local authorities in London: Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Richmond upon Thames, the City of London, and Canary Wharf. While rentals will not be available in Tower Hamlets, Londoners will be able to ride their rented scooters through the borough. Lambeth and Southwark boroughs are also seeking to participate in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI4iWg"&gt;This might sound like a long list of areas, but it’s just a fraction of the 32 boroughs that make up the UK’s capital. London’s transport authority Transport for London (TfL) says more areas are expected to join the trial as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A3h8iK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The trials will only cover a small portion of the city&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KZuVWD"&gt;While rented electric scooters have become a common sight across many cities around the world, the UK has been much slower to embrace the new form of transport. Until recently, electric scooters were completely illegal to ride on British streets. It was only in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307974/uk-electric-scooter-rentals-legal-public-roads-micro-mobility"&gt;July last year&lt;/a&gt; that the situation started to change, with the government allowing trials of electric scooter rentals. But outside of the pilot programs, privately owned electric scooters are still illegal to ride on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP1OU7"&gt;TfL’s announcement specifically cites the pandemic as a key reason for the importance of the new method of transport. Rather than having people flock to cars as a way of avoiding crowded buses and trains, authorities want electric scooters to offer an environmentally friendly and socially distanced way of getting around. “We’re doing all we can to support London’s safe and sustainable recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and it’s clear that e-scooters could act as an innovative, greener alternative to car trips,” said TfL’s electric scooter trial lead Helen Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcy2cc"&gt;Each electric scooter rental company will have to comply with a host of safety requirements to offer rentals in the city. Speeds will be capped at 12.5 miles per hour (reducing to eight miles per hour in specified “go-slow” areas), and scooters will be required to have always-on front and rear lights. They’re also required to have “audible warning systems” that riders can operate without taking their hands off the handlebars. The scooters will also be equipped with geofencing to ensure that they’re correctly parked in designated locations, and operators will have to collect them if they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCQny8"&gt;Scooters can be ridden on roads and cycle paths but not on sidewalks. When the government announced the start of the trials last year, it said riders would have to be over the age of 16 and have at least a provisional car, motorcycle, or moped license to ride. We’ve reached out to TfL to clarify whether these requirements will apply to the London trials. Riders will also need to take an “e-learning safety course” before hiring their first scooter in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vctCy5"&gt;London will be far from the first city in the UK to have launched its electric scooter trials. &lt;a href="https://mindthezag.com/places/where-are-the-uks-e-scooter-trials/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zag &lt;/em&gt;has compiled a list&lt;/a&gt; of over 50 trials that have been launched across the country over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hswD65"&gt;&lt;q&gt;London is the latest UK city to announce a trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XTI0FN"&gt;Despite technically being illegal to use on public streets, privately owned electric scooters have become an increasingly common sight in London. National retailers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Fscooters%2Felectric-scooters%2F%3Fcm_mmc%3DGoogle-_-KZ%2520-%2520Kids%2520Scooters%2520-%2520Own%2520Brand-_-Electric%2520Scooters%2520Exact-_-ad%26source%3Dppc%26_%2524ja%3Dtsid%3A35522%257Ccid%3A9696423349%257Cagid%3A96673753582%257Ctid%3Akwd-440281686218%257Ccrid%3A427046351899%257Cnw%3Ag%257Crnd%3A17179386706488057195%257Cdvc%3Ac%257Cadp%3A%257Cmt%3Ae%257Cloc%3A9045992%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwqIiFBhAHEiwANg9szmYVfaHPyq6JDYzbIUbfUev_aoZ_RTpvdFwpCEK-YIlA16vnObSx8xoC27gQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F17%2F22440320%2Flondon-electric-scooter-rental-trial-dott-lime-tier" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like Halfords&lt;/a&gt; sell a range of models, although Halfords’ website carries a warning that they’re only legal on private property with the owner’s permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBp41A"&gt;The three scooter operators chosen for London’s trials already offer rentals in other cities around the world. Dott offers rentals across 16 cities in Europe, while Tier serves 100 cities across 12 countries. As well as offering electric scooter rentals in other cities, Lime has previously offered electric bike rentals in London. Notably absent from the list is Bird, which has offered electric scooter rentals on private property in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18067670/bird-electric-scooters-uk-london-pilot-launch-european-expansion"&gt;London’s Olympic Park&lt;/a&gt;. London has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335611/paris-electric-scooter-competition-lime-tier-dott-bird"&gt;joined Paris&lt;/a&gt; in deciding against allowing the company to operate on its streets, even after it announced a massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332624/bird-europe-investment-scooter-expansion-new-hires"&gt;$150 million European expansion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Cx9GC"&gt;As well as setting their own pricing, individual scooter operators are offering some unique features. Tier, for example, is installing charging pods in local businesses across the city and will give users free rides if they exchange their scooters’ drained battery for a fully charged one at a charging station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u60Xn6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fox is making a blockchain animated series with Rick and Morty creator Dan Harmon to sell you NFTs</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsTsrk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox.com/krapopolis/"&gt;Fox has announced&lt;/a&gt; its upcoming animated comedy &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis, &lt;/em&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; creator Dan Harmon, will be “the first-ever animated series curated entirely on the Blockchain.” The company plans to try to generate buzz for the show with its own brand-new NFT company dubbed Blockchain Creative Labs, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/dan-harmon-blockchain-nft-crypto-series-fox-1234954403/"&gt;THR reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdCdpm"&gt;Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier told advertisers during its upfronts presentation on Monday that “as an advertiser-focused, artist-first and animation-obsessed company, Fox is going to take advertisers into the world of Blockchain-powered tokens, including NFTs.” It will launch a dedicated marketplace for &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis&lt;/em&gt;, a show set in mythical ancient Greece “centered on a flawed family of humans, gods, and monsters that tries to run one of the world’s first cities without killing each other.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="EoCpCN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VfrI0E"&gt;The marketplace will “curate and sell digital goods ranging from NFTs of one-of-a-kind character and background art and GIFs, as well as tokens that provide exclusive social experiences to engage and reward super fans,” according to Fox. Characters and artwork from the show will become NFT collectibles — because why let the internet GIF your show for free when you can sell them GIFs as NFTs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zflZ6Q"&gt;NFTs of some well-known memes have proven lucrative for their creators, including &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bad-luck-brian-meme-nft-crypto-art-blockchain-ethereum-foundation-2021-3"&gt;Bad Luck Brian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/grumpycat/grumpy-cat-5467"&gt;Grumpy Cat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/keyboardcat/play-him-off-keyboard-cat-5553"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt;. The image of Disaster Girl, whose real name is Zoe Roth, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;went for $500,000&lt;/a&gt;, and Nyan Cat’s creator Chris Torres sold &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html"&gt;that meme for nearly $600,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iw8vd"&gt;A whole show that will produce NFT-ready content is a new twist on the idea, however, and counts on &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis&lt;/em&gt; becoming popular enough to attract bidders. &lt;/p&gt;
