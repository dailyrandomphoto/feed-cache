    <title>Microsoft is selling ugly Windows sweaters again, and this time, it’s Minesweeper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6MTwvIZyRFLnDl90nToW4trz_w=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212345/Downloads_TeamsBackgrounds.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jSDoGm"&gt;Microsoft has launched a new Windows software-themed ugly sweater on its &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/windows"&gt;Xbox Gear Shop&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the infamous Windows game &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd2Ed1"&gt;It’s well done: not only is the whole &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; level shaped like a Christmas tree, but it’s also got mines masquerading as snowflakes and “buttons” to minimize the window or exit the game if you so desire, plus the classic wavy Windows logo that hearkens back to Windows 3.1. (If you’re wondering why the sweater has “1990” remaining mines, that’s a reference to the year &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; first came out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FCEnxn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Whatchu know about Minesweeper? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UglyChristmasSweater?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UglyChristmasSweater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsUglySweater?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsUglySweater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nWnn42uyw2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nWnn42uyw2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1465452689974861826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T5GNSb"&gt;This is Microsoft’s second year of Windows-themed ugly sweaters. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21779499/microsoft-windows-ugly-sweater-paint-xp-95-girls-who-code"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, the company released three ugly sweater designs, including one garment based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512247/microsoft-paint-windows-10-app-comments"&gt;timeless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;MS Paint&lt;/em&gt; application, which humorously looked as if it were designed in that very app. In 2020, Microsoft donated a portion of the proceeds from each sweater to Girls Who Code; this year, the company appears to be giving a lump sum of $100,000 to the &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.networkforgood.com/projects/82475-the-ablegamers-charity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/em&gt; charity&lt;/a&gt; for gamers with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiBCW6"&gt;Microsoft is selling the &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; ugly sweater for the explosive price of $74.99 — $5 more expensive than last year’s designs. The sweaters &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-microsoft-paint-holiday-sweaters-2020-12"&gt;sold out in 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; last year with a late December restock, so if you want to look like a pro at flagging mines this holiday, then &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/products/microsoft-windows-minesweeper-sweater"&gt;get one soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Edge users aren’t happy about Microsoft’s built-in ‘buy now, pay later’ tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8LbkY2zGtKz8MzRxB44-oL8l_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212337/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kB5NU"&gt;Microsoft is tacking on a “buy now, pay later” extension to Edge that prompts users to use short-term financing service &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzip.co%2Fus&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F30%2F22810595%2Fmicrosoft-edge-zip-buy-now-pay-later" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zip&lt;/a&gt; (formerly QuadPay) when making a purchase on the browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SR1VEb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The option to sign up and use Zip will appear on checkout pages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M2KKE5"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2967030"&gt;company introduced the service&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, and now some users are reportedly seeing it integrated into their browsers after updating to Edge version 96, as noted by &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/11/microsoft-plans-to-integrate-a-buy-now-pay-later-app-into-edge/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The option to sign up and use Zip will be displayed on checkout pages, appearing in the same area where you’d enter your credit card number on Edge (or access a previously used one), and will sometimes be ingrained in the checkout page itself. Zip will pop up when Edge detects that your purchase costs between $35 and $1,000, the price range that the service can cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HVZhY"&gt;While Zip lets you make purchases without spending anything upfront, this comes in exchange for four interest-free payments over a six-week period. Even still, the service technically isn’t free — it charges $1 for every payment you make, meaning you’ll end up spending $4 more on your purchase, no matter the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPDNp5"&gt;Edge will give you the option to pay through Zip by default, whether the store even offers the option or not. On a &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge-4f7db926-7bc8-4a9e-bd2d-d0831bc3038f"&gt;Microsoft support&lt;/a&gt; page, the company indicates that merchants will actually have to contact Microsoft if they don’t want customers using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CwzTO0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft added Buy Now Pay Later into Edge (and so Windows 10 and 11 base OS), a thing which is known to be abused to harm people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tags on the post on Microsoft’s website say it all. Keep speaking out. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wsujv2VdWN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wsujv2VdWN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1465613506376613894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2rbmhj"&gt;The feature has come under heavy criticism, with some users upset about the extra bloatware &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2980646/highlight/true#M6061"&gt;slowing down their browsing experience&lt;/a&gt; and others concerned about the &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2978607/highlight/true#M6050"&gt;potential financial ramifications&lt;/a&gt; on users, especially for those who struggle to manage their credit. “Buy now, pay later” services have also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/criminals-exploit-buy-now-pay-later-services-like-klarna-and-afterpay.html"&gt;been a target for criminals&lt;/a&gt;, who can exploit them to score free goods, as they typically don’t check credit scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfP5wE"&gt;Plus, Edge already has built-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575038/microsoft-edge-coupons-promo-codes-feature-pdf-annotation-screenshot-inking"&gt;promo code and coupon alerts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507374/microsoft-edge-price-comparisons-screenshot-tool-features"&gt;product price comparisons&lt;/a&gt; that pop up while you’re shopping. Microsoft even goes out of its way to explain that it doesn’t collect a fee for using Zip, so it’s unclear why the company is opting both buyers and sellers into an offer no one asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon faces new pressure over COVID protections in warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Protesters Strike On Essentials Workers Rights Outside An Amazon Facility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xECE2lm1DJCU5h7cXklT-9k7H8o=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212230/1211474779.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon workers protested outside a warehouse last year | Spencer Platt / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DtAefE"&gt;Amazon is facing new questions over failed COVID protections in its fulfillment centers, spurred on by New York Attorney General Letitia James. After more than a year of protests from workers and inquiries from legislators, James is now seeking a court order to require Amazon to appoint a monitor to oversee health and safety measures at its warehouse on Staten Island. As part of the same motion, James asked the company to reinstate fired worker Christian Smalls, who led public protests against Amazon last year, accusing the company of failing to keep employees from contracting the virus at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgSbGP"&gt;According to James, Amazon has rolled back many of its health and safety measures at the warehouse, known as JFK8. The Staten Island warehouse, which employs roughly 5,000 people, has been the site of an ongoing tug of war between Amazon and its employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J18lhp"&gt;“Amazon and its leadership banked billions of dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as the crisis rages on, the health and concerns of the workers continue to be ignored,” James &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-seeks-emergency-relief-protect-rights-and-safety-amazon"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Amazon must guarantee a work environment that promotes safety, transparency, and respect for its hardworking employees, not one that further endangers them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftQV0Z"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;Amazon pre-emptively sued the New York AG’s office&lt;/a&gt;, saying the office lacked the legal authority to demand legal remedies for the company’s handling of COVID-19 conditions at JFK8. James’ office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;filed suit against the company&lt;/a&gt; four days later, alleging Amazon failed to protect its warehouse employees in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and retaliated against workers who raised concerns about what they viewed as insufficient safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpGYSa"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s JKF8 warehouse said in March 2020 that they didn’t have enough &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;protective equipment&lt;/a&gt; and were not informed if their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194739/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-outraged-informed"&gt;co-workers tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BZmus8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Warehouse workers are forcing Amazon to take COVID-19 seriously","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XJ6PIL"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233891/amazon-coronavirus-protest-sick-out-tech-workers-climate-justice"&gt;fired several workers who protested&lt;/a&gt; the conditions, including Smalls, after the workers staged public protests. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/technology/amazon-coronavirus-whistleblowers.html"&gt;Amazon said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that Smalls and the other workers were not fired for protesting but for violating social distancing rules. James sought an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board, calling Smalls’ firing “disgraceful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gkiXm"&gt;James says in the latest motion, filed in New York’s state Supreme Court, that Amazon “unlawfully fired and disciplined workers who reported their concerns about the company’s compliance with these health and safety mandates, including Christian Smalls.” James is also seeking a court order to reinstate Smalls on an interim basis, pending the outcome of the lawsuit. The suit claims Smalls’ firing served as intimidation to other employees who may be afraid to come forward with additional concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1goff"&gt;James also alleges that Amazon violated state law when it failed to conduct adequate cleaning protocols, according to an investigation by her office, and that its contact tracing program failed to identify workers who had come into contact with others who tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKyDFS"&gt;The motion asks the court to order Amazon to change how it monitors employees’ productivity to allow time for cleaning and social distancing and require the company to adopt adequate disinfection protocols when an infected worker has been in the facility. The AG’s office also wants the company to institute better COVID-19 contact tracing protocols, which would include notifying close contacts of infected workers. The suit seeks to have a court-appointed monitor oversee these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTl1yD"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company had incurred more than $15 billion in costs as part of a “comprehensive approach to COVID-19 safety” measures, to support customers and employees. “It’s disappointing that the Attorney General is seeking to politicize the pandemic by asking for ‘emergency’ relief now despite having filed this lawsuit nine months ago,” Nantel continued, adding that the company had “listened to and learned from the experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzpCJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: November 30th 7:11 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Amazon spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip is here to power the Android flagships of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FP9dyJyaIVdY_TvNUruvjV_Cx0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212202/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuNSYq"&gt;Qualcomm has a new flagship smartphone processor: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, announced at the company’s annual Snapdragon Tech Summit, giving an early preview at the brains behind the most powerful smartphones of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9IvvH"&gt;The successor to last year’s Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chipset to bear Qualcomm’s new naming scheme (which the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796541/qualcomm-snapdragon-branding-naming-scheme-changes-updates"&gt;previously teased last week&lt;/a&gt;), ditching the triple-digit numbering system that Qualcomm has previously used for new, generation-based monikers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB2M3v"&gt;As is the case every year, Qualcomm is promising some major improvements in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, with better performance, camera technology, AI capabilities, security, and 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2juAI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;20 percent better CPU performance and up to 30 percent CPU power efficiency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Od6QyN"&gt;Let’s start with the hard specs. As expected, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chip from Qualcomm to use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22448107/arm-armv9-architecure-cortex-x2-a710-cpu-mali-g710-gpu-android-2022-designs"&gt;latest Armv9 architecture from Arm&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the new eight-core Kryo CPU will feature a single prime core based on the Cortex-X2 at 3.0GHz, along with three performance cores based on Cortex-A710 at 2.5GHz, and a quartet of efficiency cores based on the Cortex-A510 design at 1.8GHz. Additionally, the new chip jumps to a 4nm process, from the 5nm process on which the Snapdragon 888 was built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJ3LTB"&gt;All told, Qualcomm promises that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 will offer up to 20 percent better performance and up to 30 percent more power efficiency over last year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYm24t"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Adreno GPU (much like the Gen 1’s Kryo CPU, Qualcomm didn’t give a specific number for the updated hardware here) promises to offer 30 percent faster graphics rendering, in addition to 25 percent better power efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 888. It’ll also offer a new GPU control panel for fine-tuning how games are running on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4juexRZOAnmC4QbR2ZCXAq0eqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053637/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Block_Diagram.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OkrJfj"&gt;Making its debut on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274127/qualcomm-x65-5g-modem-10gbps-speeds-ai-tuning-software-updates"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X65 modem&lt;/a&gt;, which promises a whole suite of 5G features and firsts. As Qualcomm’s fourth-generation 5G modem, it builds on the existing mmWave and sub-6GHz compatibility that came before, adding support for up to 10Gbps speeds and the latest 3GPP Release 16 specification. As is always the case, you almost certainly won’t actually see that kind of speed in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5nkUO"&gt;The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth LE Audio (a first for Qualcomm), and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652655/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-announced-snapdragon-sound"&gt;company’s Snapdragon Sound technology&lt;/a&gt; for enabling AptX Lossless wireless audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wzUiT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;18-bit RAW photos and 8K HDR video — if your camera can handle it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9bnlut"&gt;As is traditional for Qualcomm’s top-tier processor, the company is putting a big emphasis on its beefed-up camera capabilities, which the company is bundling together for the first time under a new “Snapdragon Sight” brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMw4vp"&gt;While the Spectra ISP is once again a triple ISP system, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 upgrades things up to an 18-bit system (up from 14 bits on the 888). That translates to 4,096 times more camera data and up to four additional stops of dynamic range for very bright or very dark scenarios. The triple ISP (image signal processor) also allows for things like shooting 240 12-megapixel photos in a single second or simultaneously shooting in 8K with HDR while snapping 64-megapixel stills thanks to an increased 3.2-gigapixel per second throughput.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxZitX"&gt;Qualcomm is also offering more high-end camera features out of the box, including support for shooting in 8K video with HDR 10 Plus and shooting in 18-bit RAW (assuming your phone has the camera hardware to actually pull it off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxU45a"&gt;The 8 Gen 1 also features a variety of other imaging improvements, including better dark mode pictures that can use data from up to 30 images in a single shot (up from six images on the 888). There’s also a host of better AI processing techniques, with improved auto-exposure, auto-focus, and auto-face detection technology, a dedicated “bokeh engine” for adding portrait effects to 4K video, and an “ultrawide engine” that can de-warp and remove chromatic aberrations from shots. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WcfdqVR73HgJz6eUJCWh9VGLo2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053641/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Chip_Image.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3IESWU"&gt;Qualcomm is also adding a &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; ISP, located in the dedicated sensing hub on the SoC: unlike the triple ISP for the primary camera, the new ISP is designed specifically to power an always-on camera that’s active at all times. Qualcomm has some big ambitions for what developers can do with the always-on camera, like automatically shutting off your screen when you put your phone down or if it detects someone trying to read over your shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR5cbn"&gt;And while the idea of an always-on camera raises some obvious security concerns, Qualcomm argues that the feature is intended to help make using your device &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; secure, with any camera data for the always-on camera staying locally on-device in the chip’s secure enclave. Additionally, customers will be able to opt in to using the always-on camera, much in the same way that they can choose whether to use an always-listening microphone feature for voice assistants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w34JYb"&gt;Still, though, the added capability — and how manufacturers implement it into their devices, if they do at all — will be something to watch when the first chips with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O377mH"&gt;On the AI side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 features Qualcomm’s latest Hexagon processor, with its seventh-generation AI engine, which the company says is four times faster than its predecessor and up to 1.7 times more power efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wTFjT"&gt;The company showed off a variety of use cases that the boosted AI performance can enable, including the aforementioned camera functionality, a “Leica Leitz Look mode” that emulates Leica lens effects, and improved detection of where you’re holding your phone for optimizing antenna performance. Additionally, Qualcomm is adding AI-powered sampling to offer a DLSS-style effect for improving mobile games, something that it says will happen automatically when gaming on the 8 Gen 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VpVaCh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four times better AI performance compared to last year’s model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyRwV5"&gt;Lastly, there are security improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 adds a new hardware-level layer of security with a “dedicated Trust Management Engine,” in addition to offering support for the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/security/android-ready-se"&gt;Android Ready SE standard&lt;/a&gt;, enabling support for digital car keys, driver’s licenses, IDs, and e-money wallets. There’s also built-in iSIM support for directly connecting to cellular networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9agPT"&gt;Despite the new branding, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 doesn’t appear to break the mold for Qualcomm’s chips, offering the usual generational upgrades we’ve come to expect from the company’s annual flagships. Still, in a world where bespoke chips like Google’s Tensor or Apple’s A-series processors are becoming increasingly popular, it’s good to see that Qualcomm has no intention of slowing the pace on its own top chips, even as the competition heats up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ouwCZ"&gt;And with the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 smartphones expected before the end of 2021, it won’t be long before we’ll be able to see just how powerful Qualcomm’s latest chip is for ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch will use machine learning to detect people evading bans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16eNsKt54O1UZ9ZhpX00mMGw_BQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211930/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="juAUUW"&gt;Twitch is furthering its efforts to reduce harassment with a new tool that uses machine learning to detect people who may be attempting to evade bans. It’s the company’s latest addition to combat things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;like hate raids&lt;/a&gt;, where streamers’ chats are overrun with trolls sending hateful messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnqbPd"&gt;The new tool, called Suspicious User Detection, can identify users as “likely” or “possible” people who have evaded bans from a streamer’s channel. The machine learning model powering the tool identifies potential evaders by evaluating things such as their behavior and characteristics about their account and compares that information against accounts that have been banned from a streamer’s channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igfhpf"&gt;Messages from “likely” evaders won’t be sent to chat, but streamers and their mods can see them. Streamers and mods can choose to monitor a likely ban evader, which adds that user to a monitoring list and puts a message next to a user’s name noting the monitoring (as shown in the GIF below), or ban them. “Possible” evaders’ messages &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; appear in chat, but streamers / mods can opt to have those messages blocked from chat as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SN_bbBfuej_qF3jmpQ8Js_cam4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053645/Untitled.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HWio0w"&gt;Twitch says it will turn Suspicious User Detection on by default, but streamers can tweak or turn off the tool if they want. Streamers and mods can also manually select to monitor users of whom they are suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlEph8"&gt;“This tool was inspired in large part by community feedback around the need for better ways to curb ban evaders,” Alison Huffman, Twitch’s director of product for community health, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When we were speaking with mods about their pain points, we heard that it can be hard to distinguish whether a user who chatted something that violated their channel’s norms was a harmful, repeat harasser or just a newer viewer who hadn’t learned that channel’s customs yet. As such, we designed this tool to give mods and creators more information about potential ban evaders so they could make more efficient and informed decisions within their channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LFFRt"&gt;Suspicious User Detection seems like it could make a difference in silencing hateful individuals, especially if used in tandem with recently introduced controls that let a streamer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700937/twitch-safety-tools-verification-phone-hate-raids"&gt;require phone or email verification&lt;/a&gt; for accounts participating in chat. But it remains to be seen how effective Suspicious User Detection actually will be in practice or if ban evaders can find ways to get around the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Quest update brings cloud backups and a mixed reality view</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2QxlZZ4jT5mnM0Ph-ULYtnWttH4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211792/akrales_200904_4160_0158.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vA50ax"&gt;Meta has delivered a new batch of features for Quest headsets &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fmixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an update rolling out today&lt;/a&gt;. The changes include cloud backups, a mixed reality camera mode, and other settings that round out the Quest’s already impressive feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QhHtn"&gt;I’m most excited about the cloud backups feature, which gives you a way to restore user-specific data to your apps, including game saves and headset settings, if you need to replace, update, or reset your Quest. This is one of those things that I’m surprised the Quest didn’t support already, and I found out the hard way that it didn’t a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, I’m glad that it’s here now. It can be activated within the “Device” tab in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Quest mixed reality camera for Beat Saber" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FNeHizDsPGOHld4n_TnPN2CKSxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053421/mixedrealitycamera.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nilr6D"&gt;The mixed reality camera also seems really cool. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440683/oculus-v29-live-overlay-mixed-reality-capture-mic-files-app"&gt;Live Overlay feature that arrived in v29&lt;/a&gt; that imposed your body over a first-person view of a game or app, the new feature lets you see yourself interacting in the game world from a third-person perspective, as seen through your phone’s camera. The GIF provided by Meta that we’ve embedded shows what the end result can look like. You’ll be able to see yourself in &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for example,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;striking blocks and dodging obstacles. Meta says that a dozen apps support the feature, including &lt;em&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Superhot VR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Synth Riders&lt;/em&gt;, but a total of just six &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/mobile-mixed-reality-camera?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=mixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update"&gt;were listed at this page&lt;/a&gt; at the time of publishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5hu4J"&gt;To use the mobile mixed reality camera feature, you need an iPhone XS or newer, running iOS 11 or higher. Support for Android phones and tablets was erroneously included in Meta’s support page for the feature, but it has since been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDUm7c"&gt;The new software also changes where you’ll enable multiuser support, the feature that lets you add multiple Facebook accounts to the headset, and app sharing, which lets you share paid apps among those profiles. They were previously nested within the “experimental features” settings tab, but both are moving to the “Accounts” section of the settings menu. This new v35 software also lays the groundwork for using Messenger to make voice calls while you have the headset on, as well as adding new cosmetic items that can be used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt;, Meta’s take on a VR office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjx3JB"&gt;The last note in Meta’s blog on the latest Quest software is that it now has a public test channel for its upcoming software. &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/using-your-headset/quest-ptc?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=mixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update"&gt;You can sign up for it here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to test new features earlier than the rest of us — although Meta says that you won’t be able to leave it after you join until a new public software update is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QG8AMj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Will the Oculus Quest still require a Facebook account? It’s complicated ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751297/meta-oculus-quest-need-facebook-account-login-password"},{"title":"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is coming to Oculus Quest 2...at some point","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751009/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-oculus-quest-2"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PXIYGv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: Meta told The Verge that its list of devices that are compatible with its new mobile mixed reality camera feature, which included support for all Android tablets and phones, was incorrect, and has been updated. We’ve updated our post to reflect the changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These transparent Apple prototypes clearly show the greatness of see-through gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axwYftqTABRQUzQluiXTwk4WCUs=/0x168:4030x2855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211546/FE5CyAvWUAQBTe0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Giulio Zompetti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Flm7ya"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611234/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-working-prototype"&gt;Apple device collector Giulio Zompetti&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152"&gt;photographed a prototype 29W Apple charging brick&lt;/a&gt;, and it may be one of the rare instances where the product-in-progress may look better than the final version. What makes it special is that you can literally see Apple’s design process because of the clear plastic shell, unlike the retail version where the internals are hidden by opaque white plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ws2aIQ"&gt;Zompetti also tweeted another clear prototype, a pair of AirPods that live up to the “Air” name. The retro-futuristic look of the densely packed electronics makes me wish Apple would actually sell see-through gadgets again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9kxFUv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="da" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AirPods?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, translucent prototype earbuds &lt;a href="https://t.co/zE4dt47H0J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zE4dt47H0J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1465690029611749380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QGcrea"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;29W Apple Charger prototype. &lt;a href="https://t.co/h2ZoHCMw0F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/h2ZoHCMw0F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5WcHC"&gt;Transparent electronics were a (cool) fad in the 90s, with Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/12/20-macs-for-2020-1-imac-g3/"&gt;iMac G3&lt;/a&gt; often being brought up by those reminiscing about the age of transparent or translucent electronics, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/96k213/seethrough_electronics/"&gt;alongside the Nintendo 64&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/slackjaw/gizmodo-product-review-1987s-unisonic-clear-telephone-model-6900-e885927a43f3"&gt;Unisonic clear landline phone&lt;/a&gt;. But the look does seem to be having a sort of revival: you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy skins&lt;/a&gt; that make it look like you’ve done a transparent mod on your phone (without the risks that come with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEWO68Tegf8"&gt;scraping off the back panel’s paint or plastic&lt;/a&gt;), and companies like Nothing are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;releasing actually see-through gadgets&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not to mention the variety of after-market mods for consoles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Transparent-Replacement-Nintendo-Switch-Controller/dp/B08M3GK34W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; that let you replace the device’s opaque plastic with a case that shows off the internals. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Twn0c-dBoERdfppSqd1NX8_jGMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746960/DSCF4386_Edited.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing’s Ear 1s look a lot like the prototype AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0FxS8jOPIItIlAZE20E8IbrWIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053567/0ry14gzswhl71.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit user Odellot posted a massive collection of see-through gadgets, including a PS5 and DualSense controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q3sfhL"&gt;These days, it feels unlikely that Apple would actually sell whimsical clear devices — we can barely get colors on pro devices, and the Apple logo hasn’t started glowing again, despite the new MacBook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;including a refreshed design&lt;/a&gt;. But I can hope that Apple will return to its roots if transparent devices start coming back in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZx7oE"&gt;So come on, Apple; your engineers do impressive work, which you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tobL8U7dQo"&gt;love to show off in presentations&lt;/a&gt;. Why not let it see the light of day and make us feel like it’s the future again by giving us some transparent accessories? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQhy9O"&gt;If you love seeing the internals of Apple devices, Zompetti also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611234/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-working-prototype"&gt;posted pictures of an AirPower prototype&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, showing off some incredible circuitry. You can also check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18263844/apple-iphone-prototype-m68-original-development-board-red"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s story on the original iPhone prototype&lt;/a&gt;, which looked more like a breadboard electronics project than the pocketable device it would eventually become. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 101: How to stop location tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQvSX9yTWz03Njmtu8yvH0Vksnc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67293304/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJmXXh"&gt;Location tracking can be very handy — it’s convenient when an app can tell you, say, where the nearby restaurants or gas stations are — but &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/11/18136361/location-tracking-data-ad-targeting-facebook-google-amazon"&gt;it’s also a privacy issue&lt;/a&gt;. Do you want all your wanderings registered by Google? Are you comfortable knowing that Mark Zuckerberg’s minions know where you are at all times? (Well, not that Mark Zuckerberg has minions, but you know what I mean.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwPknj"&gt;In this article, we’ll take a look at how to stop location tracking on your Android phone (and your Google account) and how to delete your location history from your OS and from some of the more popular apps. As always, note that versions of Android can differ, and many manufacturers use overlays as well, which can change the locations of various commands — but they should be similar enough for you to be able to find your way. For these instructions, I’ve used a Pixel 6 phone running Android 12, but I’ve included some directions for those with earlier versions of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UdeiEL"&gt;Stop Google from tracking you, period.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GalrTP"&gt;You probably know that Google can track your location and movements through its Google Maps app. But you may not realize that your Android phone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684660/google-turn-off-location-history-data"&gt;also tracking your movements and activities&lt;/a&gt; through several other built-in apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSpFz7"&gt;If you really don’t want your phone to be tracking &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of your movements and activities, there is a way to turn tracking off for all (well, most) of them. You just need to be aware that you’re probably going to render many of your apps (such as ride-share apps, weather apps, and, of course, mapping apps) less usable — or in some cases, completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YQV4pE"&gt;Stop Google tracking using a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f1w8YB"&gt;First, we’re going to stop Google from saving your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D6SBL5"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://myactivity.google.com/"&gt;https://myactivity.google.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3tOjV"&gt;Under “My Google Activity” you’ll see the buttons for three types of activity: Web &amp;amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History. You can visit each individually by selecting the appropriate button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under “My Google Activity” you’ll see the buttons for three types of activity: Web &amp;amp;amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNlEIRVdlecEG9hYzOAPLrcWLJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050931/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_11.04.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under “My Google Activity” you’ll see the buttons for three types of activity: Web &amp;amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="2IMZKs"&gt;A more efficient way, though, may be to go to Activity Controls, found in the left-hand menu. This page will show you all three controls on the same page; in addition, you can control ad personalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s activity controls lets you turn off tracking." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDbZGFRqz3OJSGr82vH7VMLE43k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21814226/Screen_Shot_2020_08_25_at_10.20.43_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s activity controls let you turn off tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DTFGM5"&gt;“Web &amp;amp; App Activity” covers anything you’ve done on Google apps and services. You can turn tracking off completely, or choose to keep it on but stop it from saving your history or activity when you use your Chrome browser. You can also turn off “Include audio recordings,” which determines if all your audio interactions with Google and / or Google Assistant are saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NRGVRM"&gt;The other relevant category is, of course, “Location History,” which saves information about where you’ve gone with your device. Also, look for “Devices on this account” and click the down icon to the right; you’ll get a list of all the devices that you have that are currently following your location — since that may include old phones that you are no longer using, this is a good thing to check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h9JK7M"&gt;We might as well mention that you can also disable your “YouTube History,” which includes both your search and watch history, and “Ad personalization,” which uses your history to choose which ads you’ll see. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SU1Gqk"&gt;Okay — you’ve now prevented any more data from being gathered. But you may want to delete all or some of the information that’s already been collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3nver"&gt;Go back to the My Activity page and click on “Delete activity by” in the left-hand menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZWp9Lb"&gt;You’ll get a pop-up window that lets you delete your activity based on time period: the last hour, last day, “All time” (in other words, all dates), or “Custom range” for a specific date range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pop-up window that lets you delete your activity based on time period." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jq021IJ2xWeWo6x7ZTatZDVWECI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812433/Screen_Shot_2020_08_24_at_1.52.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pop-up window lets you delete your activity based on time period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="30VGHh"&gt;If you choose “Custom range,” you’ll be able to choose a date range. If you choose “All time,” you can then filter that info depending on services (such as ads, Chrome, Google Play Store, etc.). When you’re ready, click on “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="you can then filter that info depending on services" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0P0QV7y8a4U1yezCpuyKaBmGN28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812435/Screen_Shot_2020_08_24_at_1.55.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can filter your info depending on services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="j0CjyY"&gt;You’ll then get a preview of some of the activities that will be deleted. If you’re okay with that, select “Delete.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The last step before you delete your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42gj2sstwsFo74UtupkqSE-pmfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812436/Screen_Shot_2020_08_24_at_1.58.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last step before you delete your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OqvN1p"&gt;Incidentally, if you want to make sure that nobody but you can delete your histories, then select the “Manage activity” link under each category in Activity Controls, and look for “Manage My Activity verification.” If you enable that feature, Google will ask for a password any time you want to look at or delete any history in your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmJxHR"&gt;And if you don’t want to worry about manually deleting your stuff, you can enable auto-delete in each category (you’ll see the option within each category on the Activity Controls page). You’ll have the option to automatically delete your activity after either three, 18, or 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can now auto-delete your location history." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9k7GSAsreCH44MblC3mRkvwkLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050934/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_10.28.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now auto-delete your location history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uRpyvh"&gt;Stop Google tracking on an Android device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GqXlTf"&gt;Go to Settings. In the search box on top, type in “Activity controls” and tap it when it comes up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Succvo"&gt;If you have more than one Google account, select the one you want to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lGECdO"&gt;Here, as with the browser version, you can turn off or pause the monitoring of various activities, including setting auto-delete and managing a timeline of your activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android’s Activity Controls are very similar to those on the web." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgC86j9JJjEa-rXcqI_BEBkTmN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051107/Screenshot_20211129_163820.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android’s Activity Controls are very similar to those on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can select an auto-delete option on your mobile device." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq_CGGD4MYtzg7AuqSl_Wl0ASeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051106/Screenshot_20211129_163903.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can select an auto-delete option on your mobile device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QT0IEK"&gt;Turn location tracking on and off from the Quick Settings tray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kFm7jD"&gt;If you want to be able to turn location tracking on or off as you need it, you can do that, too. One way to arrange this is to use the Quick Settings tray (which is what you see when you swipe down from the top of your screen). The tray holds a variety of icons for the most often-used Android features; there is a “Location” icon that lets you toggle the location feature on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MqqXCq"&gt;Swipe down from the top of the screen. If you’re using Android 12, you’ll see a series of bubbles for things like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, flashlight, etc. If you’re using Android 11 or earlier, it will be a line of icons. Either way, that’s your Quick Settings tray. Look for the Location icon (usually, it looks like an upside-down drop of water).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HfSvBy"&gt;Not there? With Android 12, swipe across to see more bubbles; otherwise, swipe down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HMusT1"&gt;Still missing? Look for a pencil icon; on a Pixel, it will be on the bottom of the tray, but some Android interfaces will have it on top. Tap on the pencil, and the menu will open further. You can now see all the icons that are available. What you want to do is make sure the Location icon is in the easily visible part of the tray.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zyNck0"&gt;If your Location icon is in the bottom section, hold and drag it up to the visible group. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hpM8ic"&gt;You’ll now be able to quickly swipe down from the top of your screen and toggle Location on and off — for example, if you want to use Google Maps for directions, you can toggle Location on, and then turn it back off when you’re finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is a location button in your Quick Settings tray." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCw6_zZiFhaZIBoX6w6UaEa9HFo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052522/Screenshot_20211130_101011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a location button in your Quick Settings tray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is a location button in your Quick Settings tray." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q14K5sNVhsY9dS9mKfI3taztNxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052611/Screenshot_20211130_101104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the Location button isn’t immediately visible, you can move it up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nfbCQv"&gt;Stop location tracking on Android devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BTiLgC"&gt;If you don’t feel the need to block Google from recording all your activities, and simply want to stop the phone from recording your location, it’s easy to do — as long as you pay attention to the details: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="24De6B"&gt;Swipe down from the top of the screen so that you see your Quick Settings menu, and long-press on the Location icon — or swipe down, tap the Settings icon, and choose “Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="K0POTW"&gt;You’re now on the Location page. Find the “Use location” feature at the top and toggle it off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="7zmSu5"&gt;You’d think that would be it, wouldn’t you? But you’d be wrong. What is meant by “Use location” in Android depends on which sensors are following the location of the device: besides GPS, it could be Wi-Fi, mobile networks, or other sensors. So before you leave this page, look a little further down. If you’re using Android 12, look for the “Location services” button, otherwise, look for the “Advanced” button and tap on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LduQzU"&gt;Either way, you’ll have several categories that you can toggle on or off. These can be (depending on your Android version and your phone’s manufacturer):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HMhTYc"&gt;Google Emergency Location Service. This tells emergency services where you are if there’s a problem; for example, if your car goes off the road and the ambulance needs to find you. You can turn this off if you want, but read the fine print: “If ELS is off, your mobile carrier may still send device location during an emergency call.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FztpjJ"&gt;Google Location Accuracy. This uses Wi-Fi and other services to help pinpoint your location. If you want to turn off “Use location,” you need to make sure this is turned off as well. Any app that requires “precise location” (which I’ll explain in a bit) needs this to be turned on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dQUN9h"&gt;Google Location History. This leads you to a page where you can pause your device’s collection of your location history. That doesn’t get rid of what’s already been saved; there are instructions for that a little later in this article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6E3UDZ"&gt;Google Location Sharing. If you’re sharing your location with family members or friends, you can manage it here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FEv8CX"&gt;Wi-Fi scanning. This lets apps and services scan for local Wi-Fi networks, even if you have Wi-Fi turned off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KxgYO1"&gt;Bluetooth scanning. This lets apps and services search for Bluetooth devices even if Bluetooth is off. Both this and the Wi-Fi scanning are meant to improve location features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qS3jgn"&gt;If you can’t see these last two, go back to the Location page and look for a “Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning” link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On your Location page, select “Location services” to see additional options." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUlNPH2J5KSGG6p3NiM7zW0RuoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052614/Screenshot_20211130_101459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On your Location page, select “Location services” to see additional options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to keep your Emergency Location Service turned on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naiG39fl5_Ss_z6VdxcWcqBG0qI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052618/Screenshot_20211130_105535.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to keep your Emergency Location Service turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E6Jyki"&gt;Disable location tracking for any specific app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ne4HS1"&gt;You can find out which apps actually use location tracking and just disable it for those that you feel don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WfhZdM"&gt;Go to the Location page (by long-pressing the Location icon in your Quick Settings tray).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TVeNKM"&gt;Tap on “App permission” (or, if you’re using Android 12, look for “App location permissions”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xwz29M"&gt;You’ll find here a list of all your current apps that have permission to access your location either all of the time or only while in use. Tap on any to change the permission to either allow all of the time, allow only while in use, ask every time, or deny. You can also decide whether the app will be allowed to use “precise location” — in other words, use more than GPS to determine where you are. For that, “Google Location Accuracy,” also found on the Location page. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aMt7Eg"&gt;Sometimes when you turn off permissions in the Android Settings, the app itself will continually try to get you to restore that permission. It’s irritating, but unless the app lets you say, “No, leave me alone,” you will either have to live with it or get a different app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="App permissions classifies apps by which permissions you allow them to have." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qz9bV240OL92S3XVji3UOy41PGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052672/Screenshot_20211130_105745.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;App permissions classify apps by which permissions you allow them to have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you click on a specific app, you can change its permission level." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5ZalaYnEfjpO1-BTLUnVLm7X6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052671/Screenshot_20211130_105817.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you click on a specific app, you can change its permission level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oGKkfA"&gt;Delete your location history &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wya7YG"&gt;While you can turn off location tracking from your Android phone’s settings, once a service has collected your location info, getting rid of that history takes a little work. If you want to delete your location history, the first place you need to go is Google; after that, apps that collect this information include Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fRiTfT"&gt;Delete your Google location history on Android&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BKWerC"&gt;While you can delete location history collected for your Google timeline in the My Activity area (see above), you can also get rid of it easily in Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QWW2ri"&gt;Go to your Google Maps app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uMSfwi"&gt;Tap on your profile icon in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BfjCrt"&gt;Tap on “Your Timeline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6D8Bzs"&gt;Select the three dots in the upper right corner. Tap on “Settings and Privacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sZesK5"&gt;Scroll down to “Delete all Location History.” You’ll get a pop-up window that asks you to check a box saying that you understand that some of your apps may not work properly. Check the box and select “Delete.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e0XnVK"&gt;You also have the option of deleting your location history within a date range or setting the app to automatically delete your location history after three, 18, or 36 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can delete your entire location history, or just within a range of dates." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNPVWgx823woqApz5f2bCsk2ThE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052750/Screenshot_20211130_112946.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can delete your entire location history or just within a range of dates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google will always give you a last chance to back out." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaUOJcg2CvdBScqvHXRKb0xdaPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052751/Screenshot_20211130_113018.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google will always give you a last chance to back out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7EXzk4"&gt;Delete your Google location history on a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ArwYdf"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps"&gt;https://www.google.com/maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="02JrgK"&gt;Tap on the three parallel lines in the upper left corner of the side panel. (If you don’t see the panel, look for the small arrow in the upper left corner and click on it.) Select “Your timeline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q6duPL"&gt;Look for the gear icon on the lower right side of the screen. Click on it, and then on “Delete all Location History.” You can also set the automatic deletion feature here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look for the gear in your Timeline to delete your location history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IZyBXY"&gt;As with the mobile app, you’ll get a pop-up window that asks you to check a box saying that you understand that some of your apps may not work properly. Check the box and select “Delete Location History.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll be asked to confirm the history deletion." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_Q7xlG3ScisGSNfYOEp8FjYGpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21817537/Screen_Shot_2020_08_25_at_11.47.35_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be asked to confirm the history deletion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3CJS3B"&gt;Delete your location history on Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgk6ti"&gt;Facebook does keep a separate history of your locations, and if you want to delete that history, you can do it through the mobile app or the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ponAKZ"&gt;Using the Android app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6DV6yB"&gt;In the Facebook app, tap the hamburger (three parallel lines) in the top right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V4BsHY"&gt;Scroll down and tap on “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wglR5O"&gt;Tap on “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S1YOS1"&gt;Scroll down and tap on “Location” (which is under the “Permissions” subhead). This will take you to the “Location Services” page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H4uVRV"&gt;You can now choose to let Facebook access your phone’s location all the time, while using the app, or never.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fJBfmO"&gt;If you want to allow Facebook to save a history of your locations (or stop it from doing so), tap on “Location History” to toggle it on or off. It’s here that you can also delete your existing location history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Facebook “Settings &amp;amp;amp; Privacy,” select “Settings.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J05QA-fV2ySpCTSIBHzX4FUCRhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052787/Screenshot_20211130_114043.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Facebook “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy,” select “Settings.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Location Services lets you choose when Facebook can receive your location data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajk0meV4TUbCfngk5LLMzA88VKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052789/Screenshot_20211130_114144.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vD2Zs7"&gt;Using a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5bn7Gs"&gt;In Facebook, click on the small arrow next to the Notifications icon in the upper right corner. Click on “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy Shortcuts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TUXU0S"&gt;Click on “Manage your location settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Manage your location settings” under the “Privacy” category." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-4akw7Qpe5wAeRvIfaWjpybO9cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21817831/Screen_Shot_2020_08_25_at_1.33.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Manage your location settings” under the “Privacy” category.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="5rSFOb"&gt;On the “Location Settings” page, click on the “View your Location History” button. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Location Settings” page lets you view your history, delete it, and stop recording it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AUu8Y6MojArdJOPaI1fXobzRfkU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21817832/Screen_Shot_2020_08_25_at_1.33.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Location Settings” page lets you view your history, delete it, and stop recording it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1voyie"&gt;Then click on the gear in the upper left corner. As with the mobile app, you can now either delete that specific day or delete your entire location history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can delete that day’s history, or all your history." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaaTWVuYyd9ErXf1lwPHNlBtVb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052812/Screen_Shot_2021_11_30_at_11.47.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can delete that day’s history or all your history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="z4F61t"&gt;On the “Location Settings” page, you can also turn your location history on or off for your mobile devices. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qthun7"&gt;Delete your location history on Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ynv6F"&gt;Twitter makes it relatively simple to turn off its location tracking within the Android app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MTvo6j"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper left of the homescreen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S8MLg3"&gt;Tap on “Settings and privacy.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9LBQi7"&gt;Tap on “Privacy and safety.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dK7CAC"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Location information” and tap on it. You can then toggle off the boxes that give Twitter permission to collect your GPS and other location information. And don’t forget to tap on “Explore settings,” which gives Twitter the option to show nearby content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down until you see “Location information.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are two location settings to toggle off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8IAf7gasnRYo-2Qcfl0x4e5qkX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053311/Screenshot_20211130_135355.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are two location settings to toggle off here, and one to tap on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MT5aQx"&gt;You can delete your Twitter location history as well, but only from your browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lD5KYj"&gt;Go to your Twitter account, click on “More” in the left column and on “Settings and privacy.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oJT1AX"&gt;In the left-hand menu, click on “Privacy and safety.” Scroll down and select “Location information.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOdlntqls69V-ZKCuVoHi8RQL74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053137/Screen_Shot_2021_11_30_at_1.24.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="cZqE4H"&gt;Uncheck “Personalize based on places you’ve been.” Then click on “Add location information to your Tweets.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c0t3UL"&gt;Uncheck “Add location information to your Tweets.” Then click on “Delete all location information.” And if it asks: yes, you are sure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Red Notice was able to beat Bird Box as Netflix’s biggest movie debut ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlXLyR8oBQH1ANOqMcImuiqyxbU=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211481/RN_20200303_16805r6a.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Frank Masi/Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dterW4"&gt;Netflix’s heist drama &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; has officially overthrown &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; as the streaming service’s biggest movie debut to date, with over 328 million total hours viewed as of today. That beats out &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt;’s prior record — 282 million hours in its first 28 days — by a good margin, and &lt;em&gt;Red Notice &lt;/em&gt;still has ample time to expand its debut-month record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zfq1Kn"&gt;That might seem like great news for Netflix: a movie it wanted to be a huge hit was in fact a huge hit. It commanded views up against an eight-hour Beatles documentary as well as big theatrical releases like a &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; spinoff and multiple titles from Disney. But the film’s success isn’t quite as remarkable as the numbers make it appear. Sure, the hours viewed figure indicates that subscribers are actually watching &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s also the kind of numbers Netflix &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be netting right now and should probably be seeing more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZizQI"&gt;As far as celebrity appeal goes, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; checks a lot of boxes — it stars Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), and The Rock (Dwayne Johnson), all of whom more or less play themselves — and had a huge $200 million budget to back it all up. But the film hasn’t achieved anywhere near the cultural cachet of &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; or Netflix’s more recent success &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, which remains its most popular TV series debut to date. To say that&lt;em&gt; Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; lacked the substance of either of the aforementioned titles would frankly be generous. &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; has some big-boom action fun, but that’s about as far as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPoYbl"&gt;So how on earth did a movie that by many accounts is just, well, &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; eclipse &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; for Netflix’s most-viewed film to date? One answer might be subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZcrRv"&gt;The problem with comparing two films that debuted on Netflix roughly three years apart — aside from their markedly different tones and inverse genres — is that Netflix has grown substantially in that time. When Netflix shared its fourth-quarter earnings in January 2019, a month after &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt;’s premiere, the company reported having around &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/17/media/netflix-earnings-q4/index.html"&gt;139 million subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. As of its most recently reported subscription figures, it now has around &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-q3-2021-earnings-1235033272/"&gt;214 million active accounts&lt;/a&gt; — and that’s after the service twice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;raised its prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;axed its free trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojohqm"&gt;Netflix is now reaching more people globally than at any other time in its history, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787426/netflix-cdn-open-connect"&gt;custom-tailors its product&lt;/a&gt; to its various markets across the world. (As of this week’s data, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; remained in the top 10 films in 94 countries.) That means that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; film that the streamer puts on its service now is better positioned to do well over titles that premiered when it had some 75 million fewer active accounts, fewer features, and the world wasn’t living through an ongoing global health crisis that sees many of us turning to streaming services to keep us preoccupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQC4S5"&gt;It’s likely that &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; will continue to topple records during its first 28 days on the service, the window for which Netflix reports the total viewing hours of its most popular titles. It’s almost assured, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02CZIp"&gt;But streaming data doesn’t and arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611516/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-streaming-services-transparency"&gt;can’t give a full picture&lt;/a&gt; of success because of how rapidly the space is evolving, for several reasons. Netflix is among the most transparent streaming services, offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785623/netflix-launches-top-10-titles-website"&gt;publicly accessible&lt;/a&gt; and frequently updated dedicated hub for tracking its hits, but even that can be tricky when its past successes are measured against newer ones as the service continues to grow. (Its newer public-facing metric, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;hours viewed&lt;/a&gt;, is to Netflix’s credit far easier to interpret than its former maligned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;two-minute viewing metric&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oLMQq"&gt;But even more to that point, without data shared by other services, we’re still left in the dark about how Netflix’s successes compare to those of, for example, HBO Max or Prime Video. In an ideal scenario, all of these services would adopt greater transparency and convene around one single way of gauging success. Those numbers should then account for the debut of the title against the growth of the service over time. (This week, for example, the Halle Berry-starring drama &lt;em&gt;Bruised —&lt;/em&gt; which also premiered this month — came in second for English-language films with 47.7 million hours viewed to &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;’s 50.6 million during the same weeklong period. That context is helpful for understanding &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;’s success.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyDrLw"&gt;Immediately, those asks seem like a tall order from companies that have been intentionally obtuse about &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/those-hbo-max-numbers-arent-what-they-seem-1846752112"&gt;accurately representing their data&lt;/a&gt; in the past. We’re getting this data from Netflix and in a way that most people can reasonably understand — and that’s great. But because of the rapidly evolving nature of the streaming wars, these numbers are harder to interpret than, say, box office sales. And without everyone playing by the same rules, the data is pretty meaningless for giving us any comparative understanding of how Netflix stacks up against the competition — and what truly makes a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Levels Health review: optimize your fitness with a $400 glucose tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bgv3bDWKDTi93bUQawIf5tf110=/0x333:4000x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210526/20211026_132108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key to the Levels Health system is a device that constantly monitors glucose levels in your bloodstream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Real-time glucose tracking for fitness-based purposes is here, but it’ll cost you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Eqexk9"&gt;“What is that thing on your shoulder?” has been the question I’ve been asked most frequently for the last month. Understandably so. For the last 30 days, just barely peeking out from under the sleeve of my T-shirts, there has been a big black sticker. It’s round, about two inches in diameter, and it looks like a high-end Band-Aid. But that sticker is just a cover. Under it is a smaller plastic disk, with a little thread that is actually sticking into my body and analyzing my ever-changing blood-sugar levels. It’s the closest I’ve ever been to cyborg status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHsWK0"&gt;Levels Health is a new product and service — currently in late-stage beta but gettable by the public — designed to monitor your body’s glucose response to different stimuli, like exercise and stress and especially the foods you eat. It’s sort of like a Fitbit for your metabolic health, and it currently costs a hefty $400 for the one-month program. It’s aimed toward athletes and the health-conscious who are looking for everything from optimum performance to simply staying healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63u9hx"&gt;Glucose monitoring devices like these are traditionally used by diabetics, who need to know their blood sugar levels and when to administer insulin or treat for low blood sugar. But Levels is marketing itself as a wellness product for anyone to use and isn’t making any diagnostic claims. “Levels is currently a general health and wellness program not intended to diagnose, manage, or treat any health conditions,” says Dr. Casey Means, the company’s co-founder and chief medical officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrNsTr"&gt;But let’s back up a little and talk about glucose itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvGNTO"&gt;You might think of glucose as the primary building block for energy inside your body. Your digestive process breaks down the foods you eat (especially the carbohydrates, but fats and proteins, too) and converts much of it into glucose, which it puts into your bloodstream. When that happens, your pancreas gets a signal to release insulin, which is a hormone that allows the cells in your body to take up the glucose and use it as energy (every cell in your body uses glucose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4D2p7"&gt;The problem is that there can be too much of a good thing. When there’s too much glucose in your blood, it sort of overwhelms your system. Your muscles can’t take it all up, and bad things start to happen. It may get stored in fat cells as triglycerides. It may damage your liver, brain, and other systems. Big doses of glucose can also cause your pancreas to make too much insulin, which can lead to something known as “insulin resistance,” where your cells start ignoring the insulin and take up less and less glucose over time, which means more and more glucose stays in your blood. This can lead to a whole host of medical problems, including type-2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and potentially things like cancer, Alzheimer’s, reproductive issues, fatigue, brain fog, and much more. According to &lt;a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2018/11/28/only-12-percent-of-american-adults-are-metabolically-healthy-carolina-study-finds/"&gt;a 2018 study from UNC at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, only about 12 percent of Americans are metabolically healthy, which is a frighteningly low number.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mc1tFkFAWLjcA67j3-M506pGVIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23032252/20211026_142234.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glucose monitor has a probe that inserts into your arm. It’s surprisingly painless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmxyRE"&gt;This is all a fairly high-level breakdown. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty, Levels wrote what it calls its &lt;a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-metabolic-fitness"&gt;Ultimate Guide to Metabolic Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fascinating read and goes into more detail than I can here. The TL;DR version is this: High spikes in your glucose levels are bad, but every body is different, and there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution that works for humans. What causes a spike in me may not cause a spike in you. We may all respond differently to the same exact foods, exercise, or sleep routines, and while some rules of thumb may hold somewhat constant, the only way to know for sure is to experiment and track the results, which finally brings us back to the thingy on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofvLJ5"&gt;The disk that’s stuck to me is a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). These products themselves aren’t super new, and Levels doesn’t actually make this one. Instead, it works with a product called the &lt;a href="https://www.freestyle.abbott/us-en/home.html"&gt;Freestyle Libre&lt;/a&gt;, made by Abbott. The gadget accounts for much of the cost of the Levels program. Each one lasts for 14 days, so you have to swap them halfway through. The disk-shaped sensor comes embedded in a larger, round plastic stamp. You try to find an out-of-the-way spot on the back of your arm, ideally in the little pocket between your triceps and deltoid, and you clean the area with an included alcohol pad. Then, you put the stamp on your arm and depress it until you hear a loud click. In that click, the device actually sticks you with a little pin, which is instantly withdrawn and replaced with a little, flexible, quarter-inch thread, which is about the thickness of a single bristle on a hairbrush. Levels promises that it’s completely painless, and indeed it was. I literally could not feel it at all, either during or after.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A plastic tool is used to mount the monitor to your arm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XzlJvs"&gt;Once you remove the plastic stamp, you’ve got this little white disk stuck to you. You slap the larger, black adhesive circle over it just to give it some added protection, and you’re good to go. It’s completely sweat-proof and waterproof (I ran, swam, surfed with it and never had any issues), and you’ll largely forget it’s there at all. The sensor logs a sample every minute and transfers all of the data over to your phone when you scan it. To do that, you simply touch the back of your phone to the sensor. It has an NFC radio, and it transfers all of the data points collected since your last scan over to the Levels app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Stim"&gt;That app is where you spend most of your time. That’s where you log all of your food and exercise. You simply write in what you ate and when you ate it, or you can take a photo of it if that’s easier. You don’t need to be too specific (i.e., you’re not counting calories, ingredients, or macros); you just enter in enough information so you remember what you had. You can also log events like meditation, sex, or moments of acute stress. Whatever you want, really — you can see how your body responds. Levels recommends you keep your glucose levels between 70 and 110 mg/dL. The ADA says you can go up to 140 mg/dL, but once you cross the 140 line, you’re classified as “pre-diabetic,” so Levels wants you to stay well clear of that and in the “optimal” zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqfVO3"&gt;The name of the game is avoiding glucose spikes and dips. The app shows you a graph of all your data points, and you want to see a nice, smooth curve after meals. Levels also rates each logged item from zero to 10 (with 10 being the best), so you can easily interpret your results. I logged nearly everything I ate and every minute of exercise for a month, and I was genuinely surprised by the way my body responded to certain things. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Levels app tells you exactly how each meal or activity impacted your glucose levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I8PdTX"&gt;For instance, there’s this one protein bar that I’ve been eating for years that is high-protein and low carbohydrate, etc. I was shocked that it made my glucose spike aggressively. Levels gave it a 2. It turns out that my body doesn’t mind some sugar alcohols, but other types of sugar alcohols cause a strong reaction. Thankfully, my regular breakfast of eggs with salad and coffee came in at a 10, but if I added a bowl of oatmeal to it, my score dropped down to a 3. Chicken tenders were fine with a savory barbecue sauce, but if I switched to my favorite (a sweet one), it dropped all the way down to a 0. Damn. Potatoes seemed to be one of the worst offenders for causing me spikes, which was heartbreaking, but sweet potato fries were less bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6AzyX"&gt;One of the biggest takeaways for me was how I could mitigate the negative impact of one thing by adding something else. For example, instead of eating that protein bar that gave me a 2 by itself, if I ate it with some jerky and almonds, it got upgraded to a 6. Dinner would frequently cause me to spike, but dinner with a walk immediately afterward improved my numbers significantly because my muscles used up some of that excess glucose in my blood. A cocktail then going to bed was bad, but a cocktail then going to bed with someone else… not so bad! You’re also given a score for each day and week as a whole, from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vuQuhq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Being active after a meal often mitigated the spike in glucose levels from the food&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VokyP0"&gt;Levels suggests you don’t make any changes during the first week, so you can see what happens with your normal habits. For weeks two and three, they suggest you start experimenting with different foods to see how your body responds to different things. For week four, it’s recommended that you try to implement your learnings and go for the lowest score possible. Everything you log takes about two hours before you can see your score (because your body doesn’t respond to food or exercise immediately), but then you can see everything in the app. Levels also emails you daily and weekly reports and, finally, one big report at the end of your one-month journey that has 14 pages of granular info broken down into easy-to-understand charts and graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WapVTK"&gt;While the device itself doesn’t hurt at all, it must be said that there are some pain points. For starters, Levels is currently using a two-app solution. You have to download the sensor’s app (called LibreLink) and set up an account on it; then, you tell that app to share info with the Levels app. Once everything is set up and linked, you don’t really need to deal with LibreLink again, but Levels acknowledges that the onboarding process isn’t ideal, and it’s working on a better solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2KZ6D"&gt;A larger issue is that the sensor itself can only store eight hours’ worth of data points. That means that if you don’t remember to scan it right before you go to bed and again right when you wake up, then you’ll have some gaps in your data. Not ideal, especially if you’re one of those lucky people who actually gets eight-plus hours of sleep (tell me what it’s like?). Levels is working on compatibility with another continuous glucose monitor that has Bluetooth so it could constantly push updates to your phone in the background, but no word yet on if or when that option will be available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wLDyxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The sensor can only hold eight hours worth of data, so you have to remember to sync it often with the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYNJv3"&gt;Levels could go further in clarifying what your numbers mean, especially toward the beginning. Right now, the way the app is set up, you don’t get a ton of information or advice to go along with your data. The company has written a lot of blogs that help explain the ins and outs of the science behind this, but it would be nice if it were better integrated into the app and if there was more built-in coaching as you went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDAHZT"&gt;Lastly, there’s the price. $400 for a month is steep. For that, you could buy a very solid multisport watch with GPS (or an Apple Watch) that would last you for years and track a ton of different metrics and activities. Of course, the data you get from Levels is unique in the pantheon of fitness trackers, but it would be easier to take the leap if the cost wasn’t so exorbitant. Its price certainly supports the argument that fitness tech really &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785163/digital-health-physical-activity-inequity"&gt;only benefits the wealthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNMDTv"&gt;Ultimately, I enjoyed my experience with Levels, and I can see it being a useful tool for athletes who want to learn how to fuel properly for their unique body chemistry and for people who have concerns about their metabolic fitness. I didn’t lose any weight in the month I did it, but that’s because glucose levels are just one part of the picture. Levels works with Apple Health and Google Fit to automatically import activities, but part of me thought it would be nice if it could integrate with a calorie tracking system like MyFitnessPal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTgqNL"&gt;After some thought, though, I came around to believe that it might be best to take a month to simply learn how your body responds to different foods and activities and then integrate those learnings into your diet and exercise plan going forward. That’s something I’m already doing in the days since I took the tracker off. Where I used to just snack on an apple, now I’m more likely to pair it with some yogurt or cheese because I know it won’t spike my glucose as much, which will be better for my long-term health and may help prevent an energy crash a few hours later. That really is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HabFgC"&gt;Levels is targeting a full launch sometime in 2022. It’s currently in a semi-closed beta, and it has more than 100,000 people on the waiting list, but if you use &lt;a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/join?partner=THEVERGE"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, you should be able to skip the line, and most people will get their tracker kit within two weeks of ordering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qRrxV4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 3:50PM ET November 30th, 2021: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;After this review was published, Levels reached out to say that it is now planning its full launch in 2022 instead of by the end of this year, though it doesn’t have a more precise time frame than that. We’ve updated the article to reflect this information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
