    <title>Caterpillar is bringing its newest rugged phone to the US for $699</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ohv_sJx9yqXWNzAhpUUVI6kRuXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059447/cat_s62_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An integrated thermal imaging camera is a central feature on the S62.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mI8RHq"&gt;The Cat S62 Pro — and that’s Cat as in Caterpillar, the construction company — is now available in the US. The rugged smartphone is the latest device to feature Cat branding (it’s technically a product of licensee Bullitt Group) and builds on its predecessors’ integrated thermal camera capabilities. It’s designed with construction and industrial workers in mind,  and at $699, it’s a more attractively priced follow up to 2018’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/22/17039758/thermal-camera-caterpillar-s61-update-s60-smartphone-android-price"&gt;S61&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted in the US at $899.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tQ7qG"&gt;Introduced last summer for sale in the UK, the S62 Pro features solid (if not super competitive) phone specs, which isn’t guaranteed in the rugged phone class. You’ll get a 5.7-inch 1080p display, a Snapdragon 660 processor with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,000mAh battery. But unlike mainstream midrange devices launching now, you won’t get 5G connectivity or Android 11 pre-installed; it ships with Android 10 and Cat says it will provide an update to 11. While the S62 Pro is significantly less expensive than its predecessor, it no longer offers the air quality and distance measurement sensors, and uses a slightly smaller battery (compared to 4,500mAh).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cat Phones S62 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9w7SZ13qLHkZKeaeDZSIFj2S2M0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411956/cat_s62_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1f4rhd"&gt;That’s the boring stuff. The exciting bits that the S62 Pro has to offer include its marquee feature: a built-in Flir thermal imaging camera with four times as many thermal pixels as its predecessor. The phone offers new modes that allow users to adjust and blend overlaid information from the standard 12-megapixel camera, providing more context to the thermal image. There’s also an option to set an alarm that will notify you when a certain temperature level is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Lgww6"&gt;As for its rugged credentials, the S62 Pro is rated at IP68 and IP69: the first indicates that it’s safe to submerge in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, the second that it can withstand high pressure spray. The company says it’s been tested against even harsher conditions than this, but is warrantied to the level of those official IP ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9UdOXrH33qslNvSdecVI7V2Jm4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411957/cat_s62_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Cat Phones&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S62 is built to withstand harsh work environments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQnKfY"&gt;It can withstand drops of up to six feet onto a steel surface, and its Gorilla Glass 6 screen is bolstered by an additional factory-fitted screen protector. The S62 Pro also meets requirements of the MIL-STD-810 military standard, including vibration and thermal shock resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCjmVl"&gt;The S62 Pro isn’t currently available through any of the major US carriers, but is being offered unlocked &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.catphones.com%2Fen-us%2Fcat-s62-pro-smartphone%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22360767%2Fcaterpillar-s62-pro-us-availability-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Cat phones&lt;/a&gt; and third parties including Amazon and Home Depot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former NASA chief Jim Bridenstine joins satellite internet firm Viasat’s board</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine Testifies Before Senate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FUV6tLc5r4luY71Fwi0oDLQkBeg=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059456/1228805110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJF1i"&gt;Former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine is joining space-based broadband firm Viasat’s board of directors as his latest post-NASA gig, after joining a space-focused private equity firm in January. Wading into the world of satellite internet, he says he’s concerned about the digital divide and the future of humanity, and he wants to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6NgmL"&gt;“When I left NASA I had a lot of different phone calls and texts on what I should be doing next or what I could be doing next,” Bridenstine tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. A mentor, he said, suggested he reach out to companies he’s interested in, so he emailed Viasat’s cofounder and executive chairman Mark Dankberg and asked if they need any help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vf0F10"&gt;“There’s a digital divide and we need to close that,” the former Congressman and NASA chief said, adding that he thinks Viasat’s approach of beaming internet from long-distance orbits with massive, high-throughput satellites is the right plan. He said he was also attracted by the company’s goal of cutting internet costs — almost invoking a mantra similar to the one he repeated non-stop at NASA about cutting costs of astronaut rides to space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNmu6J"&gt;“I mean, ultimately, if we want more of the world to be connected, we have to drive down the costs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WBWYu7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“...If we want more of the world to be connected, we have to drive down the costs.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8iwMI9"&gt;Southern California-based Viasat, a longtime provider of internet from space, plans to launch its technologically complex but long-delayed trio of internet satellites, called ViaSat-3, in roughly six-month intervals beginning in the first quarter of 2022. From super high orbits, those three satellites will shower the world with broadband internet at a throughput capacity of one terabyte per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEp1tM"&gt;Smaller satellites in lower orbits, and in larger swarms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22350643/oneweb-spacex-racing-broadband-internet-arctic-military"&gt;are all the rage&lt;/a&gt; in satellite broadband these days, where the their proximity to Earth reduces the time it takes for internet signals to beam into homes and businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink&lt;/a&gt; constellation is growing rapidly, with over 1,300 satellites launched to space since 2019. Jeff Bezos’s Amazon is planning its own constellation called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;Project Kuiper&lt;/a&gt;. Both constellations are multi-billion-dollar undertakings, an investment that has sent other companies into bankruptcy. Viasat also has plans to send 300 internet satellites into low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCYrNu"&gt;For Viasat, bringing Bridenstine on board will help the company get an edge in “space systems and network technology globally,” Dankberg said in a statement, adding that “Jim is also an ardent proponent of preserving safe access to space via proactive measures to protect the space environment and contain orbital debris.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXlbBZ"&gt;Bridenstine wasn’t sure how demanding the new job will be, but he’ll partake in Viasat’s quarterly board of director meetings and possibly its annual shareholder meetings. “But if there are other areas where I can either fill gaps or provide support during the course of the year, I have no doubt that Viasat will probably be giving me a call,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFaed0"&gt;Less than a week after leaving office on January 20th, when President Biden was sworn in, Bridenstine joined aerospace and defense private equity firm Acorn Growth Companies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple forced to offer Russian iPhone users local apps at setup thanks to new law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZkFJaQkba3BLqSfK6QLRtsj_sw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059430/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eRTAWg"&gt;iPhones purchased in Russia now show a list of Russian-made apps at startup, thanks to a new law which comes into effect today, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-setup-russia-government-approved-apps/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The prompt is part of the standard iPhone setup process, appearing after the user has selected other options like whether to allow Location Services or App Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FC5mg"&gt;“In compliance with Russian legal requirements, continue to view available apps to download,” the dry text reads, before showing a short list of just shy of a dozen apps. These include various Yandex apps, an email app from Mail.ru, a video live streaming service called OK Live, and popular Russian social network VK. A “Get” icon appears next to each app, giving the user a shortcut to install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="du1KVB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is how it looks in the actual setup. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QOUwwIGSnx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QOUwwIGSnx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Khaos Tian (@KhaosT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KhaosT/status/1377476353633624070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rUaQhd"&gt;The prompt comes in response to a Russian law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;originally passed back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; requiring manufacturers to pre-install Russian-made software on devices sold in the country. It covers smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, laptops, and desktop computers. According &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-technology-software/russian-law-requires-smart-devices-to-come-pre-installed-with-domestic-software-idUSKBN2BO4P2?il=0"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the law is part of a broader attempt by Moscow to reduce its dependence on foreign companies as well as gain more control over the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcv9fv"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;Apple agreed to comply with the law&lt;/a&gt; by giving users the option to install Russian-made apps at startup. It’s a notable concession from the company, which typically maintains tight control over the setup process of its devices. However, Apple has been willing to make changes in apparent attempts to comply with Russia’s local laws in the past, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985762/apple-maps-weather-apps-crimea-russia-territory"&gt;changing maps&lt;/a&gt; to show Crimea as Russian territory and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17803638/apple-watch-pride-face-russia-block"&gt;removing a gay pride watch face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaWGyK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that the big beneficiaries of the new law look set to be Yandex and Mail.ru. But in a statement last month a Russian official said that alternative apps will be included if they prove popular with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lqbpt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kG06a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s AI reservation service Duplex is now available in 49 states</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DPYKyDFqrOoMsgWtur8-ks_PnM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059361/akrales_180508_2553_0039.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duplex uses AI to make phone reservations through Google Assistant. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lk8DGV"&gt;More than two years after it initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17508728/google-duplex-assistant-reservations-demo"&gt;began trials&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s AI-powered reservation service Duplex is now available in 49 US states. This looks like it’ll be the limit of Duplex’s coverage in the US for the time being, as Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has no timeline to launch the service in the last hold-out state — Louisiana 	— due to unspecified local laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdpyno"&gt;Adapting to local legislation is one of the reasons Duplex has taken so long to roll out across the US. Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s had to add certain features to the service (like offering a call-back number for businesses contacted by Duplex) to make it legal in some states. In others, it’s simply waited for legislation to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HS5PX3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has had to adapt duplex to local laws&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vXecms"&gt;The new milestone of 49 states was &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/30/google-duplex-expands-to-43-us-states-coming-to-non-pixel-devices-soon/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;AndroidPolice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on a Google &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/7690269#zippy=%2Cavailability-in-the-united-states"&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; that lists Duplex’s availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3u7Yi"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018"&gt;wowed audiences&lt;/a&gt; when it first unveiled Duplex at its 2018 I/O conference. As a feature of Google Assistant, Duplex uses AI to call local businesses, making reservations at restaurants and hairdressers on your behalf using a realistic-sounding artificial voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiXCrv"&gt;But as is often the case with tech demos, Google promised more than it could deliver. In 2019 it was revealed that 25 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/technology/personaltech/ai-google-duplex.html"&gt;Duplex&lt;/a&gt; calls are made by humans, and that 19 percent of calls started by the automated system have to be completed by people. In our own reporting, we found that restaurants often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18538194/google-duplex-ai-restaurants-experiences-review-robocalls"&gt;confused Duplex&lt;/a&gt; with automated spam robocalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRNcyL"&gt;It’s not clear what percentage of Duplex calls are made by AI now, but the service can’t have been taxed by too many restaurant reservations during pandemic lockdowns. As businesses begin to open up again this year, it’ll be interesting to see if Duplex can keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is relaxing some rules about ads on drug-related videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dY9SugOhPM8_9K-37U6fssO83fQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059189/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ds6gTM"&gt;From this month, Google is updating some of its YouTube ad guidelines about drug-related videos. In a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9725604?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9153642"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/even-youtube-is-chilling-out-on-weed-1846594023?rev=1617228974804"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it’s “expanding monetization on educational, documentary or news content that may include violent interactions with law enforcement, recreational drugs and drug-related content, or sensitive events.” The update means more drug-related videos should be eligible to have ads placed next to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkRkDn"&gt;You can see the exact changes by comparing a backup of YouTube’s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210324202410if_/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification"&gt;old content guidelines from last month&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6162278#zippy=%2Cguide-to-self-certification"&gt;guidelines that are live now&lt;/a&gt;. The guidelines break down drug-related content into three categories: videos where uploaders can turn ads on, videos where ads should be turned off, and videos where they can be turned on “but only brands who opt in will run ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9JYqm9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As New York becomes the sixteenth state to legalize use of marijuana&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jBfOCG"&gt;The biggest change is a new bullet point that’s appeared in the first section, covering videos where ads can be turned on. This now covers videos focusing “on the purchase, fabrication, or distribution of drugs, such as the fabrication of home-made opioids” and “news reports about cannabis farms” that do not glorify drug use. Previously, advertisers had to opt-in to run ads against this kind of content, restricting the amount of ad revenue they could make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bslg7s"&gt;There are also a couple of bullet points that have disappeared entirely from YouTube’s list of videos where ads have to be turned off altogether. These are videos “focusing on drug consumption (including its effects) without educational or documentary context,” or which contain “promotion of regulated legal drugs or substances that can induce a high (e.g. cannabis and derivatives THC and CBD).” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ5S2"&gt;Although these exact descriptions haven’t been added to any of the other sections, YouTube has slightly amended the wording in its section describing opt-in advertiser content, which now covers “content focusing on the display or effects of drug consumption; or the creation or distribution of drugs or drug paraphernalia in a comedic, non-educational, or non-documentary context.” The exact status of content around legal highs is less clear, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnk6SP"&gt;The individual changes are minor, but they should make it easier for YouTube creators to approach the topic of drugs in their videos without worrying about ad revenue. They reflect a broader acceptance of drugs in the United States that include New York recently becoming the sixteenth state to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360455/new-york-marijuana-legalization-conviction-expungement"&gt;legalize the recreational use of marijuana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft shuts down Cortana on iOS and Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cortana for Android screenshots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzZSA9w7k2jKqQRWI_vujFGu1Gg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69059095/cortanaandroid-4.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUYmmt"&gt;Microsoft has shut down its Cortana app for iOS and Android. It’s the latest in a series of moves to end support for Cortana across multiple devices, including Microsoft’s own Surface Headphones. The Cortana app for iOS and Android is no longer supported, and Microsoft has removed it from both the App Store and Google’s Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knwFRX"&gt;“As we announced in July, we will soon be ending support for the Cortana app on Android and iOS, as Cortana continues its evolution as a productivity assistant,” reads a &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/using-cortana-on-ios-or-android-caaa50e4-31f1-4165-9659-3caf125ebd38?ui=en-us&amp;amp;rs=en-us&amp;amp;ad=us"&gt;Microsoft support note&lt;/a&gt; spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-shuts-down-cortana-app-ios-android/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “As of March 31, 2021, the Cortana content you created–such as reminders and lists–will no longer function in the Cortana mobile app, but can still be accessed through Cortana in Windows.” Cortana reminders, lists, and tasks are now available in the Microsoft To Do app instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKLeTQ"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/9/9877908/microsoft-cortana-android-ios-features"&gt;first launched Cortana&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and Android in December 2015. The app was originally designed to connect Windows 10 PCs and mobile phones, but failed to gain traction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990044/cortana-ios-android-version-3-beta-update-redesign-2018"&gt;despite a big redesign&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recognized the company’s difficulties in competing with other digital assistants a couple of years ago, revealing that Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18187992/microsoft-cortana-satya-nadella-alexa-google-assistant-competitor"&gt;no longer saw Cortana as a competitor&lt;/a&gt; to Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bA1M7N"&gt;Microsoft had once envisioned a future full of Cortana-powered fridges, toasters, and thermostats. That dream came to an end earlier this month when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320952/harman-kardon-microsoft-cortana-integration-end-of-support"&gt;first and only Cortana speaker&lt;/a&gt; removed Microsoft’s digital assistant. Other devices like the Cortana-powered GLAS thermostat are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802644/glas-thermostat-microsoft-cortana-removal"&gt;no longer powered&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft’s digital assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JXfwr"&gt;Cortana isn’t completely finished, though. Microsoft still sees value in conversational AI and the company is trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18187992/microsoft-cortana-satya-nadella-alexa-google-assistant-competitor"&gt;reposition Cortana&lt;/a&gt; as an assistant that can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18530220/microsoft-cortana-conversational-updates-build-2019"&gt;improve Microsoft’s enterprise-focused offerings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will use Tesla’s ‘megapack’ batteries at its California solar farm </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkA17njkMDUGCze_mmc2WSKSpbw=/29x0:1931x1268/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69058159/Apple_announces_new_climate_efforts_with_over_110_suppliers_transitioning_to_renewable_energy_wide_shot_of_field_033121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The construction site of the energy storage project at the California Flats solar farm.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IK7GvX"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-powers-ahead-in-new-renewable-energy-solutions-with-over-110-suppliers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360839%2Fapple-tesla-megapack-energy-storage-grid-solar-batteries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced Wednesday that it’s building a big battery storage project&lt;/a&gt; at a Northern California solar farm it spearhead in 2015. But what the company didn’t share is that the battery packs will come from Tesla, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ym0hqc"&gt;The newly-announced setup, which will store up to 240 megawatt-hours of energy, was approved by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors in 2020, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412130/Attachment_C___Applicant_s_Narrative_of_Project.pdf"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412167/Item_No__4_.pdf"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; last &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22412129/Item_No__3_.pdf"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. It will consist of 85 Tesla lithium-ion “megapacks” and be used to help power the company’s corporate headquarters in Cupertino. Monterey County’s planning chief confirmed that Apple will use the Tesla batteries in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple declined to comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kbMZB"&gt;Tesla first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20746170/tesla-megapack-battery-pge-storage-announced"&gt;the megapack battery system back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The 60MW storage setup Apple will be using is not Tesla’s biggest, though. The company has built bigger overall battery &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18715585/tesla-australia-renewable-energy-houses-electrical-grid-battery-installation"&gt;storage solutions in Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid"&gt;south of Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt; of around 100MW in size. Still, Apple touted it as “one of the largest battery projects in the country” in a press release, saying the battery system could power more than 7,000 homes for a whole day. The Tesla batteries will make it possible for Apple to store energy generated by its 130-megawatt solar array at the farm, which is called &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/11558876/apple-to-build-848-million-solar-farm"&gt;California Flats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qFN9Id"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The project was quietly approved last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nPgoN5"&gt;“The challenge with clean energy — solar and wind — is that it’s by definition intermittent,” Apple VP Lisa Jackson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-environment-idUSKBN2BN206"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “If we can do it, and we can show that it works for us, it takes away the concerns about intermittency and it helps the grid in terms of stabilization. It’s something that can be imitated or built upon by other companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfKT0C"&gt;While Apple uses lithium-ion batteries in many of its products, it’s not known to be working on any grid-scale projects. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY"&gt;reportedly developing a lithium iron phosphate battery for its electric car project&lt;/a&gt;, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl9B7F"&gt;Apple and Tesla don’t have much overlapping history, though each company is notorious for poaching talent from the other. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also said in December that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;he tried to pitch the idea of Apple buying his company back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but that Apple CEO Tim Cook “refused” to take the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1s3G2X"&gt;Tesla is best known for its electric cars, but it’s spent years trying to build up an energy storage business to compliment the solar products it acquired when it bought Solar City. It has gotten increasingly involved in large-scale energy storage projects like Apple’s over the years in addition to its home battery business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHVpjw"&gt;While it’s still modest compared to the billions of dollars generated by Tesla’s car business, the energy storage division’s products has already netted at least one other strange bedfellow customer: in 2019, Volkswagen announced it was using Tesla batteries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/4/18210439/volkswagen-tesla-battery-packs-ev-charging-station"&gt;at some of its Electrify America charging stations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa lets you control a Lamborghini’s air conditioning with just your voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0-3UJiPYadaVP1N_89H-L8_PjA=/41x0:3800x2506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057759/Lamborghini_Car_Picture.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lamborghini&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SQ6lbQ"&gt;Amazon is taking a bigger step into cars today by &lt;a href="https://media.lamborghini.com/english/latest-news/all/new-suite-of-connected-services-for-the-lamborghini-hurac-n-evo-range---automobili-lamborghini-is-fi/s/0a54b05c-9ce1-453e-8cc8-be5c2d4ec69b"&gt;integrating Alexa into Lamborghini’s Huracán EVO&lt;/a&gt;, and not just to ask questions or remotely control your home — it’s giving the assistant the ability to control settings inside the car, hands-free. The partnership was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21048587/lamborghini-rivian-amazon-alexa-integration-cars-ces-2020"&gt;originally announced last year&lt;/a&gt; as part of Amazon’s push into cars, but the integration goes beyond Alexa’s usual bag of tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efbK88"&gt;Alexa’s integration allows users to control “climate and comfort settings including air conditioning, heater, fan speed, temperature, seat heaters, defroster and air flow direction, as well as lighting,” Lamborghini says. (It can also pull up a screen showing you the car’s torque vectoring and traction control.) Of course, Alexa also has its own suite of skills for interacting with your smart home appliances, playing music and podcasts, and basic navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4SkndFRlxvpW7WtZz7feC71cI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410789/Alexa_Icon_Headunit.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If Alexa-integration means less time looking at the Huracán EVO’s center console, I think that’s a win for everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H02ibp"&gt;The Huracán EVO has some physical controls on the steering wheel and driver side door, but a majority of the car’s features are adjusted through a screen in the center console. Giving Alexa more control over the actual car itself means less time hunting and pecking through menus — “Alexa, I am hot” is apparently enough to get air conditioning going —  and more time with eyes actually on the road, which could be a win for safety and convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32LI2q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_RjYCd_Rbw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vUPmxk"&gt;It’s not like Alexa will be &lt;em&gt;driving&lt;/em&gt; your car, but give it time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSKk8G"&gt;The automotive industry’s switch from controls like knobs and dials to entirely touchscreen-based displays has been ongoing, and we even ran a review series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/screendrive-car-review"&gt;examining in-car displays as gadgets&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. Amazon’s tried to help smooth the transition with the Alexa-enabled Echo Auto in the past, but we found the accessory worked best as a simple speakerphone and Bluetooth adapter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20754404/amazon-echo-auto-review-alexa-car-price-specs-features"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt; — tasks that required knowledge of location or a consistent cellular connection did poorly. The Huracán EVO’s implementation of Alexa, with all the benefits of actually having real control over a connected car, might be a better version of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="366b7Q"&gt;Amazon and Lamborghini isn’t the only automaker / tech company team-up tackling the problem of built-in car software. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Volvo’s Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2020 with Android Automotive built-in and Google Assistant integration for similar control over settings like air conditioning, something that wasn’t part of the old Android Auto. We liked the Polestar’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;Google-built software&lt;/a&gt;, though much like Lamborghini, it comes with a high price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtDCi8"&gt;New Huracán EVOs should have the feature from the jump, but Lamborghini says all existing Huracán EVO customers can be retrofitted with support for Alexa, free-of-charge.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter now lets you add stickers to Fleets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_IVEvgAr1baU7UUnbGCn82UiGk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057753/Screen_Shot_2021_03_31_at_4.46.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yjTLCq"&gt;Twitter is adding stickers to its ephemeral, Snapchat Stories-like Fleets, the social media company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1377387235952181251"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Stickers are available for users on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3v6w"&gt;When you’re making a Fleet, you’ll be able to add stickers by tapping the smiley face icon on the bottom row of your screen. When you do, you’ll see a collection of Twitter-made animated stickers and emoji (the latter of which Twitter calls “Twemoji”). And if you search for something in the search bar at the top of the screen, Twitter will pull up GIFs sourced from Tenor and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;Facebook-owned Giphy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fjgQvo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your Fleets just got an upgrade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you can express yourself in the conversation with stickers. Add GIFs and Twemojis to a Fleet by tapping the   icon, on Android and iOS. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ihh9ZZh70a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ihh9ZZh70a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1377387235952181251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iVxCKM"&gt;If you’ve ever used stickers on Snapchat or Instagram, this new feature should feel quite familiar to you. That said, the feature might feel so familiar because both Snapchat and Instagram have offered it for years. But Twitter is still in early days with Fleets, which only became available to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;everyone back in November&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps stickers are just a first sign of more additions to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LzhXB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter’s disappearing tweets, called Fleets, are now available for everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Ubiquiti is accused of covering up a ‘catastrophic’ data breach — and it’s not denying it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-nIdL5HMV_AF2MKywigY6S8kIvw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69057731/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P6uFed"&gt;Ubiquiti, a company whose prosumer-grade routers have become synonymous with security and manageability, is being accused of covering up a “catastrophic” security breach — and after 24 hours of silence, the company has now issued a statement that doesn’t deny any of the whistleblower’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSMSAB"&gt;Originally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti emailed its customers about a supposedly minor security breach&lt;/a&gt; at a “third party cloud provider” on January 11th, but noted cybersecurity news site &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/"&gt;KrebsOnSecurity is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the breach was actually far worse than Ubiquiti let on. A whistleblower from the company who spoke to Krebs claimed that Ubiquiti itself was breached, and that the company’s legal team prevented efforts to accurately report the dangers to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEnozW"&gt;It’s worth &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/"&gt;reading Krebs’ report&lt;/a&gt; to see the full allegations, but the summary is that hackers got full access to the company’s AWS servers — since Ubiquiti allegedly left root administrator logins in an LastPass account — and they could have been able to access any Ubiquiti networking gear that customers had set up to control via the company’s cloud service (now &lt;a href="https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056846954-UniFi-Set-up-a-UniFi-Dream-Machine"&gt;seemingly required&lt;/a&gt; on some of the company’s new hardware). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIPLOc"&gt;“They were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and signing keys exfiltration,” the source told Krebs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvUvya"&gt;When Ubiquiti &lt;a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Update-to-January-2021-Account-Notification/3813e6f4-b023-4d62-9e10-1035dc51ad2e"&gt;finally issued a statement this evening&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t a reassuring one — it’s wildly insufficient. The company reiterated its point that it had no evidence to indicate that any user data had been accessed or stolen. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1377394042342756355"&gt;as Krebs points out&lt;/a&gt;, the whistleblower explicitly stated that the company doesn’t keep logs, which would act as that evidence, on who did or didn’t access the hacked servers. Ubiquiti’s statement also confirms that the hacker did try to extort it for money, but doesn’t address the allegations of a cover up. You can read the full statement below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Xhn2mt"&gt;As we informed you on January 11, we were the victim of a cybersecurity incident that involved unauthorized access to our IT systems. Given the reporting by Brian Krebs, there is newfound interest and attention in this matter, and we would like to provide our community with more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzzITH"&gt;At the outset, please note that nothing has changed with respect to our analysis of customer data and the security of our products since our notification on January 11. In response to this incident, we leveraged external incident response experts to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure the attacker was locked out of our systems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chR2aI"&gt;These experts identified no evidence that customer information was accessed, or even targeted. The attacker, who unsuccessfully attempted to extort the company by threatening to release stolen source code and specific IT credentials, never claimed to have accessed any customer information. This, along with other evidence, is why we believe that customer data was not the target of, or otherwise accessed in connection with, the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KYVH1"&gt;At this point, we have well-developed evidence that the perpetrator is an individual with intricate knowledge of our cloud infrastructure. As we are cooperating with law enforcement in an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further.&lt;br&gt;All this said, as a precaution, we still encourage you to change your password if you have not already done so, including on any website where you use the same user ID or password. We also encourage you to enable two-factor authentication on your Ubiquiti accounts if you have not already done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bp88MX"&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Team UI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLAItg"&gt;The other thing you’ll notice is that Ubiquiti is no longer pinning this on a “third party cloud provider.” The company admits that its own IT systems were accessed. But it doesn’t address much else, and the fact that the statement confirms some of what the whistleblower said while leaving the most worrying parts (e.g., the alleged cover-up, lack of logs, poor security practices, etc.) unaddressed makes me uncomfortable to be a Ubiquiti owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRNsVI"&gt;The company’s networking gear is (or was) trusted by many techies, myself included, because it promised full control over your home or small business network, without the fears of cloud-based solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSbvE0"&gt;Throughout this process, Ubiquiti has failed to communicate properly with its customers. The fact that it’s not denying the allegations, and indicates that they could be true, suggests that the original email was, at the very least, an insufficient warning. It encouraged users to change their passwords — according to Krebs, a more appropriate response would be immediately locking all accounts and requiring a password reset. Even today, the company is simply encouraging users to change their passwords and enable two-factor authentication. &lt;/p&gt;
