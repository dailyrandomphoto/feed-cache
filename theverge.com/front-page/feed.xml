    <title>Many game developers hate NFTs, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oCv2PnCHqQRYh17FWOfPWMDm_mM=/0x90:2036x1447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412457/mobile_screens.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ubisoft’s NFTs, pictured here, received a critical reception when they were announced.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXIrEb"&gt;NFTs have been a contentious topic in the video game industry as of late. Fans did not respond well to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;Ubisoft’s NFT plans&lt;/a&gt;, and the outcry to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;NFTs in &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was so vehement that the game’s developers decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;cancel them entirely&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not just video game fans that are skeptical of the new technology; many game developers have similarly strong feelings, according to the Game Developers Conference annual survey, which was released Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj9zE2"&gt;“When asked how they felt about the possibility of cryptocurrency or NFTs in games, a few called it ‘the future of gaming,’” the survey said. “However, a vast majority of respondents spoke out against both practices — noting their potential for scams, overall monetization concerns, and the environmental impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O2tQ5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How this hasn’t been identified as a pyramid scheme is beyond me”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45bmOh"&gt;Many quotes directly from developers were scathing. “How this hasn’t been identified as a pyramid scheme is beyond me,” one wrote. “I’d rather not endorse burning a rainforest down to confirm someone ‘owns’ a jpeg,” said another. “Burn ‘em to the ground. Ban everyone involved in them. I work at an NFT company currently and am quitting to get away from it,” said another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNi9rS"&gt;Not all were so critical. One positive response called cryptocurrency / NFTs “the wave of the future.” But according to the survey’s data, 70 percent of respondents said their studio had no interest in NFTs, which could indicate that we won’t see a lot of gaming NFTs in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6wOlV"&gt;The survey also showed growing support for unionization in the industry, a topic that has come to the forefront as workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;have protested Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and after Vodeo Games organized the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa"&gt;first certified video game studio union in North America&lt;/a&gt;. Fifty-five percent of respondents said game industry workers should unionize — the highest amount in the 10 years GDC has conducted the survey and up from 51 percent in 2021 — and 23 percent said talks about unionizing have happened where they work. While only 18 percent believe the industry actually will unionize, 36 percent said their companies were supportive of union talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJkSGF"&gt;However, studios still have plenty of work to do to combat toxicity, according to the survey. Only 38 percent of respondents said their companies “reached out to them to start a conversation about how misconduct and toxicity are handled in the industry,” which means that 62 percent did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;. And some of the quotes from respondents were highly critical, calling company responses “tepid lipservice” and “woefully inadequate,” among other things. Even though some did have positive things to say about their company’s action, the survey data indicates developers feel more work needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkrpFS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GDC is still set to be an in-person conference&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JhYnZv"&gt;GDC is releasing the survey just about two months ahead of the &lt;a href="https://gdconf.com/"&gt;physical GDC 2022 conference&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, the event is still scheduled to take in person from March 21st to the 25th at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAarfA"&gt;“We’re committed to having an event in person as long as it’s safe and as long as we’re permitted to do so,” Katie Stern, VP of media and entertainment at Informa Tech, the company that organizes GDC, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. To go to the conference, attendees &lt;a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2022-health-safety-and-travel-qa"&gt;must be&lt;/a&gt; vaccinated &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have received a booster shot if an initial completed vaccination took place on or before September 14th, 2021. Attendees will also be required to wear a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgAbc4"&gt;Stern said GDC is expecting 15,000 to 17,000 attendees, which is down from the &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-03-26-gdc-2019-attendance-sets-new-record-at-29-000"&gt;29,000 that attended in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the last time there was an in-person GDC show. The DICE Summit is also still scheduled to take place &lt;a href="https://www.dicesummit.org/"&gt;in person in February&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870913/e3-2022-online-virtual-event-covid-19-pandemic-omicron"&gt;E3 won’t be an in-person conference this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is building an AR headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s Clay Bavor introduces Daydream, google’s virtual reality platform during a press conference at Fisherman’s Wharf on Tuesday, October 4, 2016, in San Francisco, Calif." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2LEToZNQU0z-o5qxXNGFxRvxg8=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412429/1321751574.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Project Iris could see Google go up against Meta and Apple in the coming headset wars&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="y1Xb9n"&gt;Meta may be the loudest company building AR and VR hardware. Microsoft has HoloLens. Apple is working on something, too. But don’t count out Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlyyWL"&gt;The search giant has recently begun ramping up work on an AR headset, internally codenamed Project Iris, that it hopes to ship in 2024, according to two people familiar with the project who requested anonymity to speak without the company’s permission. Like forthcoming headsets from Meta and Apple, Google’s device uses outward-facing cameras to blend computer graphics with a video feed of the real world, creating a more immersive, mixed reality experience than existing AR glasses from the likes of Snap and Magic Leap. Early prototypes being developed at a facility in the San Francisco Bay Area resemble a pair of ski goggles and don’t require a tethered connection to an external power source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVUS4w"&gt;Google’s headset is still early in development without a clearly defined go-to-market strategy, which indicates that the 2024 target year may be more aspirational than set in stone. The hardware is powered by a custom Google processor, like its newest Google Pixel smartphone, and runs on Android, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833801/google-augmented-reality-operating-system-ar-os-team-mark-lucovsky"&gt;recent job listings indicate&lt;/a&gt; that a unique OS is in the works. Given power constraints, Google’s strategy is to use its data centers to remotely render some graphics and beam them into the headset via an internet connection. I’m told that the Pixel team is involved in some of the hardware pieces, but it’s unclear if the headset will ultimately be Pixel-branded. The name Google Glass is almost certainly off the table, thanks to the early blowback (remember “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5955973/we-are-all-glassholes-now"&gt;Glasshole?&lt;/a&gt;”) and the fact that it technically still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578691/google-meet-glass-ar-remote-assistance-rollout-open-beta"&gt;exists as an enterprise product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2FYcW5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Project Iris is a tightly kept secret inside Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lU3qDq"&gt;Project Iris marks a return to a hardware category that Google has a long and checkered history in. It started with the splashy, ill-fated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates"&gt;debut of Google Glass&lt;/a&gt; in 2012. And then a multi-year effort to sell VR headsets quietly fizzled out in 2019. Google has since been noticeably silent about its hardware aspirations in the space, instead choosing to focus on software features like Lens, its visual search engine, and AR directions in Google Maps. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg has bet his company on AR and VR, hiring thousands and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;rebranding from Facebook to Meta&lt;/a&gt;. “Metaverse” has become an inescapable buzzword. And Apple is readying its own mixed reality headset for &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/apple-s-hotly-anticipated-headset-risks-being-delayed-until-2023?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;as soon as later this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPS4lP"&gt;Project Iris is a tightly kept secret inside Google, tucked away in a building that requires special keycard access and non-disclosure agreements. The core team working on the headset is roughly 300 people, and Google plans to hire hundreds more. The executive overseeing the effort is Clay Bavor, who reports directly to CEO Sundar Pichai and also manages Project Starline, an ultra-high-resolution video chat booth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813731/google-project-starline-specs-features-research-paper-8k-tv-microphones-camera-capture-pods"&gt;that was demoed last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcBjAmmVH_tloCUEDPyR5qtjxfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23180669/Google_Project_Starline.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Google’s Project Starline&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AV4JAp"&gt;If Starline is any indication, Project Iris could be a technical marvel. People who have tried Starline say it’s one of the most impressive tech demos ever. Its ability to recreate who you’re chatting with in 3D is supposedly hyper-realistic. In &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/how-were-testing-project-starline-google/"&gt;an eye-tracking test with employees&lt;/a&gt;, Google found that people focused roughly 15 percent more on who they were talking to using Starline versus a traditional video call and that memory recall was nearly 30 percent better when asked about the details of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="olYgbO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is hoping to ship Starline by 2024 along with Iris&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LPvZ8z"&gt;I’ve heard that Google is hoping to ship Starline by 2024 along with Iris. It recently hired Magic Leap’s CTO, Paul Greco, to the team in a previously unreported move. A pilot program for using Starline to facilitate remote meetings is in the works with various Fortune 500 companies. Google also wants to deploy Starline internally as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;post-pandemic hybrid work strategy&lt;/a&gt;. A big focus for Starline is bringing the cost of each unit down from tens of thousands of dollars. (Like Iris, there’s a chance that Google doesn’t meet its target ship year for Starline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIW0Ff"&gt;Bavor has managed Google’s VR and AR efforts for years, dating back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/5/11862258/google-cardboard-daydream-controller"&gt;Google Cardboard&lt;/a&gt; and Daydream, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17318648/lenovo-mirage-solo-google-daydream-standalone-vr-headset-review"&gt;VR software and hardware platform&lt;/a&gt; that came out around the same time as the Oculus. He is a close friend of Pichai who has been at Google since 2005. Last November, he was given the title VP of Labs, a remit that includes Project Starline, Iris, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/google-forms-blockchain-group-under-newly-appointed-executive?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new blockchain division&lt;/a&gt;, and Google’s in-house product incubator called Area 120. At the time of his promotion, Google &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/google-reorg-moves-ar-vr-starline-and-area-120-into-new-labs-team-reporting-directly-to-sundar-pichai/"&gt;reportedly told&lt;/a&gt; employees that the Labs team is “focused on extrapolating technology trends and incubating a set of high-potential, long-term projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDDWR6"&gt;Some of the other leaders working on Project Iris include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qk82Zb"&gt;Shahram Izadi, a senior director of engineering who also manages Google’s ARCore software toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjKX9L"&gt;Eddie Chung, a senior director of product management who previously ran product for Google Lens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8mtJ0a"&gt;Scott Huffman, the VP and creator of Google Assistant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k5BHZB"&gt;Kurt Akeley, a distinguished engineer and the former CTO of the light-field camera startup Lytro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2Dyl8r"&gt;Mark Lucovsky, Google’s senior director of operating systems for AR who was recently in a similar job at Meta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuB9-OpXU_PGF-xxL9HkCUw7Tpc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19444528/Focals2.0_TeaseHero_02_RGB_3000x1543.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: North&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;North’s first pair of smart glasses were called Focals. Google bought the company in mid-2020 before the second version was released.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2dCx04"&gt;Google’s interest in AR dates back to Glass and its early investment in Magic Leap. I’ve heard that the calculus for the Magic Leap investment was to have optionality to buy the company down the road if it figured out a viable path to mass-market AR hardware. In a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-wont-release-its-oculus-quest-vr-competitor-anytime-soon/"&gt;2019 interview&lt;/a&gt;, Bavor said, “I characterize the phase we’re in as deep R&amp;amp;D, focused on building the critical Lego bricks behind closed doors.” A year later, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308281/google-north-focals-glasses-purchase-acquire"&gt;bought a smart glasses startup called North&lt;/a&gt; that was focused on fitting AR tech into a pair of normal-looking eyewear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLuQx2"&gt;Most of the North team still works at Google. A recent slew of &lt;a href="https://next.reality.news/news/google-signals-smartglasses-ramp-up-via-job-postings-for-waveguides-other-ar-disciplines-0384557/"&gt;job postings related to waveguides&lt;/a&gt; — a display technology more suited for AR glasses rather than an immersive headset like Project Iris — suggests they could be working on another device in Canada. Google declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KcgO51"&gt;Last October, Pichai &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/sundar-pichai-google-ar/"&gt;said on an earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that Google is “thinking through” AR and that it will be a “major area of investment for us.” The company certainly has the cash to fund ambitious ideas. It has top technical talent, a robust software ecosystem with Android, and compelling products for AR glasses like Google Lens. But it’s still unclear if Google plans to invest as aggressively as Meta, which is already spending &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;$10 billion per year on AR and VR&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has thousands working on its headset and a more far-out pair of AR glasses. Until it indicates otherwise, Google seems to be playing catchup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Messenger Kids’ new internet safety games are mostly teaching kids how to use Messenger </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Facebook Messenger logo seen displayed on a smartphone and Meta Platforms logo in the background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGvwjGQiw3Fqe7lhiTMWh9V-Zas=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412323/1237277727.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta Messenger for Kids is adding new games to teach online safety | Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UaXlZy"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta has launched new activities on its Messenger Kids platform aimed at teaching internet etiquette to children. According to &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/teaching-internet-safety-on-messenger-kids/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Erik Michael Weitzman, director of product management at Messenger Kids, the new gamified activities will “help kids learn how to use the internet safely and practice making healthy decisions online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmhiMP"&gt;Pledge Planets is based on what Weitzman says are the tenets of the Messenger Kids Pledge: be kind, be respectful, be safe and have fun. The first episode titled “Be Kind” includes two games that will help kids “learn and practice how to act with kindness,” the company says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TcbVbq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rough Reviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Players must help the owner read through the reviews and match the correct online response to each one. This game teaches kids to recognize kind and unkind behavior and become familiar with tools like blocking and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMA0Bg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Players build a sandwich order by selecting the emojis that best respond to the customer’s mood. This game teaches kids how to read people’s emotions online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ts4suXC_nmlxfovM_jpH7aThSKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181979/01_Be_Kind_Episode.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Messenger Kids introduced two new games to teach online safety and awareness to children&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TBzEdB"&gt;Weitzman writes that the company developed the pledge and the Pledge Planets activities with guidance from experts in online safety and child development. Meta / Facebook first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16725494/facebook-messenger-kids-app-launch-ios-iphone-preview"&gt;introduced Messenger Kids in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a scaled-down version of its Messenger app that links to a parent’s Facebook account. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;last year, Facebook shelved&lt;/a&gt; plans for a planned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;kids’ version&lt;/a&gt; of its Instagram photo-sharing platform after widespread criticism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iO9Mxq"&gt;Setting aside the question of whether Facebook / Meta / Messenger is qualified to offer guidance on healthy decisions and internet safety, what these two games are &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;doing is teaching kids how to use Messenger. Bear with me a second, but the first thing I thought of was (the much more well-intentioned and genuine) Sesame Street, arguably the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7228353/sesame-street-changed-world"&gt;first TV show designed to help teach preschoolers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiHCJa"&gt;While Sesame Street is rightly lauded for having a positive impact on kids’ learning skills and for its diverse, multicultural cast of characters, many have also noted that the show did a great job teaching kids &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/07/the-1960s-experiment-childrens-tv/398681/"&gt;how to watch television&lt;/a&gt;, keeping them engaged and entertained through play learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JKaWqW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Facebook’s struggle to keep young people","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6cIljI"&gt;Meta’s platforms, however, have something of a troubled history when it comes to child safety online; internal documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen suggested Facebook / Meta was aware that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22816730/mosseri-testimony-instagram-senate-hearing-haugen-child-safety-facebook-meta"&gt;Instagram can be “toxic”&lt;/a&gt; for teenage users and that its algorithms could direct kids to content that may encourage self-harm. And a study last May by online child safety advocacy organization Thorn found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432863/child-safety-platforms-thorn-report-snap-facebook-youtube-tiktok"&gt;children receive abuse and harassment&lt;/a&gt; on social platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, at much higher rates than previously believed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIyuMp"&gt;And, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;revealed internal documents show&lt;/a&gt; that Meta is hemorrhaging younger users, with one projection finding Meta would lose 45 percent of its teenage users over the next two years. Most kids don’t see Facebook as a platform meant for them, and while Instagram has remained popular with teen users, it too has lost ground in recent years both to bullies on its app and to competitors like TikTok. So Meta teaching a whole new generation how to use one of its products would seem right in line with its need to get younger users and keep them playing along. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK company behind Tom Cruise space film unveils plans to launch space movie studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fp7gJ1rtxEOeQYwq7O0fZDG4WjM=/385x0:2815x1620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412212/01see.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An animation of the SEE-1 module attached to Axiom’s space station on the ISS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Axiom/S.E.E.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1bisFN"&gt;On Thursday, a UK-based company that claims to be producing Tom Cruise’s upcoming film in space said it plans to attach the first-ever space movie studio and sports arena to the International Space Station as early as 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXqrHf"&gt;Called Space Entertainment Enterprise, or S.E.E., the company also announced it is working with commercial space station builder Axiom Space, which has its own partnership with NASA to build and attach an experimental space station to the ISS. That station is called Axiom Station, and Axiom hopes to launch its first module, called Axiom Hub 1, to the ISS by 2024. The company will then build out the space station before eventually separating it from the ISS in 2028 and making it a free-flying vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P0zp75"&gt;&lt;q&gt;S.E.E. plans to attach its own module to the new growing space station in December of 2024&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3j3cqm"&gt;But while Axiom Station is attached to the ISS, S.E.E. plans to attach its own module to the growing space station in December of 2024. Dubbed SEE-1, the module will be available to individuals who want to film or live stream content in space, “including ﬁlms, television, music, and sports events,” according to a press release announcing the news. Animated videos and images of SEE-1 &lt;a href="https://www.seespacearena.com/"&gt;on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt; show the module as a giant white sphere, though there were no available designs of what the interior will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRZ6mW"&gt;Though the module will belong to S.E.E., it is being built by Axiom Space. According to the S.E.E. press release, it will be an inflatable module that will stretch up to 6 meters, or nearly 20 feet, in diameter. S.E.E. says that it will allow third parties to also use the studio for their own projects. No costs or estimated budgets were provided for the project, nor did S.E.E. detail how much it would charge others to use the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxwtwK"&gt;“Adding a dedicated entertainment venue to Axiom Station’s commercial capabilities in the form of SEE-1 will expand the station’s utility as a platform for a global user base and highlight the range of opportunities the new space economy offers,” Michael Suffredini, Axiom’s CEO, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwTIuA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;S.E.E. also revealed itself to be the production company behind Tom Cruise’s mystery space movie&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nYbQU"&gt;With today’s announcement, S.E.E. also revealed itself to be the production company behind Tom Cruise’s mystery space movie. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248460/nasa-tom-cruise-movie-international-space-station"&gt;NASA announced that it was working with the famous actor&lt;/a&gt; to potentially send him to the International Space Station to film a project. The actor’s ride to space is reportedly SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which is used to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ba0xCu"&gt;Later, NASA confirmed in a podcast that &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/everything-we-know-and-dont-about-tom-cruises-plans-to-film-a-movie-in-space/"&gt;Axiom was going to be involved in getting Tom Cruise to orbit&lt;/a&gt;. While Axiom builds space stations, it has also contracted with NASA and SpaceX to buy rides on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon to send private individuals to the ISS. Axiom’s first private astronaut mission on a Crew Dragon, called Axiom-1, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22785888/axiom-space-ax-1-science-experiments-spacex-crew-dragon-iss"&gt;is scheduled to take flight in March&lt;/a&gt;. However, there’s no set date or confirmation for Tom Cruise’s flight. As for what Cruise plans to film up in the cosmos, all that’s been reported so far is that director Doug Liman is involved and that the film will not be a &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible&lt;/em&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYAFG4"&gt;S.E.E. was co-founded by producers Elena and Dmitry Lesnevsky. Their company boasts an impressive list of consultants of former Viacom and HBO executives. The company says it’s currently looking for investors on the Tom Cruise space project, which &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/video/tom-cruise-movie-shot-in-space-budget-deadlinenow/"&gt;Deadline reported in 2020&lt;/a&gt; would have a budget of at least $200 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wakHeD"&gt;However, it’s possible the budget could be even higher, given how much going to space costs. Just one seat on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;thought to run around $55 million&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656280/nasa-space-station-private-astronauts-commercial-business"&gt;NASA charges additional fees for private astronauts using the space station’s facilities&lt;/a&gt; while in orbit. S.E.E. says it plans to conduct a fundraising round soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWEhSX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Chicken Run sequel will be a three-piece family deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZq47WGR9OoxZ6B6ru_jM1-cS-A=/500x0:5900x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412098/CR2_PR_Still_Egg_Leg_16_9.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Aardman / NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4qkyv"&gt;After years of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/6/23/21300251/chicken-run-2-sequel-netflix-story-plot-details"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicken Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fans wondering whether the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/18/12500814/laika-studios-behind-the-scenes-kubo-and-the-two-strings-video"&gt;stop-motion&lt;/a&gt; classic would ever be back for a sequel, Netflix finally answered last summer with a resounding “yes,” but was tight-lipped about key details like who all might be coming back to reprise their roles and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/mel-gibson-controversies-career-1234696080/"&gt;who might not&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmxsON"&gt;Though we’re still a ways out from director Sam Fell’s &lt;em&gt;Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget’&lt;/em&gt; premiere, Netflix has just shared a cache of new information about the sequel along with our first look (sort of) at the movie’s central hero. Set some time after the first film, &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Nugget &lt;/em&gt;finds Ginger (Thandiwe Newton) and Rocky (Zachary Levi) settling into new lives on an idyllic island completely devoid of humans where they feel safe enough to finally start a family. Though the chickens are delighted by the birth of the daughter Molly (Bella Ramsey), the young chick’s wanderlust soon puts her at odds with her parents after her curiosity about the mainland is piqued by rumors about the dangerous things that happen there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xch0Vr"&gt;Though Newton, Ramsey, and Levi are all newcomers to the &lt;em&gt;Chicken Run &lt;/em&gt;franchise, they’ll be joined by Jane Horrocks, Imelda Staunton, and Lynn Ferguson, who voiced the chickens Babs, Hunty, and Mac, respectively, in the first film. Rounding out the cast are Josie Sedgwick-Davies as Edie, David Bradley as Fowler, Romesh Ranganathan as Nick, Daniel Mays as Fletcher, and Nick Mohammed as Dr. Fry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSB4rUMPBXjiK_RFY9e3k-0Ojd0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182041/Screen_Shot_2022_01_20_at_10.31.31_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Nick park, creator and director of Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="52Osfc"&gt;Along with the &lt;em&gt;Chicken Run &lt;/em&gt;news&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Netflix also announced that it’s moving forward with another &lt;em&gt;Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit &lt;/em&gt;feature co-directed by Wal&lt;em&gt;lace &amp;amp; Gromit &lt;/em&gt;creator Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham. A press release about the currently unnamed &lt;em&gt;Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit &lt;/em&gt;movie describes its story as focusing on what happens when Wallace’s latest invention — a “smart gnome” — seems to gain sentience and begin wreaking havoc upon its creator’s and Gromit’s quiet lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BR5QJO"&gt;While there are currently no details on when to expect the next &lt;em&gt;Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit &lt;/em&gt;feature, &lt;em&gt;Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget &lt;/em&gt;is slated to hit Netflix in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Many of the best Xbox backward-compatible games are discounted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Red Dead Redemption" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qlLdwo-p9OfvLJERwvdwaZEEuLk=/141x0:1019x585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70412023/gallery-1458823402-red-dead-redemption-2-does-it-star-john-marston-s-son-out-for-revenge-red-dead-redempti-424515.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2sYA8"&gt;Microsoft is hosting steep discounts on backward-compatible digital games from the original Xbox and Xbox 360 eras, as it does occasionally. If you agree with the opinion that being able to play older games on the Series X or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-S/dp/B08G9J44ZN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; (or even the Xbox One) is one of their most appealing features, you’ll probably find at least one game that you’ll want to pick up during this sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1JVxX"&gt;If you haven’t explored the depths of the Xbox backward-compatible game catalog before, it can be daunting. And in case you don’t really have an idea of what might interest you, we’ve pulled a smattering of deals out of the sale to highlight. Notably, these games currently are not available through Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N01qPZqVEGyKScJURIdsChCaC5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528183/new_timesplitters_game_580x334.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Free Radical Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 2 got amazing cover art outside of the US.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XoABVa"&gt;Into first-person shooters? Check out the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ftimesplitters-2%2F9NJBX726M8J9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($2.49) and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ftimesplitters-future-perfect%2F9N51S9QZMSB6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters Future Perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($2.49), two games made by Free Radical Design that have a similar feel (in terms of gameplay and mission objectives) to &lt;em&gt;Goldeneye &lt;/em&gt;on the N64, but they’re a lot weirder. They’re charming in their oddity, in the way that a lot of early 2000s stuff was, and if you have some friends around for local multiplayer, it didn’t get much better than what this game offered back in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3GJoa"&gt;You can catch up on the &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; franchise with &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fred-dead-revolver%2F9NP7Q2SSS81W" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Revolver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the original Xbox ($8.99), which is essentially an arcade game compared to its two open-world sequels. Speaking of its sequels, you can snag &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fred-dead-redemption%2FBWKLFHWT7DHC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox 360 for $9.89 — one of the best open-world games made to date (it’s even better than &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; — fight me).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45CT5_ld0BnJ7ua3rl4OzqurQ5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23181899/midnightclub_losangeles.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A still taken from Midnight Club: Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nahyf3"&gt;Depending on your age, there’s a slight possibility that you might not know that Rockstar Games used to make surprisingly good racing games, among other things. &lt;em&gt;Midnight Club&lt;/em&gt; competed with the likes of the &lt;em&gt;Fast and Furious&lt;/em&gt;-inspired &lt;em&gt;Need for Speed: Underground&lt;/em&gt;, focusing solely on street racing. While &lt;em&gt;Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition&lt;/em&gt; is usually regarded as the best in the series, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fmidnight-club-los-angeles-complete%2FBV6WLXGS887C" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt; ($10.04) certainly isn’t bad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcgZce"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Frockstar-table-tennis%2FBVZ4H08BMQ3H" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rockstar Games Presents: Table Tennis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best graphical showcases for the Xbox 360 in the early days of the console, still holds up as a great sports game for $5.99. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fbully-scholarship-edition%2FC3WX803ZX8SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bully: Scholarship Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another well-regarded Rockstar Games title that hasn’t seen a follow-up, is discounted to $5.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ejg5"&gt;Sega released a bevy of interesting games as Xbox exclusives following the failure of its Dreamcast console that have become, at the very least, cult classics, including &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fpanzer-dragoon-orta%2FC3LNP2Q4422J" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panzer Dragoon Orta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ($4.99) and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fgunvalkyrie%2F9MZ08F46GC5Z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gunvalkyrie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;($5.99). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ninja Gaiden Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TLOd7H--AMbIRgxvT-UZmMkH8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397952/8bc003df_2fc2_4cd1_8f1f_ffa84b3c7573.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Xbox easter egg hidden in Ninja Gaiden Black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7Fw7XG"&gt;This one’s out of Sega’s realm, but I highly recommend picking up &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergexboxBCdeals012022&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fninja-gaiden-black%2Fc17kks83s9gs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $9.99. Originally released for the Xbox, its responsive, satisfying gameplay holds up well to today’s standards, and compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350928/ninja-gaiden-master-collection-koei-tecmo-black-game-preservation-data-loss"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; trilogy released in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, this is the definitive version of the &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; remake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZMvDU"&gt;I have praise for a lot more games, but I, unfortunately, can’t wax nostalgic about this all day. Here are some others that I’d recommend checking out:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $250 on iRobot’s poop-avoiding Roomba j7 Plus vacuum</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Cq_tpOpSomBEq1ewcYpYx3Z1tI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411998/vtuohy_211029_4963_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jwLVDK"&gt;Let’s get down to the dirty business of things and keep it professional. Here’s a deal on a robot vacuum that detects doo-doo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuIaiE"&gt;The iRobot Roomba j7 Plus is one of the newest models from the most recognizable brand in the robot vacuum world. It’s currently on sale for $599 ($250 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsdlcHrsIu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Self-Emptying-Robot-Vacuum/dp/B094NYHTMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Firobot%2Droomba%2Dj7%2Dself%2Demptying%2Drobot%2Dvacuum&amp;amp;afftrack=vergedailydeals012022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;. This one has the kinds of fancy features you may come to expect from a fairly expensive robo-vac, like room mapping with keep-out zones, spot cleaning, and automatic bin-emptying. It also has an ace up its sleeve: the ability to detect pet waste and (ideally) not run over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXJnW8"&gt;Our resident smart home expert and reviewer, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22880352/irobot-roomba-j7-plus-samsung-jet-bot-ai-plus-robot-vacuum-review-comparison-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently tested the Roomba J7 Plus against the Samsung Jet Bot AI Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and the Roomba scored higher with its better price-to-performance value compared to the pricier Samsung model. Though it did run over the fake poop she laid out for it one time out of the dozen tests she ran — so just like with actual pets, accidents happen. Though if it does make a smeary mess of fecal matter on your floor in the first year of ownership, then iRobot will replace the vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J2hHUB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10986398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8274Xa"&gt;All right now, let’s not be party-poopers for this entire post. The JBL Charge 5 is a Bluetooth speaker that gets loud, can go anywhere, and can keep your phone juiced up while you’re vibing to tunes. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals012022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fjbl-charge-5-bluetooth-speaker-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has it for $149.99&lt;/a&gt; in black, teal, red, and green color options. That’s about $30 off the usual new cost, and it’s the best price around right now. We have not tested this exact model yet, but the JBL Charge line has found its way into &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; list of best Bluetooth speakers in the past. The Charge 5 ups the waterproofing and dustproofing with an IP67 rating, so it is perfect for socially distant outdoor events. You’ll be prepared for the summer beaches already, and it’s only January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuwcWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10986441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DL2VqB"&gt;Keyboards are a very personal thing, and I’m about to get a little personal with a somewhat spicy take: full-size mechanical keyboards from the big accessory brands like Razer and Corsair are usually overpriced for what you get. Since they’re marketed to gamers, these companies know that, generally speaking, they’re often willing to spend extra on extravagant features, like RGB lighting (hey, I’m guilty of it on occasion, too, so I’m also putting myself on blast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7doyo"&gt;And yet, here’s a good Logitech mechanical keyboard that seems to be priced &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;right for what it offers. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsd3nEFn81" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Its G413 in silver&lt;/a&gt; is just $49.99 ($20 off) at Best Buy. It uses Logitech’s own &lt;a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Finnovation%2Fmechanical-switches.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup012022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Romer-G&lt;/a&gt; tactile mechanical switches. While it lacks RGB lighting, its white key backlighting is more than serviceable, and the subdued look lends it the ability to blend in at an office or just about anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nBTk6f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10986471"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I8ozmS"&gt;Remember when I said let’s not be suckers for superfluous things like colorful lights? Yeah, hold that thought while we get nerdy about some colorful smart lights because Nanoleaf is running a big sale on its &lt;a href="https://press.nanoleaf.me/2022/01/19/saying-goodbye-to-nanoleaf-light-panels/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;original light panels&lt;/a&gt; that are being phased out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOVl1J"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://us-shop.nanoleaf.me/products/light-panels-smarter-kit-30-panels" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nanoleaf Light Panels Rhythm 30-pack smarter kit is about $260 off&lt;/a&gt;, knocking the price down to $419.99 from its original $679.97. Yes, that’s a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of money for lighting, but 30 panels is enough to make some really unique designs on your wall and really light up a small space. Nanoleaf has some other kits of light panels and accessories for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnanoleaf.me%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2F%3Fproduct%3Dlight-panels%26type%3Dall&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F20%2F22891218%2Firobot-roomba-j7-plus-vacuum-jbl-charge-5-logitech-keyboard-nanoleaf-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;up to 50 percent off&lt;/a&gt;, and while these models are being discontinued, the company is promising to maintain their current functionality in its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g2ZoJ4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10987303"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QRjVtT"&gt;Some other deals that don’t stink:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jIy8KN"&gt;Anker’s handy dual-port USB-C 40W 521 Charger is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Durable-Compact-Included/dp/B09C5SC9FW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15 percent off on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you click the on-page coupon, bringing it down to $30.59.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CnrVW7"&gt;While not its best price, the Sony 75-inch X85J LED 4K UHD TV is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsuEYfhOFN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299.99 ($300 off) at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, it supports a native 120Hz refresh rate, a feature you don’t typically see on TVs this big for this low of a price. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s4xuPt"&gt;Need a microSD card for a Switch, phone or some other device? The SanDisk 400GB Ultra microSDXC is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-MicroSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$43.49 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, only about $5 away from its all-time lowest price we saw during the holidays. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NAOMBx"&gt;Razer’s Battle Bundle consists of its BlackShark V2 X headset, DeathAdder V2 mouse, and Gigantus V2 M mouse pad, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsuH17omTS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has it for $69.99&lt;/a&gt; ($80 off). That’s a nice value if you need both a mouse and headset and prefer wired over wireless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Boost Celero 5G review: budget phone with budget battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Boost’s first 5G phone is cheap but unremarkable&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ukL1pq"&gt;Boost Mobile, the MVNO owned by the Dish Network as a result of the Sprint / T-Mobile merger, is in a tricky spot. Not only does it need to expand its user base for nationwide 5G service, but it also needs to migrate over a million Boost customers from Sprint’s CDMA 3G network to its 4G / 5G service (operated by T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T) soon since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22741762/tmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost"&gt;T-Mobile will be shutting down Sprint’s CDMA network by March 31, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. This means the carrier will need to convince its many customers to upgrade to newer 4G or, more preferably, 5G phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJv8Us"&gt;That’s where Dish’s first self-branded phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22697318/dish-5g-game-279-boost-mobile-exclusive-5g-phone-prepaid"&gt;$279.99 Celero 5G&lt;/a&gt; (though often discounted to less), comes into play. This Android phone with iPhone-like looks works better than you’d expect and takes decent photos in good lighting conditions. Unfortunately, it has the exact same price as the popular and well-reviewed Samsung Galaxy A32 5G that’s also available at Boost, making the Celero a direct competitor. So how does the Celero 5G stack up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wloz9j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Celero 5G’s silver back cover" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDWJHBxlyr5CXKDjc9NhGN0OSh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098805/gsin_190404_4933_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s plastic body actually makes the phone more lightweight and comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q51CwH"&gt;Celero 5G Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MjNajL"&gt;Like T-Mobile’s REVVL V Plus 5G and AT&amp;amp;T’s Radiant, the Celero 5G is made by Wingtech Technology and custom-designed for Boost (when you plug the phone into a computer, the phone is named “WT Celero 5G”). At first glance, it looks like an iPhone clone: it has an all-round silver trim, square camera array, and the unmistakable rims around the camera lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tp0or"&gt;While its matte silver back cover is surprisingly smudge-resistant, its smooth surface makes the phone way too easy to slide off tables and hands — you’ll want to get a case to protect it. For a big phone (it measures 6.56 x 3 x 0.33-inch (166.60 x 76.20 x 8.40mm)), the Celero’s all-plastic body and beveled edges make it comfortable to hold, and it’s not too heavy either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Closeup of the Celero 5G’s power button" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZyCvq8Ct59l-U9QZM33Du8cr8ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098806/gsin_190404_4933_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The placement of the Celero 5G’s power and fingerprint sensor is too low and recessed for easy access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A closeup of the bottom of the Celero 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XTbUN1GuPYJSnR21TiXjH36KR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098807/gsin_190404_4933_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s 3.5mm audio jack is located at the bottom of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KYi1dO"&gt;The power button and integrated fingerprint sensor on the Celero are too low and too recessed to use easily, however. As a result, it takes an extra second to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor — because I’m usually fumbling for the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oqrFrR"&gt;Celero 5G Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4zJeD8"&gt;The Celero 5G’s screen is big but dim: you need to set the screen brightness to around 100 percent to use it comfortably indoors (you’ll be squinting at this screen outdoors). It has a large 6.5-inch LCD display that is only 720p in resolution, which means high-resolution photos and videos won’t look the sharpest here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGKj1j"&gt;For a sub-$300 phone using the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dimensity-700-vs-Dimensity-720_13199_12994.247596.0.html"&gt;“fast mid-range SoC” MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor&lt;/a&gt; and 4GB RAM for support, the Celero 5G can handle basic tasks without any significant lag. I was able to cycle between my many opened tabs and apps quickly and could even play a YouTube video while I read an article. Like the Samsung A32, the Celero comes with just 64GB of internal storage, but the Celero has a microSD card slot that can support up to a 2TB card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="g2qLIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Celero 5G’s display is dim and low-resolution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QbKaI"&gt;I played a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite,&lt;/em&gt; and the Celero 5G handled the game like a champ. The responsive touchscreen made it easy to move my Charmander around the battlefield, even as the attack moves became more complicated. When I plugged in my wired headphones into its bottom-facing audio jack, I could hear a vocal track on the game’s theme music that I’d previously missed. Its bottom-firing mono-speaker is passable: it managed to play the demanding “Dance at the Gym: Mambo” from the 2021 &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack with clarity, if not a bit too loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY4NzL"&gt;Although I appreciate that this phone is running a mostly unmodified version of Android 11, the Celero is unfortunately full of bloatware. In addition to the usual suspects like a folder worth of Amazon apps, there are two folders called “Lifestyle” and “Games’’ that contain a bunch of app shortcuts that the phone will download if you click on the “Add” button. There is even an App Spotlight app that shows you 24 app shortcuts the carrier is encouraging you to download (including &lt;em&gt;The Epoch Times&lt;/em&gt;). To make matters worse, every time you wake or turn on your phone, you will see three apps doing some sort of configuration in the background, but it’s not clear how to disable those processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWoJmE"&gt;As Dish’s first self-branded phone, it’s hard to know if and when the Celero will receive any OS or security updates to extend its lifespan. This is a far cry from more established brands like Samsung, which have a four-year software commitment on the A32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3xpRV"&gt;The battery life on the Celero 5G is not as long as its 4,000mAh battery would imply. Although I managed to get about 8 hours and 15 minutes of screen time before I had to recharge it, that was with very moderate use. I was only on Wi-Fi to listen to a couple of podcasts, post on Twitter, check email, and chat with family on Google Hangouts. If you use mostly 4G or 5G on this phone, you’ll probably need to keep the charger or a portable battery close by because the Celero might not last a full day of heavy use. The included 15W charger is not exactly a fast charger either: it took over two hours to fully recharge the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A4UaIl"&gt;Celero 5G Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Closeup of the Celero 5G’s rear cameras" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSiJcKjP46v0jttLhpuJYDH5__o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098808/gsin_190404_4933_0005_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G’s cameras are pretty basic and not suitable for night or sports photography.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Zgcp"&gt;The Celero 5G’s cameras are the standard fare for its class: it has a 16-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies. With good lighting and the right framing, you should be able to get some good photos with good details to share online. However, I wouldn’t use this phone to take action or night photography because these cameras just aren’t capable enough for more challenging situations. The front camera, on the other hand, can capture relatively bright selfies even in dim lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zn42Wa"&gt;Like other budget phones, the Celero’s ultrawide photos tend to skew yellow, especially when you compare a photo taken with the main camera of the same scene. Whether I take outdoor holiday decoration photos or indoors inside a diner, the ultrawide camera has a knack for inexplicably boosting the yellow channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="77JkcT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10954550"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bITS9Q"&gt;Worst of all, the Celero’s camera app is annoying to use. It can take an extra second to switch between the main and the ultrawide cameras or different modes, which might be the difference between you getting or missing the shot. It also takes about two seconds to process a live focus shot, so you’ll need a steady hand and patience when using this mode. When I tried to take a photo that happened to have a QR code, the app kept asking me if I wanted to visit that website, even after I repeatedly tapped “No.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EPlgm0"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Celero 5G’s silver back cover" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4M0ExMH_y5UcI_d8jbdBZvWTxeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098811/gsin_190404_4933_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Celero 5G has tough competition from budget 5G phones from Samsung, Motorola and OnePlus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cdKDPA"&gt;As much as I enjoyed the $279.99 Celero 5G for its iPhone-like looks and capable performance, I have a hard time recommending it over the same-priced Samsung Galaxy A32 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzivR5"&gt;For the same money, the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G offers a bigger battery at 5,000mAh, a better 48-megapixel main camera, C-band 5G compatibility, and four years of software support from Samsung. With the Celero, it’s hard to know if it’ll get software support like security updates, from whom and for how long, not to mention its smaller battery and less powerful cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYk2yt"&gt;Boost also offers the $249.99 Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G, which is $30 cheaper than the Celero, comes with double the internal storage at 128GB, and also features a 48-megapixel camera. The best-in-class OnePlus Nord N200 5G is even cheaper at $239, and it includes a 1080p display with a 90Hz refresh rate, though it’s not clear if this unlocked phone will be compatible on Boost’s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cq9KHM"&gt;I wish Boost would give the Celero 5G a permanent price cut, like its current promotional price of $139.99 or lower. This would make it a whole lot easier to recommend the Celero despite its shortcomings — shorter battery life, more bloatware, untested brand. But without that significant discount, the Celero 5G is not your best bet at Boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ydgALv"&gt;While it’s nice that the government will be sending us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;four free at-home rapid COVID test kits a month&lt;/a&gt;, that’s not going to be enough for many households. However, if you’ve got private insurance through an employer or a group, you do have an alternative: you can get a reimbursement for — or pick up free at approved retailers — &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/how-to-get-your-at-home-OTC-COVID-19-test-for-free"&gt;up to eight FDA-authorized at-home COVID tests per person per month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ct2JeT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to order free rapid COVID tests from the US government","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22889745/rapid-covid-tests-free-website-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XhHXmX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/01/10/biden-harris-administration-requires-insurance-companies-group-health-plans-to-cover-cost-at-home-covid-19-tests-increasing-access-free-tests.html"&gt;Announced back in January&lt;/a&gt;, the new rules state that private health insurers are required to cover these tests without needing approval from a doctor or other medical provider. (If you need more kits, you can also get them covered if it is ordered by a medical provider.) This requirement went into effect on January 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNVdGk"&gt;How do you take advantage of this? That depends on your specific health insurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3ozFB"&gt;Currently, the best way to find out how to get reimbursed for tests you have purchased is to log on to your health insurance site. I checked about six insurance sites, and currently, most are offering claim forms that you can fill out and submit with proof of purchase. Eventually, according to the announcement, we should be able to pick up kits at approved pharmacies and stores; however, it’s early days yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvVEp9"&gt;Some other things to be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vQtkWn"&gt;You will have to provide proof of purchase along with your claim form, so if you make the purchase at a local store, don’t lose that receipt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BqFMmH"&gt;Your insurance company may have a list of approved kits and / or approved retailers that it will accept claims for. As a result, it’s a good idea to check your insurer’s site before buying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s8Fhd5"&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; buy an FDA-approved kit outside of your insurer’s approved retailer network; your insurance company is required to reimburse those purchases at a rate of $12 per test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WiPybb"&gt;If you ordered a COVID test kit online before January 15th but didn’t receive it until after, you may still be covered. Either check with your insurer, or submit the form with proof of purchase and delivery, and hope for the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L9pjb7"&gt;The requirement covers eight tests per person — not eight kits. So if your kit contains two or more tests (and many do), then keep that in mind when submitting your claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="P862Xd"&gt;Unfortunately, this leaves Medicare and Medicaid health insurance recipients — and those who don’t have insurance — pretty much out in the cold. The government is now providing four free test kits per month per household if you sign up for them, but that isn’t going to go very far if you have more than a couple of people in your household and a need to test frequently. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services, “State Medicaid and CHIP programs are required to cover FDA-authorized at-home COVID-19 tests,” but the rules can vary by state, and you’ll have to contact your local office for more info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UaoEz"&gt;Finally, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/coronavirus/testing-supplies"&gt;the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA&lt;/a&gt;), HRSA- and Medicare-supported health clinics are being supplied with at-home test kits to distribute; again, you will need to check with your local clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edOJ6t"&gt;You can find more information for reimbursements from the &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/how-to-get-your-at-home-OTC-COVID-19-test-for-free"&gt;Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfTFkf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 11:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Information added to clarify the availability of test kits for participants in Medicaid and CHIP programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07Niyz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Craig of the Creek’s getting a spinoff, a new movie, and a fifth season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xUjQsNR2JVV8YK3gIm9qIcw4Us=/229x0:1545x877/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70411687/Craig_of_the_Creek_Key_Art.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRsAMT"&gt;Though the newest season of Cartoon Network’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/craig-of-the-creeks-world-of-summertime-wonder-is-getti-1834568544"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig of the Creek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;only just picked back up earlier this week, the network’s already decided that it wants to see much, much more of Craig, the rest of the Johnson family, and the other Creek Kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeKSKL"&gt;In a move that’s sure to calm fans who can never be certain if and when these shows are coming back, Cartoon Network has just announced that &lt;em&gt;Craig of the Creek &lt;/em&gt;has been renewed for a fifth season that will continue to follow the adventures of Craig (Philip Solomon), Kelsey (Noël Wells), and J.P. (H. Michael Croner) as they discover new depths of the creek they call a second home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fO0iVo"&gt;With a whole new half of the Creek suddenly becoming accessible to Craig and the gang in the show’s last season, &lt;em&gt;Craig of the Creek&lt;/em&gt;’s been hinting at the introduction of even more characters with fresh ideas about how best to imagine the shared space as something more than the woods around their neighborhood. Though &lt;em&gt;Craig of the Creek&lt;/em&gt;’s core cast of characters is going to have a hand in how everyone’s understanding of the creek &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/craig-of-the-creek-turned-pokemon-into-an-important-lif-1837669116"&gt;continues to evolve&lt;/a&gt;, the larger &lt;em&gt;Craig of the Creek &lt;/em&gt;franchise is also about to go through a growth spurt thanks to a new spinoff series and origin film.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S6vDr6uafqFODd-eMV3R7imbxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23180673/Jessica_s_Big_Little_World_Key_Art.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Key art for Jessica’s Little Big World.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EUVEoE"&gt;With Craig’s younger sister Jessica (Lucia Cunningham) finally being old enough to go to preschool, she’s also ready to become the star of &lt;em&gt;Jessica’s Little Big World&lt;/em&gt;, her own series co-created and executive produced by Matt Burnett, Ben Levin, and Tiffany Ford that explores the world from Jessica’s unique perspective. Promotional art for &lt;em&gt;Jessica’s Little Big World &lt;/em&gt;appears to depict Jessica alongside a talking version of her beloved stuffed animal, Small Uncle, as well as a curiously different (read: older, and more together) version of the Creek Kid Wren, alluding to how many things about the series are depicted as Jessica sees them rather than as they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIu6HD"&gt;In addition to &lt;em&gt;Jessica’s Little Big World&lt;/em&gt;, Cartoon Network also announced that &lt;em&gt;Craig of The Creek: The Movie&lt;/em&gt;, an animated feature detailing Craig’s earliest days as the new kid in the neighborhood, has been greenlit for production and is slated to premiere on both Cartoon Network proper and HBO Max. While there’s currently no word on when &lt;em&gt;Jessica’s Little Big World &lt;/em&gt;will debut, both &lt;em&gt;Craig of the Creek: The Movie &lt;/em&gt;and the show’s fifth season are slated to premiere sometime in 2023. &lt;em&gt;Craig of the Creek&lt;/em&gt;’s current season is now airing on Cartoon Network ahead of the whole season coming on HBO Max on February 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
