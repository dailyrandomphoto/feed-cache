    <title>Japan puts new restrictions on stablecoins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpSDQonmGGUdue_GtNEbnqGXhQ8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237350/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocfEBj"&gt;Japan is proposing new restrictions that would only allow banks and wire transfer services to issue stablecoins, first reported by &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Stablecoins-to-face-new-restrictions-in-Japan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5kUb1"&gt;Stablecoins are a type of digital currency that’s pegged to an external asset, like a fiat currency, gold, or other investments, in an attempt to keep the coin at a stable price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"&gt;Tether is one example&lt;/a&gt; of a stablecoin, and it’s no stranger to controversy. In October, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728253/tether-41-million-misleading-statements-fiat-currency-bitfinex-cftc"&gt;was fined $41 million&lt;/a&gt; for old claims that each token was backed 1-to-1 by its cash reserves — according to the CFTC, “Tether reserves were not ‘fully backed’ the majority of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pjn6jK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This follows similar plans to regulate stablecoins in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CaI2Ay"&gt;The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to introduce the legislation in 2022, following similar plans to regulate stablecoins in the US. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"&gt;the US Treasury Department encouraged Congress&lt;/a&gt; to pass legislation that would prevent any other entities besides banks from issuing the currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqNPnX"&gt;The Treasury cites that this would help stave off “runs” in which people start cashing out coins all at once in fear that the issuer of the currency may go under, potentially destabilizing other financial markets as a result. Shortly after, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that the agencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800740/cryptocurrency-us-banking-regulation-clarification-financial-institutions-stablecoins"&gt;planned to clarify the rules and regulations&lt;/a&gt; surrounding cryptocurrencies in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptiKc7"&gt;In addition to the limitations on issuing stablecoins, Japan’s FSA also intends to tighten other rules. The agency will oversee wallet providers that engage in stablecoin transactions and require them to follow certain security protocols, like reporting any suspicious activity and verifying users’ identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaMej4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/consortium-japan-firms-test-launch-digital-currency-nikkei-2021-11-23/"&gt;Japan also plans on launching a yen-based cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. The currency — which may be called DCJPY — will be backed by bank transactions and is supposed to expedite large transfers of funds between companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund commits another $443 million to climate justice and conservation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Week NYC Leaders Reception" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRcwrLPWPM5oLV6scd9IFOHD2N4=/0x144:4428x3096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237330/1341676182.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k9nzvz"&gt;On Monday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced his Earth Fund’s &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bezos-earth-fund-announces-443-million-in-grants-to-advance-environmental-justice-conserve-and-restore-nature-and-improve-monitoring-and-accountability-301437650.html"&gt;latest round of grants&lt;/a&gt;: $443 million to be spent primarily on land conservation and restoration and efforts to reduce environmental burdens on marginalized communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcnu6C"&gt;This year, the fund has pledged more than $3 billion for similar initiatives. In 2020, Bezos promised to funnel $10 billion — about 5 percent of his current net worth — toward tackling climate change this decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="85ShzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From the beginning, the Bezos Earth Fund has faced criticism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CzR1W"&gt;From the beginning, the Bezos Earth Fund has faced &lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/bezos-earth-fund-is-an-unnatural-disaster/"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from some grassroots environmental groups. At first, Bezos primarily funded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;big-name environmental groups&lt;/a&gt; with historically white leadership and comparatively large budgets rather than supporting more Indigenous and people of color-led community groups, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;critics pointed out&lt;/a&gt;. Other criticisms focused on how Amazon, the e-commerce giant Bezos founded, continues to pollute neighborhoods and emit increasing levels of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LSxWQ"&gt;Since that early backlash, environmental justice — a movement to stop pollution and environmental degradation from disproportionately harming low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and other vulnerable groups — has become a bigger part of the Bezos Earth Fund’s messaging. The fund’s latest round of funding sets aside $130 million for 19 different organizations doing “&lt;a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/announcements"&gt;doing critical climate justice work.&lt;/a&gt;” It follows another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662529/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-150-million-climate-justice-amazon"&gt;$150 million&lt;/a&gt; pledged to climate justice groups in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YDmU7"&gt;The $130 million for environmental justice in this latest round of funding is intended to support the Biden administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/"&gt;Justice40 Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after stepping into office in January, Biden created the initiative through an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that “disadvantaged communities” receive 40 percent of the “overall benefits” of federal investments in clean energy and climate action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oHBBQ"&gt;Bezos’ grantees include a wide range of groups that either gather data to inform policymaking, help underserved communities become more resilient to climate change, support tribes and Native communities, or plan to create training programs for the Justice40 initiative. For example, GRID Alternatives, a nonprofit that works to increase access to solar power, will get $12 million for its Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEYvQF"&gt;The latest funding announcement also includes $261 million allocated to the &lt;a href="https://www.campaignfornature.org/cop15-countries-call-for-support-of-30x30-and-leaders-endorse-indigenous-rights-but-finance-commitments-fall-short"&gt;international initiative&lt;/a&gt; to conserve 30 percent of Earth’s lands and oceans by 2030. That will focus on creating, expanding, and monitoring so-called “protected areas” — mostly in the Congo Basin and Tropical Andes. According to the Bezos Earth Fund, the grants will create 11 million hectares of newly protected areas in the Congo Basin, where 70 percent of Africa’s forests are located. In the Tropical Andes, another important carbon sink for the planet, the grants will convert an estimated 48 million hectares into protected areas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NohxsA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creating, expanding, and monitoring so-called “protected areas”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8vOFe"&gt;Forests and other ecosystems are extremely important in the fight against climate change because they trap and store carbon dioxide, keeping it out of the atmosphere. But the establishment of new protected areas, especially when not carefully implemented, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770463/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-landscape-restoration-conservation-trees-indigenous-peoples"&gt;can actually harm local communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/Conservation.aspx"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.2021.1924574?journalCode=venv20"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of conservation efforts forcing Indigenous peoples off their lands to create national parks. The World Wildlife Fund, which is among Bezos’ grantees, was recently accused of failing to take responsibility for human rights abuses during a &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2021/11/wwf-distances-itself-from-rights-abuses-at-u-s-congressional-hearing/"&gt;US Congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;. That followed a &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/wwfsecretwar"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that found that WWF-funded park rangers had been accused of murder, torture, and rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQtrxp"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund says the newly protected areas will help “secure” local communities’  rights to 24 million hectares of land. It’s also spending an additional $25 million to kick off a new kind of “global mechanism” that could secure “support” for Indigenous peoples and local communities. Forests have tended to fare better under their care, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/6/3015"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows. There’s also an additional $51 million to restore landscapes in the US and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAFkTp"&gt;Closer to home for Bezos, Amazon was implicated in a recent report as playing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808388/amazon-target-port-congestion-pollution-maritime-shipping"&gt;“outsized” role&lt;/a&gt; in port congestion and associated shipping pollution along the west coast of the US. And despite Amazon’s commitments to address climate change, the company’s carbon footprint &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/amazon-says-carbon-emissions-rose-19percent-in-2020.html"&gt;grew by nearly 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/pdfBuilderDownload?name=amazon-sustainability-2020-report"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony cameras are getting harder to buy due to the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1XqwCIWZ8cTMFa_NikQZqRAsbS8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237015/bfarsace_290921_4781_01963.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Ve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmWJZ6"&gt;The global chip shortage has claimed yet another camera from Sony’s lineup. This time, Sony is suspending orders for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702421/sony-alpha-zv-e10-review-vlogging-camera-test-price-specs"&gt;ZV-E10, a mirrorless vlogging camera&lt;/a&gt; that the company released in August, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/3172922224/another-one-bites-the-dust-sony-suspends-orders-of-its-zv-e10-camera-citing-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Photography Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vohSjp"&gt;Sony announced the camera’s suspension in a post &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20211203.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it will no longer sell the ZV-E10 on its store or through any of its distributors for the time being. “With regard to digital imaging products, parts procurement is delayed due to the effects of global semiconductor shortages,” a translation of Sony’s notice reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="khLg1v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is far from the only device that Sony has temporarily discontinued this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkpVRL"&gt;Unfortunately, this is far from the only device that Sony has temporarily discontinued this year. In November, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20211119.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony stopped selling&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/30/7460095/sony-a7-ii-full-frame-camera-review"&gt;A7 II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266143/sony-a6400-review-mirrorless-compact-vlogging-camera"&gt;A6400&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836658/sony-a6600-a6100-camera-aps-c-mirrorless-price-specs-features"&gt;A1600&lt;/a&gt; series cameras, along with the ECM-B1M shotgun mic and PXW-Z190 camcorder. Sony also put the Handycam HDR-CX680 camcorder on hold &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20201203.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt;. The Sony A9 also &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/08/13/the-original-sony-alpha-9-appears-to-have-been-discontinued/"&gt;appears to be discontinued&lt;/a&gt; — or just in very short supply — as it’s listed as “No longer available” on both &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa9.html%3Futm_source%3Drflaid67085&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1333228-REG%2Fsony_ilce_9_b_alpha_a9_mirrorless_digital.html%3FfromDisList%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for the &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/08/31/sony-alpha-7r-ii-appears-finally-discontinued-after-6-years/"&gt;six-year-old Sony A7R II&lt;/a&gt;, which is also listed as unavailable on &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa7r2.html&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-alpha-a7r-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black%2F9591139.p&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In June, &lt;a href="https://www.nikon-image.com/products/info/2021/0629_02.html"&gt;Nikon stopped including the EH-7P AC adapter&lt;/a&gt; with its Z7 and Z7 II cameras, as it just doesn’t have enough parts to go around. &lt;a href="https://cweb.canon.jp/eos/info/supply-announcement2007/"&gt;Canon has also announced&lt;/a&gt; shipping delays of up to “half a year” when you order its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673196/canon-eos-r3-camera-price-specs-release-date-announced"&gt;EOS R3&lt;/a&gt;, while shipping delays also hit Fujifilm for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21517015/fujifilm-x-s10-camera-vlogging-price-specs-features"&gt;X-S10&lt;/a&gt; and some of its other camera gear earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this data analysis that uncovers predictive policing’s flawed algorithm</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYcDD8kvfME-vk0me7AwZ69oKHs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236862/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmC131"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-we-determined-predictive-policing-software-dispropo-1848139456"&gt;released a deep-dive look&lt;/a&gt; into the data collection process behind &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-1848138977"&gt;its co-reported investigation with &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into PredPol, a software company specializing in predictive policing (hence the name, which it has since changed to Geolitica) through machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMG2zl"&gt;PredPol’s algorithm is supposed to make predictions based on existing crime reports. However, since crimes aren’t equally reported everywhere, the readings it provides to law enforcement could simply copy the biases in reporting over each area. If police use this to decide where to patrol, they could end up over-policing areas that don’t need a larger presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lekE1l"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;evaluated the areas, they found that the places PredPol’s software targeted for increased patrols “were more likely to be home to Blacks, Latinos, and families that would qualify for the federal free and reduced lunch program.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0qWNhi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;23 of the 38 law enforcement agencies tracked are no longer PredPol customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nOUYix"&gt;Even as police tactics evolved to include crime and arrest data, there has been a historical disparity in how these tactics affect communities of color. As &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out in its analysis, in New York in the 1990s, researchers at the time found that the methods reduced crime without simply displacing it to other areas. However, the approach included tactics like stop-and-frisk, which have been criticized as violations of civil rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMJFmY"&gt;PredPol’s algorithm &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwbag4/academics-confirm-major-predictive-policing-algorithm-is-fundamentally-flawed"&gt;has already been looked into&lt;/a&gt; and criticized by academics more than once. As &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;quoted Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a member of the board of directors for ACLU Utah, in 2019: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="21ByOF"&gt;“Because this data is collected as a by-product of police activity, predictions made on the basis of patterns learned from this data do not pertain to future instances of crime on the whole,” Venkatasubramanian’s study notes. “In this sense, predictive policing is aptly named: it is predicting future policing, not future crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pyKzAm"&gt;Still, there hasn’t been an investigation as thorough as this one. This investigation used figures retrieved from public data available via the web. According to &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, they found an unsecured cloud database linked from the Los Angeles Police Department’s website. That data contained millions of predictions stretching back several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fwBgP"&gt;Besides supposedly predicting individual crimes, a 2018 report by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17285058/predictive-policing-predpol-pentagon-ai-racial-bias"&gt;looked into  Pentagon-funded research by PredPol’s founder Jeff Brantingham about using the software to predict gang-related crime&lt;/a&gt;. The former University of California-Los Angeles anthropology professor adapted earlier research in forecasting battlefield casualties in Iraq to create the platform, and the paper — “Partially Generative Neural Networks for Gang Crime Classification with Partial Information” — raised concern over the ethical implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acDZjQ"&gt;Critics said this approach could do more harm than good. “You’re making algorithms off a false narrative that’s been created for people — the gang documentation thing is the state defining people according to what they believe ... When you plug this into the computer, every crime is gonna be gang-related,” activist Aaron Harvey told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wo8lG7"&gt;Relying on some algorithms can work magic for some industries, but their impact can come at a real human cost. With bad data or the wrong parameters, things can go wrong quickly, even in circumstances that are less fraught than policing.  Look no further than Zillow recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760080/zillow-offers-home-selling-ibuyer-wind-down-excess-inventory-losses-financial-results"&gt;having to shut down&lt;/a&gt; its house-flipping operation after losing hundreds of millions of dollars despite the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758176/zillow-offers-ibuyer-housing-market-inventory-investors-real-estate"&gt;pricing models and automation&lt;/a&gt;” it thought would provide an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPZufv"&gt;Overall, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-1848138977"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting&lt;/a&gt; is a good consideration of how significantly predictive algorithms can affect the people unknowingly targeted by them. The &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-we-determined-predictive-policing-software-dispropo-1848139456"&gt;accompanying analysis&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; provides relevant data insight while giving readers a behind-the-scenes look into these measures. The report indicates that 23 of the 38 law enforcement agencies tracked are no longer PredPol customers, despite initially signing up for it to help distribute crime-stopping resources. Perhaps by using methods that build transparency and trust on both sides, law enforcement could spend less time on tech that leads to pieces like this, which highlights the exact opposite approach. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n38PYV"&gt;Ready. Steady. Go. If you’re still looking for a PlayStation 5, Walmart Plus members will be able to queue up for the console beginning at 12PM EST on Wednesday, December 8th. Walmart will open the digital queue for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard Playstation 5 ($500&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-less, digital-only version ($400)&lt;/a&gt;. This paywall doesn’t necessarily improve your chances of snagging a console but is currently the only way to be in the running at this particular retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjPdLk"&gt;You have to be logged into your Walmart Plus account to even attempt to add a Playstation 5 to your cart, so if you haven’t done so already, make sure you log in ahead of time and have your credentials saved to keep things moving along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lICTr"&gt;If you aren’t already a Walmart Plus member, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%2Fplans%3Fdirect%3Dtrue%26returnurl%3D%25252Fip%25252FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%25252F987823383" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll need to sign up for this $13 / month subscription service&lt;/a&gt; in order to be eligible for this restock.

    <title>Meta has a ‘moral obligation’ to make its mental health research transparent, scientists say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hOeIVsv7vTIwmRWYzzXl6WFQ8Ls=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236696/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sNwlP"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/an-open-letter-to-mark-zuckerberg/"&gt;an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; published Monday, a group of academics called for Meta to be more transparent about its research into how Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp affect the mental health of children and adolescents. The letter calls for the company to allow independent reviews of its internal work, contribute data to external research projects, and set up an independent scientific oversight group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfpCYB"&gt;“You and your organizations have an ethical and moral obligation to align your internal research on children and adolescents with established standards for evidence in mental health science,” the letter, signed by researchers from universities around the world, reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQddkI"&gt;The open letter comes after leaks from Facebook revealed some data from the company’s internal research, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; Instagram was linked with anxiety and body image issues for some teenage girls. The research released, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749357/facebook-mental-health-research-tobacco"&gt;is limited&lt;/a&gt; and relied on subjective information collected through interviews. While this strategy can produce useful insights, it can’t prove that social media caused any of the mental health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICdkZu"&gt;The information available so far appears to show that the studies Facebook researchers conducted&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;don’t meet the standards academic researchers use to conduct trials, the new open letter said. The information available also isn’t complete, the authors noted — Meta hasn’t made its research methods or data public, so it can’t be scrutinized by independent experts. The authors called for the company to allow independent review of past and future research, which would include releasing research materials and data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz9GMw"&gt;The letter also asked Meta to contribute its data to ongoing independent research efforts on the mental health of adolescents. It’s a longstanding frustration that big tech companies don’t release data, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594178/apple-watch-data-research-heart-rate-reliability"&gt;makes it&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; for external researchers to scrutinize and understand their products. “It will be impossible to identify and promote mental health in the 21st century if we cannot study how young people are interacting online,” the authors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gO1JM"&gt;The company likely has the data on platform usage and other user behavior to show the ways its platforms do or do not affect the mental health of kids and teens, Kaveri Subrahmanyam, a developmental psychologist at California State University, Los Angeles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749357/facebook-mental-health-research-tobacco"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this fall&lt;/a&gt;.  “Why are they not releasing the data that they have that shows the clicks and other behavior? I think they should be inviting researchers who have that expertise, and giving them that data and letting them do that analysis,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDgw75"&gt;The open letter also called on Meta to establish an independent scientific trust to evaluate any risks to mental health from the use of platforms like Facebook and Instagram and to help implement “truly evidence-based solutions for online risks on a world-wide scale.” The trust could be similar to the existing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;Facebook Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the company with content moderation decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQsP37"&gt;Internal research available from Meta at this point cannot conclusively say if or how social media platforms affect mental health, but the leaked findings — coupled with other research on social media — raise enough concerning issues to warrant further investigation through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749357/facebook-mental-health-research-tobacco"&gt;more rigorous research&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help understand the relationship. Understanding how life online affects kids and teenagers is a critical question, the authors of the open letter note. But the secrecy with which Meta has navigated research so far has “somewhat predictably” engendered skepticism from the research community, which prioritizes transparency, and left other stakeholders (like lawmakers and parents) concerned, the authors of the open letter wrote. Taking the steps the authors outline could help clear up those issues and contribute to a more complete picture of mental health online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy6zrD"&gt;“If the right scientific and ethical tools were in place, data collected by Meta could inform how we understand digital technology use and its influence on mental health in unprecedented ways,” the letter reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4MIXa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok considers monetization and creator retention in judging recommendation algorithm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sXSc_dSkqVesMqpaV3Tn-uZShws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236678/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJkVsg"&gt;TikTok’s much-vaunted video algorithm is designed around two things: getting users to stick around and getting users to come back. That’s according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/media/tiktok-algorithm.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;a report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reviewed a leaked copy of an internal TikTok document summarizing how the system works. The report offers a rare look into one of the most discussed algorithms in tech right now, and it reveals some considerations — like retaining creators and ensuring they make money — that may not be obvious choices when building a video feed meant to keep viewers tuned in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkoFl1"&gt;To keep users watching and coming back, TikTok considers four main objectives, according to the&lt;em&gt; Times: &lt;/em&gt;user value, long-term user value, creator value, and platform value. One way that plays out is the algorithm prioritizing a diversity of content rather than overwhelming users with one single topic they might love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqv9JF"&gt;“If a user likes a certain kind of video, but the app continues to push the same kind to him, he would quickly get bored and close the app,” the document reads, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. To avoid that, the app might show a “forced recommendation” to present something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1fNPN1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The leaker was concerned with videos leading to self-harm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RuvyFI"&gt;The document presents what is supposed to be a simplified version of TikTok’s formula for what people like and what it should play. It roughly breaks down to a combination of likes, comments, watch time on a video, and whether a video was played, according to the report. There are some variables in the equation that aren’t spelled out, but my read on it is that TikTok likely weights different interactions so that some are valued more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4gpGR"&gt;TikTok also puts a real focus on creators when judging the value of its For You feed, according to a flow chart from the document that was recreated by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. It shows TikTok considering “creation quality,” which is judged by publish rate, creator retention, and creator monetization. There isn’t further detail on how TikTok judges creator retention and monetization, but it would appear to indicate that whether creators are successful is a real consideration when determining the “quality of videos” in the For You feed. That said, whether creators make money isn’t an input to the algorithm, TikTok spokesperson Jamie Favazza tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Instead, it’s an outcome of TikTok’s optimization for user satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqrpqh"&gt;For its part, TikTok has not been entirely opaque about all of this in the past. In blog posts, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296044/tiktok-for-you-page-algorithm-sides-engagement-data-creators-trends-sounds"&gt;detailed the basics&lt;/a&gt; of how its feed works — comments and what accounts you follow can impact recommendations — and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/11/21430822/tiktok-transparency-visit-tour-algorithms-for-you-page"&gt;gave &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;a look inside&lt;/a&gt; its “Transparency and Accountability Center” last year, which spoke to the company’s concerns about issues like filter bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpPFks"&gt;Today’s report shouldn’t dispel concerns about filter bubbles or the app driving users toward problematic content. In fact, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;says the document was leaked by a TikTok employee who was concerned about the app leading to self-harm. In the past, reporters have spotted the app presenting user-generated content &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cameronwilson/tiktok-eating-disorder-videos-algorithm-for-you-page"&gt;promoting eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.huckmag.com/perspectives/tiktokers-are-using-secret-hashtags-to-discuss-self-harm/"&gt;discussing or&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mic.com/life/people-are-cutting-themselves-on-tiktok-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it-81163126"&gt;showing self-harm&lt;/a&gt;. Because the app is so finely tuned at keeping users tuned in with content similar to videos they’ve already watched, it’s easy to see how quickly the network could become problematic if not properly moderated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIGpHi"&gt;Favazza says TikTok considers “a range of engagement signals” when determining what to show people. “We continue to invest in new ways to customize content preferences, automatically skip videos that aren’t relevant or age-appropriate, and remove violations of our Community Guidelines,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFaw9K"&gt;Mostly, though, the leak provides a fascinating insight into one of the most-discussed black boxes on the internet — how TikTok decides what to show you video after video. The details presented here, like the recommendation formula, are “highly simplified,” the document says. But it indicates that the complicated ways major social platforms craft their algorithms could be broken down into clear objectives and shared with the public to provide at least some sense of why we’re seeing whatever it is we see.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota will build a $1.29 billion electric vehicle battery factory in North Carolina</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEXE1ZNvijykdTq8d8d5_PJp06s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236362/akrales_180328_2351_0623.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bql2JV"&gt;Toyota will build a $1.29 billion battery factory in North Carolina in an effort to bring some of its electric vehicle supply chain to the US. The news comes on the heels of Toyota’s announcement that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662236/toyota-battery-investment-electric-cars-hybrids-2030"&gt;invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech&lt;/a&gt; over the next decade, including a $9 billion investment in production, as it attempts to electrify its vehicle lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="encq9M"&gt;Toyota plans on spreading the $1.29 billion for the new factory over the next decade, but production at the facility is scheduled to begin in 2025, said Chris Reynolds, chief administrative officer for Toyota Motor North America. In the first year, Toyota plans on producing 1.2 million battery packs for its upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, Reynolds said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dCNjOu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota has said it will create 1,750 new jobs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOxx2t"&gt;“This investment, which I believe is so far the largest private capital investment in North Carolina history... will create at least 1,750 new jobs and help us develop and localize automotive battery production,” Reynolds said during a press conference, “which will pave the way for battery electric vehicles built here in the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcdh9a"&gt;The factory won’t come without its costs to the taxpayers. &lt;a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article256372267.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina’s Economic Investment Committee approved a $438.7 million tax incentive package to encourage Toyota to build in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c28VTd"&gt;Toyota’s battery factory is the latest new facility planned as car companies scramble to ramp up production of EVs. Toyota’s first long-range EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752539/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-steering-yoke-solar-roof"&gt;the BZ4X compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to be released in mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0WCjP"&gt;Ford and South Korean battery manufacturer SK Innovation are spending $11.4 billion on several new factories in Tennessee and Kentucky, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; is planning four new battery factories in the US with partner LG Chem. In Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; is aiming to have six battery cell production plants operating by 2030. And Tesla is close to finishing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;battery factory in Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, which would produce 250GWh — roughly equivalent to the current world battery cell production capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHhOwU"&gt;Globally, battery production is expected to grow from 95.3GWh in 2020 to 410.5GWh in 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhlLN7"&gt;The news is also set against the backdrop of fierce lobbying in Washington, DC, over the future of the federal EV tax credit, which currently provides shaves $7,500 off the purchase price of some electric vehicles. Congressional Democrats have proposed increasing the credit to $12,500 for purchases of electric vehicles made in the US by unionized workers, triggering a backlash from non-union companies like Tesla and Toyota. The Japanese automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qll6xa/toyota_full_page_ad_in_the_wsj_screams_antiunion/"&gt;run full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; accusing President Joe Biden and the Democrats of “play[ing] politics with the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoE9SY"&gt;Although the company was an early leader in gas-electric hybrid cars with the Prius, Toyota reportedly viewed hybrids as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toyota-whiffed-on-electric-vehicles-now-trying-slow-their-rise/"&gt;stopgap measure&lt;/a&gt; until hydrogen fuel cells became competitive. Now, the company is playing catch-up with the likes of Nissan and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594235/toyota-lobbying-dc-ev-congress-biden-donation"&gt;reportedly lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to slow the US’s transition to electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MlTPA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA announces 10 new astronaut candidates who could fly to the Moon someday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ve-ZzhSLL1Vm8-kee60n2uinazY=/0x630:9448x6929/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70236216/jsc2021e062834.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(L to R): Nichole Ayers, Christopher Williams, Luke Delaney, Jessica Wittner, Anil Menon, Marcos Berríos, Jack Hathaway, Christina Birch, Deniz Burnham, and Andre Douglas.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qxUJ3"&gt;Today, NASA announced the selection of its newest class of astronauts: six men and four women chosen from more than 12,000 people who applied to the space agency in March of 2020. Once they train and become full astronauts, these selectees have some exciting spaceflight opportunities ahead of them, potentially including flights to the Moon someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfhXHd"&gt;The astronauts announced today are part of the so-called Artemis Generation. The name is a reference to NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to send the first woman and the first person of color to the lunar surface as early as 2025 (a landing date that is considered incredibly ambitious). The program calls for launching astronauts on a series of flights into deep space on NASA’s new massive rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, eventually culminating with humans landing on the Moon once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiqhX"&gt;“These NASA astronauts will plan, train, and fly missions to the International Space Station and to the moon under Artemis, and eventually onto Mars,” Vanessa Wyche, director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, said during a presentation announcing the astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wBXYuo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was the Apollo generation, and that did so much for so many. Now it’s the Artemis generation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2qgU3L"&gt;NASA has yet to assign crews to any of the missions associated with the Artemis program, so technically the flights are still up for grabs. However, in December of 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166077/nasa-artemis-astronauts-18-first-woman-moon-mike-pence-space-council"&gt;NASA revealed the Artemis Team&lt;/a&gt;, 18 astronauts already part of the space agency who could potentially be selected to fly on Artemis missions. Presumably, the candidates selected today will join the pool that NASA chooses from. Aside from lunar missions, NASA is still regularly flying astronauts to and from the International Space Station on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. Eventually, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner will also take astronauts to the ISS when it’s deemed ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQn4gL"&gt;But before the new recruits can fly, they have to train. The astronauts will go through roughly two years of training at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, which includes flying in the agency’s fleet of T-38 jet aircraft, spacewalk training, robotics work, and more. If that all goes well, they’ll eventually graduate to full astronaut status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lClBju"&gt;“Today, we welcome 10 new explorers — 10 members of the Artemis generation,” NASA administrator Bill Nelson said during the ceremony. “It was the Apollo generation, and that did so much for so many. Now it’s the Artemis generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeGTK3"&gt;The new class of astronaut candidates includes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XSbpOU"&gt;Nichole Ayers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J3vPfy"&gt;Marcos Berríos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="flA9GV"&gt;Christina Birch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="odMiuZ"&gt;Deniz Burnham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I3JQTW"&gt;Luke Delaney&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7hQbqy"&gt;Andre Douglas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GqE3Vz"&gt;Jack Hathaway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6o9mKO"&gt;Anil Menon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ypjFLX"&gt;Christopher Williams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8drhGs"&gt;Jessica Wittner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="q6qu8b"&gt;Most of the group has some kind of military experience, with various members currently or formerly enrolled in the US Air Force and Navy. Burnham, meanwhile, is a drilling engineer from Alaska, while Menon was recently working as a medical officer at SpaceX. Ayers is also one of just a few women currently flying the F-22 for the Air Force, according to NASA, and she “led the first ever all-woman formation of the aircraft in combat.” Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-new-astronaut-recruits-to-train-for-future-missions"&gt;astronaut candidates’ backgrounds here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpAEld"&gt;In order to be considered as a NASA astronaut, candidates must be a US citizen and have a master’s degree in a STEM-related field from an accredited university. On top of that, applicants must have at least 1,000 hours of piloting a jet aircraft or at least three years of experience in a STEM-related field. With all those requirements in hand, finalists must then pass a NASA physical before being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSLbjf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7UwMX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro (13-inch) review: a travel buddy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great laptop at the right size&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W2kcUO"&gt;When I reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419899/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review"&gt;15-inch Galaxy Book Pro 360&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, I concluded that it was great — but that its somewhat unique combination of a 15-inch OLED screen, integrated graphics, and a stylus at a fairly premium price point made its audience fairly specific. The package it offers is somewhat unusual in the 15-inch space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmuLz3"&gt;The 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro is clearly the laptop I was looking for. Like many of Samsung’s Galaxy Books, this device has a thin and light chassis, a standout screen, and excellent battery life. Unlike many other Galaxy Books, it doesn’t come with significant compromises for those benefits, and it doesn’t cost a fortune — &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/computing/galaxy-books/galaxy-book-pro/galaxy-book-pro--13---256gb--mystic-silver-np930xdb-kh3us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my test unit is $999&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with many of the benefits that we’d expect from a premium business laptop, but also with a consumer-accessible price tag. It’s a package of business-ready features that I’m happy to see finally available in the mainstream sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6T1UT0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10905403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="qG6JyJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905411"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XUZRU"&gt;In many ways, the Galaxy Book Pro is a similar package to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. It’s attractive, well built, and comfortable to use. But there are a couple reasons shoppers might want to go for the Galaxy Book instead. The first is its size and weight. My test unit is just 0.44 inches thick — almost as thin as many smartphones — and 1.92 pounds. This ties it with the &lt;a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/expertbook-b9-b9450-11th-gen-intel.html"&gt;Asus ExpertBook B9&lt;/a&gt; (which is close to twice the price of my test unit) as one of the absolute lightest laptops in the world. For some quick context, the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-4-13-5-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-512gb-solid-state-drive-latest-model-matte-black%2F6455204.p%3FskuId%3D6455204&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; is almost a pound heavier, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmacbook-pro-14-laptop-apple-m1-pro-chip-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-latest-model-space-gray%2F6450854.p%3FskuId%3D6450854&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;close to the weight of&lt;/a&gt; two of these things stacked on top of each other. You will not notice this thing in your bag; carrying it feels like carrying a small tablet around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8VPvc"&gt;The second is the screen. The Galaxy Book Pro is one of few 13-inch OLED laptops you can buy (and some of the others out there have… &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt;), and one of the more affordable OLED devices out there, period. Note that this is a 1920 x 1080 OLED screen — it’s visibly more pixel-y than the 4K panels that you’ll often see on OLED workstations. But that hardly ruins the experience. Blacks are black, and colors are rich — the Galaxy Book covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 100 percent of the sRGB gamut. And, thankfully, I didn’t see any screen wobble (which was an issue I had with the convertible Galaxy Book). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb03YE"&gt;The screen’s main downside is that it’s a bit dim for this price point (as OLEDs often are), maxing out at 314 nits in my testing. This wasn’t a major problem in use, however — even around medium brightness, the panel wasn’t kicking back a ton of glare in bright settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZs8UK"&gt;Another notable drawback is that it has the 16:9 aspect ratio, which is falling out of fashion in the consumer space; the Galaxy Book’s big competitors, including the Surface Laptops, MacBooks, and XPS laptops of the world, all provide more vertical space. The screen was a bit cramped for my workload as a result, especially since it’s only 13.3 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The corner of the Galaxy Book Pro 13, closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gzKJEXi1Bt909XYhbUB266dyOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982908/akrales_211102_4817_0125.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look how thin!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6aGoQ45g7I1M0A1J92UtID5q2M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982900/akrales_211102_4817_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell me this doesn’t give you serious XPS 13 vibes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vmBCf7"&gt;The third unique thing: there’s a whole bunch of Samsung-specific software on it that will cooperate with a Samsung phone, if you have one. For example, you can quickly move things between the Galaxy Book Pro and a Galaxy phone using the Quick Share feature and can sync up notes and the like as well. The sheer amount of OEM software on here is actually a bit overwhelming. I counted 14 Samsung-branded programs on this device — Samsung Flow, Samsung Studio Plus, Samsung Security, Samsung Settings, Samsung Care+, etc. — and I was never quite sure where to find specific settings and features. Those who are already plugged into the Samsung ecosystem may not have this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LXyES"&gt;One thing I did uncover in this labyrinth of apps is Studio Mode, which attempts to beautify you in real time on video calls. A little menu pops up when you turn the Galaxy Book’s camera on. There are a few different presets to choose from, which all attempt to enlarge your eyes, thin your face, and remove skin blemishes to various degrees. Without getting into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215051/fauxtography-photography-image-processing-editing-filters-reality"&gt;politics of this&lt;/a&gt;, I will note that this feature seemed effective at what it was trying to do. The only weird thing I noticed was that my face would sometimes flicker weirdly if my hand was covering part of it, possibly because the obstruction made the algorithm struggle to recognize my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13 half open, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-hjYU6a0whP7RnC7GT_mjZSgcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982904/akrales_211102_4817_0071.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid is a bit blah.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-y3p0j0xa0xZnxIZuRb6RfGGEC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982903/akrales_211102_4817_0057.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They somehow squeezed an HDMI port onto this tiny thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11SmlIpRcvuZ7b9mjd1KXh_fT3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982902/akrales_211102_4817_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And a USB-A!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="EgY8vJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPvGrD"&gt;In most other areas, the Galaxy Book Pro is a run-of-the-mill ultrabook (which means it’s quite good). It feels a lot like using a thinner, lighter XPS 13. (Samsung nailed the keyboard texture in particular — it’s eerily similar.) The trackpad is massive, with a smooth texture and an ever-so-slightly stiff click. The keyboard is on the shallow side, but I was surprised by how much I liked it — it has a very satisfying click, and I surpassed my normal typing speeds. The one category where the Galaxy Book is a bit behind top competitors is looks; the exterior has a bit of a drab vibe that I think belies the excellence of the rest of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 13 open seen from above and to the right on a brown table. The screen displays a Verge 10 graphic." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfcA4kQ1cekDSLDzo2PTyYutOTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982907/akrales_211102_4817_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, those are some real bezels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yzwWqk"&gt;My unit comes with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and a Core i5-1135G7; $1,199 gets you &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/laptops/buy/?modelCode=NP930XDB-KH2US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage and a Core i7&lt;/a&gt;. You can get it in “Mystic Silver” or “Mystic Blue” — the shades are the same price. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/laptops/buy/?modelCode=NP950XDB-KE6US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fifteen-inch models&lt;/a&gt; start at $1,099, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/2-in-1-laptops/buy/?link=galaxy-book-pro-360" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;convertible models&lt;/a&gt; (equipped with a stylus and a touchscreen) start at $1,199. The $999 tag puts my unit at the same price level as the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Laptop-4%2F946627fb12t1%3Fcrosssellid%3D%26selectedColor%3D9A9CA3%26cid%3Dmsft_web_collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt;, which swaps in an AMD Ryzen 5 processor in place of the Intel chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6reDHy"&gt;The Core i5-1135G7 is tailor-made for thin and light laptops — despite the “Pro” moniker, this Galaxy Book is not designed for intense professional workloads, and the lack of a discrete GPU means it’s not a good choice for gaming. But it is just fine for someone like me who spends most of their time hopping around a couple dozen Chrome tabs with the occasional Zoom call or Spotify stream over top. I never heard fans or felt any kind of heat, even when I was running the device on Battery Saver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIbX5c"&gt;Battery life was also good. I averaged eight hours and five minutes of work. That’s not as good as the 15-inch model, which has a slightly bigger battery, but should still get you through a full day of work, especially if you’re letting the device go to sleep rather than continuously pushing it as I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iyyWR2"&gt;My feelings on the 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro are easy to sum up: it’s the perfect travel companion. It’s light, it’s well-built, it lasts a long time, and I can see the screen outside. If I’m going on a trip, there is no other consumer laptop I’d rather have with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jSLpLp"&gt;The word “consumer” is, of course, doing a lot of work in that sentence. That’s because this combination of features &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; available in the business space and have been hallmarks of the best business laptops for years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Asus’ ExpertBook&lt;/a&gt; is close to this device’s weight and lasts significantly longer. But consumers travel, too, and they should have options that accommodate an on-the-go lifestyle without the &lt;a href="https://www.insight.com/en_US/shop/product/B9450FA-XS74/ASUS/B9450FA-XS74/ASUS-ExpertBook-B9-B9450FA-XS74---14%22---Core-i7-10510U---16-GB-RAM---512-GB-SSD/"&gt;exorbitant prices&lt;/a&gt; attached to enterprise purchases. For that reason, I’m glad the 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro exists, even if its boring aesthetic and aspect ratio mean it wouldn’t be my laptop of choice. It’s my top recommendation for anyone who goes a lot of places or anyone who just wants something really, really light. &lt;/p&gt;
