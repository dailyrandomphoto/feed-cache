    <title>Artifacts from the first COVID-19 vaccination in the US are headed to the Smithsonian</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pbxYge"&gt;The glass vial used in the first US COVID-19 vaccination has been acquired by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The museum also acquired related items including the scrubs and vaccination card of Sandra Lindsay, director of critical care nursing at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center who, on December 14th, 2020, became the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/nyregion/us-covid-vaccine-first-sandra-lindsay.html"&gt;first person in the US to receive a COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecF94d"&gt;“The urgent need for effective vaccines in the U.S. was met with unprecedented speed,” said Anthea M. Hartig, the museum’s Elizabeth MacMillan director, &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-collects-objects-first-known-us-covid-19-vaccination-effort"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. “These now historic artifacts document not only this remarkable scientific progress but represent the hope offered to millions living through the cascading crises brought on by COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmW2rZ"&gt;The announcement on Tuesday happened days before the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21156325/coronavirus-pandemic-who-declares-covid-19-outbreak-global-h1n1"&gt;declaring the outbreak a pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Since April 2020, a special task force at the museum has been seeking out objects and documentation related to COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsybbX"&gt;“We’ve had everything from offers of masks that people have made to objects related to treatment of Covid, to practitioners offering us objects related to how they’ve gone about protecting themselves or their family,” Alexandra Lord, chair of the museum’s division of medicine and science, &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/first-vial-used-us-covid-19-vaccinations-joins-smithsonian-collections-180977194/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8560k"&gt;The vial and other items are joining the museum’s collection of materials related to historic epidemics and pandemics, including objects related to the polio epidemic, the 1957 influenza pandemic, and the HIV / AIDS pandemic. Many items from the collection will be on display in a 2022 exhibition, “In Sickness and in Health.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC revenue drops nearly 90 percent in fourth quarter, but CEO remains optimistic </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AMC’s Stock Is Latest Target For Retail Investors Organized On Reddit Message Boards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ShBF7mTd1ChCTkBBg9x7ucshPDc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944942/1298998015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="feQYaJ"&gt;AMC Theaters reported another jarring but predictable loss in its &lt;a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/472643608/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-4Q-2020-earnings-press-release-20210310-1435-clean-v.f.pdf"&gt;fourth quarter earnings&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s CEO is optimistic that the theater chain will make it out of the pandemic alright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSXdGG"&gt;Revenue was down 88 percent year over year, to $162.5 million. While beating expectations, that still led to a quarterly loss of $946 million (slightly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545812/amc-theaters-financial-earnings-q3-bankruptcy-streaming-warner-bros-disney-regal#:~:text=The%20company%20posted%20a%20revenue,91%20percent%20year%20over%20year."&gt;better than the last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, though significantly worse than the $13.5 million loss AMC reported in its 2019 fourth quarter), but AMC also has more than $1 billion in cash on hand, according to CEO Adam Aron. On the tailwinds of announcements that New York City &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295880/new-york-city-movie-theaters-open-cuomo"&gt;would start to allow theaters&lt;/a&gt; to open, and studios seemingly preparing to head back to theaters, Aron is trying to find the positives while acknowledging the “most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iD3JMi"&gt;“As we sit here today, we see that vaccinations are occurring in the United States at a brisk clip, our theatres in New York City have finally opened with theatres in Los Angeles likely opening shortly as well, [and] blockbuster movie titles are currently scheduled to be released in significant quantity in the coming few months,” Aron said in a press release. “Taking these facts together, we have reason to be optimistic about AMC’s ability to get to the other side of this pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzxzy5"&gt;As noted in AMC’s earnings, part of the reason that AMC is still able to push forward and Aron feels optimistic is because of capital raised throughout 2020 and 2021. Add in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;newfound love from retail traders&lt;/a&gt; (similar to what happened with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop in late January&lt;/a&gt;), and AMC’s stock price has also somewhat rebounded over the last several weeks. Now, with announcements from President Joe Biden that nearly every American should be able to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/politics/biden-merck-johnson--johnson-vaccine/index.html"&gt;receive their vaccination by May 2021&lt;/a&gt;, studios are looking to get their blockbusters out in theaters again and AMC is hoping to bring as many moviegoers in as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFiX8u"&gt;There are still a lot of questions on the table. How has the irrevocably shortened theatrical window, brought on by companies with major studios like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355563/mulan-disney-plus-streaming-exclusive-cost-own-movies-theaters"&gt;NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia, ViacomCBS, and Disney&lt;/a&gt; possibly harmed AMC’s overall business? Will people want to rush into theaters by the summer? Could something else happen that delays everything reopening en masse once again? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsnSQj"&gt;For now, Aron is optimistic — at least in front of his company’s shareholders, investors, and analysts. The CEO will say more about the business and industry at large on the company’s earnings call this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly denies Parler’s App Store appeal, citing derogatory terms and ‘Nazi symbols’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP8YutyzG6d7B9X6LQEDp11Oglw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944888/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9cLIw"&gt;Apple has reportedly denied social media company Parler’s bid to reenter the iOS App Store, saying its platform hasn’t addressed problems with offensive content. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported the news earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, quoting a message reportedly sent on February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVsGFX"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Apple said that Parler’s &lt;a href="https://legal.parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf"&gt;latest community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; still didn’t meet its standards. “Simple searches reveal highly objectionable content, including easily identified offensive uses of derogatory terms regarding race, religion and sexual orientation, as well as Nazi symbols,” it reportedly told Parler. “For these reasons your app cannot be returned to the App Store for distribution until it complies with the guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUzW2M"&gt;Parler’s guidelines ban threats, spam, and some other categories of content. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;right-wing-friendly network’s&lt;/a&gt; policies remain permissive compared to other social platforms, and its stated goal is that “removing users or user-provided content be kept to the absolute minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6lPLq"&gt;That strategy has put it at odds with several major companies. Apple and Google both banned its app from their mobile stores in January, following the January 6th mob attack on the US Capitol. And Amazon took the site offline by suspending its web hosting agreement, saying representatives had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;raised concerns about violent threats&lt;/a&gt; preceding the attack. Parler responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech"&gt;filing suit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, although it has since relaunched on a different hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqLfmI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;also reports that Parler cut ties with its last three iOS app developers alongside four other employees. The company still maintains an Android app that can be side-loaded from outside Google’s Play Store, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284036/parler-social-network-relaunch-new-hosting"&gt;its site relaunched&lt;/a&gt; on February 15th. Parler and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nyan Cat’s creator is running an event to sell memes like Bad Luck Brian and Keyboard Cat as NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPRG7VIyYHqDAwUoZ2U7UzE2aek=/0x151:892x746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944793/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_10.01.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Kyle Craven&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DrYbxT"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;selling Nyan Cat as an NFT&lt;/a&gt;, its creator, Chris Torres, has found himself working on an even bigger event: a week-long series of auctions where classic memes are being sold on the blockchain by their original creators. Torres calls the event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/withFND/status/1369098514773381120?s=20"&gt;Memeconomy&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s hoping it’ll bring both recognition to the meme creators, as well as to the NFT space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pbr7Zh"&gt;The memes involved should be recognizable if you were on the internet in the early 2010s. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oGxggC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bad-luck-brian"&gt;Bad Luck Brian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sMRgDl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/coughing-cat"&gt;Coughing Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JsfsmJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaA_cs4WZHM"&gt;Kitty Cat Dance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vBP3cd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/scumbag-steve"&gt;Scumbag Steve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8gg1re"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ"&gt;The Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/grumpy-cat"&gt;Grumpy cats&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lp7mEC"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/me-gusta"&gt;Me Gusta face&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="UT2dKy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MEMECONOMY?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MEMECONOMY&lt;/a&gt; WEEK 1   by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NyanCat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NyanCat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6 OG memes. 1 brand new NFT. We’re seeing the rise of the meme economy on Foundation.     &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/solidbadluck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@solidbadluck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IdasCreatures?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@idascreatures&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveIbsen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@steveibsen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealGrumpyCat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@realgrumpycat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KeyboardCatReal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@keyboardcatreal&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwerkyPepe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@twerkypepe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlakeBoston617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@blakeboston617&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only on → &lt;a href="https://t.co/A7bTOLs99m"&gt;https://t.co/A7bTOLs99m&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XVaUZrDoQI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XVaUZrDoQI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Foundation (@withFND) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/withFND/status/1369098514773381120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wYG4yB"&gt;There will also be an auction of a new meme: a crossover between Twerky Pepe (a popular NFT creator) and the classic Nyan Cat. (Have you ever wanted to see thicc Nyan Cat? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PRguitarman/status/1368995286434127877?s=20"&gt;Now you can.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1zSYO"&gt;The event is already under way, and so far the first meme, Bad Luck Brain, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/badluckbrian/bad-luck-brian-4263"&gt;sold for just over $37,000&lt;/a&gt;. Coughing Cat is currently up for auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oorpn9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czbleJ"&gt;While the memes are mostly from the same era, Torres says that it’s not on purpose. “Honestly there was no real agenda” when it came to the selection of memes, he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that the original meme creators had contacted him independently. He says that he won’t be making any money off the auctions themselves, he just wanted to help get the creators set up so they could get “proper recognition” after “10 plus years without [it].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqMKT8"&gt;While NFTs are supposed to validate ownership, there’s no guarantee that the person creating an NFT owns the artwork they’re selling. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2021/03/people-are-now-making-nfts-out-of-artworks-and-tweets-without-permission/"&gt;artists talking about how their work has been stolen&lt;/a&gt; and NFT-ized, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GiphyComms/status/1369442632649310210?s=20"&gt;Giphy has tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it was looking into user content being used by NFT sites. Torres knows it’s an issue and said that he made sure that everyone he talked to about NFTs was both the actual creator of the meme and actually held the rights to it. He also said that meme theft wasn’t a new problem: “sometimes you look over and there’s a company that has your picture on a shirt and they’re making millions of dollars without even talking to you about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STrRyn"&gt;In the short term, the Memeconomy could put some cash (well, crypto) in the pockets of creators and open the doors for them to show off some recent work, if they have any. It could also work to build a community — finding friends through the process of organizing the Memeconomy event and through interactions in the NFT space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJljAt"&gt;In the long term, though, Torres thinks the meme NFTs will become collectables, and that “eventually somebody’s gonna want to have all of them” and it’ll “be a big fight to own all the memes whenever that time comes.” He said he “can’t wait to see that like a VR room with all the memes all displayed, that’s like… that would be awesome, like a grand collection of memes.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s search bar was spacing out in many web browsers today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-xnAZL7eBG_Jd2YnUS4U-bO5jU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944035/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3FtxzF"&gt;So this was a weird one: depending on the browser you’re using, your space bar may not have worked in the YouTube.com search bar for a little while today. Pressing it would make absolutely nothing happen, so your YouTube searches ended up being one long string of words. The bug seemed to be around for an hour, based on when people started sounding off about it on Twitter, but as of 3:50PM ET, the site appeared to be working correctly again on all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWb5EZ"&gt;The bug affected the desktop site, but only browsers that aren’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;based on Chrome. Firefox wouldn’t take spaces in Windows, macOS, or even Android if you requested the desktop version of the website. Safari on iPhones worked as normal, but the problems showed up on Safari on iPad — probably because iPads request the desktop site, too. Asking for the mobile version immediately fixed it there, and requesting the desktop site on an iPhone immediately broke spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxO3If"&gt;The good news is that the lack of spaces probably didn’t affect your YouTube experience much — it’s very good at understanding your intent even on long, relatively obscure searches with a bunch of words smashed together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc_-A8Cw3uRxM_L_wNGgwH1Hyh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360288/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_11.12.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s search algorithm was still able to figure it out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s00fKw"&gt;There was also another, &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more annoying bug: if you were trying to watch a video and type in the search bar at the same time, your keystrokes would end up acting as shortcuts. Pressing the space bar wouldn’t do anything in the search bar, but it would pause your video. Your “T” might show up in the search bar, but it also switched my video into theater mode. This issue is also fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typing in the search bar made many awful things happen on your screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sKc0cx"&gt;YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the issue now appears to be fixed. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2Ma6x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 10th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect that the bug appears to have been fixed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s new hockey deal will see over 1,000 NHL games stream on ESPN Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Winnipeg Jets v Toronto Maple Leafs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2b39uX6l5hPd81ou3Okebe4gDDw=/0x6:4200x2806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944447/1306372719.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Claus Andersen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nzi3W"&gt;Disney and the NHL have just signed a massive new TV rights deal for the next seven years that will see ESPN and ESPN Plus become key places to watch and stream hockey games, starting with the upcoming 2021-2022 season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcQRhB"&gt;It’s the first time that ESPN will offer NHL hockey games since its previous deal expired in 2005, and this time streaming — particularly, ESPN Plus streaming — is a huge part of that deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZjtZh"&gt;ESPN Plus is effectively replacing NHL.TV as the NHL’s out-of-market streaming service, with over 1,000 games each season available for fans to stream. ESPN and ABC will also get 25 exclusive national regular-season games each season, while 75 games a year will be exclusive to ESPN Plus and Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGXckr"&gt;Additionally, ABC will get exclusive rights to the Stanley Cup Final for four of the seven years, with the option to simultaneously broadcast those finals games on ESPN Plus and other linear ESPN networks. Furthermore, ABC and ESPN together will get to broadcast half of the NHL playoffs each season, too. (Specifically, Disney’s networks will get one of the Conference Final series and half of all the first round and second round games each year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Popl2M"&gt;The new NHL deal marks one of the biggest expansions yet for ESPN Plus when it comes to offering live sports from one of the major North American leagues, and it instantly makes the service a must-have for hockey fans across the US. The NHL deal will also offer a new wave of live sports on Hulu, thanks to the 75 games that will be exclusively broadcast on Hulu and ESPN Plus (which, unlike the other ESPN Plus games, will be available to all Hulu subscribers whether they subscribe to ESPN Plus or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlX5jc"&gt;The news comes just as Disney is &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/espn-plus-launches-hulu-1234927368/"&gt;rolling out a larger integration&lt;/a&gt; for ESPN Plus subscribers to be able to access that additional sport content within Hulu itself, which should help make it even easier for subscribers of both of those services to find the newly added NHL games when they debut this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpkkoM"&gt;ESPN Plus alone costs $5.99 per month, or it can be bundled alongside Hulu with ads and Disney Plus for $13.99 per month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I guess I have to watch ads everywhere on my $1,500 LG TV now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9a-td2wJMV9A1q2HrIMY3G_-Sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944432/DSCF3184.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nSl5e"&gt;This afternoon, I was updating the streaming apps on my 2020 LG CX OLED TV, something I do from time to time, but today was different. Out of nowhere, I saw (and heard) an ad for Ace Hardware start playing in the lower-left corner. It autoplayed with sound without any action on my part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ltzf2Q"&gt;Now I’m fully aware that it’s not unusual to see ads placed around a TV’s home screen or main menu. LG, Samsung, Roku, Vizio, and others are all in on this game. We live in an era when smart TVs can automatically recognize what you’re watching, and TV makers are building nice ad businesses for themselves with all of the data that gets funneled in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l78Tro"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just got served a legit commercial while updating the apps on my LG OLED TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This isn’t the future I signed up for. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TmQflsCxsl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TmQflsCxsl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Welch (@chriswelch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswelch/status/1369733357756686349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f05LaU"&gt;But this felt pretty egregious even by today’s standards. A random, full-on commercial just popping up in LG’s app store? Is there no escape from this stuff? We’re just going to cram ads into every corner of a TV’s software, huh? Imagine if an autoplay ad started up while you were updating the apps on your smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4rsTQ"&gt;The Ace spot wasn’t particularly annoying — it was over in 15 seconds — nor did it feel targeted at me or creepy. It’s really the placement that feels like a step too far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwP49d"&gt;This stuff can come off as invasive, but it’s also partially what’s steadily brought the prices down on even high-end TVs. I got this 55-inch CX on sale for like $1,400, and it’s pretty much the best TV on the market for next-gen gaming. But even if this beautiful panel came cheaper than it might have &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; ads plastered in random places, the level of ad infiltration on display here is still disheartening to see. LG recently announced it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;licensing webOS to other TV brands&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe the company is trying to see how far it can push things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3h9b"&gt;I guess I can always cut the TV’s internet connection and stick to a streaming stick or my Xbox Series X if the autoplay commercials keep popping up everywhere. Or maybe I can opt out of a setting somewhere to end the barrage. Some people aren’t bothered by this stuff, but if you are, check out &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/gn7fw5/ysk_if_you_own_a_samsung_smart_tv_that_has_ads/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;this excellent Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you fight back and block some of the domains that these TVs phone home to for their ads. A lot of people on Twitter also &lt;a href="https://pi-hole.net/"&gt;pointed me to Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt; as a fix. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gnosia is like a single-player Among Us for the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Ns2e_IP3H-aElBO-R0vZQcXKhA=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944339/01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xODgVb"&gt;Deduction games like &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;are exciting in part because of the human element — finding those signs that someone is lying, or doing your best to conceal your true identity while everyone scrutinizes you. The experience changes dramatically depending on who you’re playing with and how committed they are to their role. That’s what makes G&lt;em&gt;nosia&lt;/em&gt; so intriguing. The core idea is the same, as you’re either trying to suss out who the enemy is or disguise yourself as one. But there’s a huge difference: in &lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; you play entirely by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9NMZv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as a deduction game transformed into a visual novel. You play as a crew member on a spaceship, one that has been infected by an alien race known as the gnosia. While everyone looks human (well, except for the talking dolphin), one or more is actually an alien who wants nothing more than to kill the rest of the crew. The gnosia only attack at night, and each day the crew will hold a vote on who is most suspicious; the person chosen will then be placed in a cold sleep in hopes of preventing a death. This process continues until either the threat has been eliminated or the gnosia take over the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgQwlS"&gt;So how do you figure out if a computer-controlled character is lying? These voting sequences make up the heart of &lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt;, and they consist of a lot of dialogue. Before actually voting, everyone will voice their opinions and concerns. Some of the crew will have specific roles — like a doctor who can tell if someone is actually a gnosia — but of course they could be lying about that as well. Your job is to pay close attention to what people say, as well as how often, to figure out the truth. Are they constantly trying to divert blame elsewhere? Are they suspiciously quiet? At the same time, you have to be careful not to draw too much attention to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KNCtW-TRsWyGrvqswMwSCNkRuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360142/03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QUMDuF"&gt;One of the more interesting narrative twists employed by developer Petit Depotto in &lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; is that you and the rest of the crew relive the same day over and over. The variables change each loop, including your own, essentially randomizing things. Sometimes you’re aiming to save everyone, other times you’re plotting as a gnosia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzpXiJ"&gt;On the one hand, this leads to a lot of repetition. You’ll be reading through the same lines of dialogue regularly and living through essentially the same day more than 100 times. But the game does a good job of slowly introducing new elements to make things interesting. It’ll take many loops before you have the ability to calm everyone with some small talk or form alliances with other characters. Eventually, more roles are introduced, including a second alien type bent on destroying the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoRO22"&gt;The loop mechanic can get tedious, but it’s also integral to the story the game is trying to tell. Every time you start over, you learn just a little bit more about the characters, the gnosia, and the mystery of the loop itself. At a certain point I stopped even trying to “win” during the votes and instead experimented with new techniques in hopes of uncovering more clues. There’s even some RPG-like progression, as you can improve your skills across loops; I focused primarily on stealth and charisma, so that people wouldn’t notice me much but would always listen to me when they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5No4v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gnosia&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t quite replicate the experience of playing with real people, but it’s not really trying to. Instead, the game uses the framework of social titles like &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; as a frame for its sci-fi horror story. After about 20 loops, I was hooked and pushing forward through the same routine like a detective in search of any clue I could find. And if I fail? Well, there are plenty of more chances to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjeZI1"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Gnosia &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A YouTuber has already posted a full Galaxy A52 5G unboxing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SefcI2MdrvWvu0FJjNfLlRMxlOs=/267x0:1842x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944216/galaxya52_unboxing_leak.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;New A-series phones, including the A52 5G seen here, are expected to debut on March 17th. | Image: Moboaesthetics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1uGRyb"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G will likely be announced next week at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322232/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-unpacked-event-awesome"&gt;Samsung’s second Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; of the year, but thanks to an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gKPSqrWtAKc"&gt;early unboxing&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a52_5g_appears_in_unboxing_video-news-48142.php"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we won’t have to wait that long to see it in action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcfms9"&gt;The upcoming midrange device has been subject to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;plenty of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309330/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-security-updates-leak"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks, and the video from YouTuber &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1fruDeJL4QcVgFUULX_cQ"&gt;Moboaesthetics&lt;/a&gt; seems to confirm many of them. The device in the video matches up with previously leaked renders and appears to be fully functional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbnzcg"&gt;Specs featured in the lengthy video include a 64-megapixel main camera with OIS, a 120Hz display, IP67 dust and water resistance, under-screen fingerprint sensor, and a 4,500mAh battery. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230868/samsung-galaxy-s21-storage-microsd-support-slot"&gt;Unlike the S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a microSD card slot for memory expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQsP3w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKPSqrWtAKc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tolgqU"&gt;The A52 5G and also-rumored A72 5G are both expected to be accompanied by cheaper non-5G variants with other slightly downgraded specs, like a 90Hz screen rather than 120Hz. All told, they’re shaping up to look like highly competitive midrange phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAegLA"&gt;Samsung has not confirmed exactly what it’s announcing at next week’s event, but given the appearance of this video and the recent leaks, it seems certain that the A52 5G will be making its debut soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valorant pro Sinatraa suspended following sexual assault allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sinatraa" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bx_xPbUJJpXSxw6varJaBfUkAD8=/58x0:901x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68944072/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Robert Paul / Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I5E1RK"&gt;Jay “Sinatraa” Won, one of the biggest names in competitive &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, has been suspended from the game and by his team following accusations of sexual assault. In a statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cIe0h/status/1369497186740928512"&gt;posted on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Cleo Hernandez posted a lengthy account of her nine-month-long relationship with Won, detailing a disturbing history of physical and emotional abuse, supported by audio recordings and screenshots of messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5dxGJ"&gt;“I have avoided talking about any aspects of me and Jay’s relationship for over a year,” Hernandez wrote. “I never spoke about it mostly because this is horrifying, and also because I’ve seen the way women in our community are treated when they try to talk about being hurt by prominent figures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XOTM5o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Gaming can’t fix its abuse problem one person at a time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21307560/gaming-abuse-harassment-systemic-ubisoft-chris-avellone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVPK4m"&gt;Won is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950550/sinatraa-interview-overwatch-league-mvp-san-francisco-shock-e-sports"&gt;a former &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League MVP&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240497/overwatch-league-sinatraa-leaving-sf-shock-valorant"&gt;made the switch to &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. Since Hernandez’s accusations, developer Riot has suspended Won from the game, stating that he won’t be participating in the &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Champions Tour competition that’s slated to take place this weekend. “We are aware of the current situation regarding Jay Won and have launched an investigation,” Alex Francois, Riot’s global head of competitive operations, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/valesports_na/status/1369711283197472769"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIVB4j"&gt;Simiarly, Won’s team, Sentinels, has launched its own investigation and suspended the player. “While the investigation is pending, he is suspended from the team,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sentinels/status/1369717636553183238"&gt;Sentinels said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We will provide a further update once the investigation has concluded.” Won’s former &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League team, the San Francisco Shock, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SFShock/status/1369761148929593350"&gt;similarly issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that “While Jay is no longer a member of the San Francisco Shock, we think it is important to re-emphasize our position of zero tolerance in situations like these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZEJ4N"&gt;Won has yet to release a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szOR1F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 10th, 4:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from the San Francisco Shock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
