    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEuIxV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was March 2020,&lt;/strong&gt; and restaurants across the country were shutting down, setting up takeout windows, or doing whatever they could to absorb the shock of COVID. But it was Chuck E. Cheese, of all places, that had the foresight and steely clarity to see not just what the new era required, but what it permitted. With much of America suddenly interacting with restaurants through delivery apps, the food industry had been transformed into e-commerce, and the arcade better known for its ball pits than its food was free to invent a new identity: “Pasqually’s Pizza &amp;amp; Wings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jT8y4R"&gt;Pasqually’s cover was blown a month later, when Kendall Neff of Philadelphia wrote on Reddit that the pizza she ordered from what she believed was a local mom and pop in fact came from Chuck E. Cheese operating under an alias. But the gambit was a success. This March, the company told the trade publication &lt;a href="https://foodondemandnews.com/03252021/pasquallys-pizza-wont-fade-away-with-the-pandemic/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food on Demand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Pasqually’s is here to stay. And it is far from alone. In fact, during a period when &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/over-110-000-restaurants-have-closed-with-sector-in-free-fall"&gt;restaurants closed&lt;/a&gt; en masse, restaurant &lt;em&gt;brands&lt;/em&gt; proliferated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbP43X"&gt;Big chains like &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/dennys-launches-2-virtual-brands/593173/"&gt;Denny’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/red-robin-diversifies-with-3-delivery-only-brands/596446/"&gt;Red Robin&lt;/a&gt; spawned brands like The Burger Den and The Wing Dept., both announced earlier this year. Meanwhile, a new group of companies is aggressively courting restaurant owners and enlisting them to run delivery-only brands out of their existing businesses. Restaurants can choose from a menu of brands with names like Hot Dog Station, Salad Box, Mr. Cheeseburger, or Grilled Cheese Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ivJMMQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now in my little, 1,000-square-foot restaurant, I’m now carrying about 12, 14 brands”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="UNBgoB"&gt;These are called virtual brands, and as with so many pandemic trends, they preceded COVID but were accelerated by it. In the past, restaurants might occasionally use aliases to increase their likelihood of appearing in search results, and Uber Eats has had a program helping restaurants set them up since 2017. But when it came to imagining the future of delivery, most attention and funding focused on the virtual brand’s better-known cousin, the ghost kitchen. Startups like Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens garnered &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-back-travis-kalanicks-new-startup-11573122604"&gt;large investments&lt;/a&gt; on the premise that multiple delivery-only restaurants sharing specialized commissary spaces would be efficient enough to thrive in the low-margin world of food delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="radKle"&gt;Virtual brands in some ways represented an opposite bet: that there are already too many restaurants, with too much kitchen capacity sitting idle, and that it can be put to use running delivery-only brands. Then came COVID, and every restaurant abruptly had extra kitchen capacity and a desperate need for revenue. There followed a Cambrian explosion of virtual brands. Uber Eats estimates the number of virtual brands on its platform more than tripled in 2020, to over 10,000. Grubhub reports a similar boom. According to a report the company released this year, 15 percent of restaurants operated a virtual brand before the pandemic. By the end of 2020, 51 percent had at least one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkId6B"&gt;And many have more than one brand. A lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdEz2W"&gt;“Now in my little, 1,000-square-foot restaurant, I’m now carrying about 12, 14 brands,” says Ty Brown, with some astonishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZF2oEd"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
  &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KY6iwN"&gt;It started gradually. Brown, a 43-year-old entrepreneur living in Brooklyn, had just opened The Bergen, a small takeout spot in his neighborhood, when he got a call from someone in California who said he was with a company called Future Foods. (Future Foods is actually an arm of Kalanick’s notoriously secretive ghost kitchen company, as food journalist &lt;a href="https://medium.com/hngry/accidental-ghost-kitchens-pervade-as-restaurants-struggle-to-reopen-1bc46bd46c8c"&gt;Matt Newberg reported&lt;/a&gt; in June, though the two do not publicize their connection.) The pitch was simple: Brown was already making burgers and wings at The Bergen, so Future Foods would set him up with some additional brands — Burger Mansion and Killer Wings — which the company would list on delivery apps. Whenever someone bought from one of these brands, Brown would fill the orders, and Future Foods would send him a check for the revenue, minus its cut of around 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvObqi"&gt;The Bergen was Brown’s first restaurant, though far from his first business. He’d long been active in his neighborhood through a variety of ventures, chiefly the Brooklyn United Music &amp;amp; Arts Program, a nonprofit youth center and marching band he founded and runs. The kids in the program were always asking their parents about dinner, he says, so when he noticed the restaurant down the street had closed, he decided to lease it and open a spot of his own. Future Foods seemed like a helpful boost as he got on his feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq7o7B"&gt;He also hoped it would give him an edge on the apps that dominate delivery. Like many restaurant owners, his relationship with the apps is one of fraught dependence. He relies on them for orders and to handle delivery, but their fees, plus the advertising he says he must buy in order to get noticed, means he ends up paying them up to 25 percent of his revenue. “It’s pay to play,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bag with a sticker for a fake brand called Wings of Fire next to a basket of chicken wings and a clear plastic cup with another sticker for Wings of Fire on a yellow backdrop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A3FxkYmsTKfgPZ-oG9LZw1GzmBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544346/akrales_20210524_4543_0224_sq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo illustration / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="TKlbu3"&gt;In their pitches to restaurant owners, virtual brand companies offer to change this dynamic. Some claim to be able to get better rates with the app companies because they negotiate representing hundreds of restaurants rather than just one. They handle advertising and buy it at scale. Often, sales reps hint at arcane knowledge of platform algorithms. (One restaurant owner had been advised to open on a certain day and keep certain hours to win the algorithm’s favor.) But at the simplest level, they supply the menus, photos, and brand names: Something Fishy Fish and Chips, Hey Burger, Tendies Chicken Tenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eWSso"&gt;“With the virtual brands thus far, a lot of it really boils down to search optimization,” says Melissa Wilson, a principal at the food service consulting company Technomic. Just as the incentives and constraints of Google search or Facebook’s News Feed gave rise to certain emergent styles — the keyword-crammed headline, the clickbait tease — digital brands are converging on a distinctive form. Because people search for food on delivery apps in much the same way they search for anything else online — by product type rather than brand — specific restaurant names like The Bergen, named after the street it’s on, or even Denny’s and Red Robin, are too opaque. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzaZmp"&gt;(In retrospect, even Chuck E. Cheese’s Pasqually’s feels like a transitional stage on the way to a fully optimized future, one that hasn’t lost its vestigial human name. Insisting it never meant to deceive, &lt;a href="https://foodondemandnews.com/03252021/pasquallys-pizza-wont-fade-away-with-the-pandemic/"&gt;the company&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out that Pasqually is actually the name of the chef who took in Chuck — or rather, Charles Entertainment Cheese — the orphaned mouse who, according to the character’s surprisingly developed and unexpectedly tragic &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/chuck-e-cheese-backstory-origin-2017-6"&gt;backstory&lt;/a&gt;, throws birthday parties for children to make up for those he never had. “If you’re a brand fan of Chuck E. Cheese, you know who Pasqually is,” an executive assured the trade publication &lt;a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/fast-food/chuck-e-cheese-serious-about-pasquallys-pizza-wings?utm_campaign=20200713&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=jolt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;QSR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re curious to know what Pasqually’s might taste like.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xM9liX"&gt;The newer virtual brands are, paradoxically, distinctively generic. They share an uncanny familiarity, like the name of a restaurant in an airport food court — something that you feel like you’ve heard of before but can’t quite place: Noodle House, Pasta Mania, Chef Burger. It doesn’t take long to develop an ear for them. Technomic’s Wilson picked out two near her: Craftsman Bowls and Craftsman Burgers, spinoffs of a local steakhouse. I first contacted Brown after scanning Grubhub and spotting Wing Dynasty, a name that is both suspiciously bland and contains the truest tell of all: wings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of a basket full of wings over a red and yellow background.

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="YqILHX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Oh my god, &lt;/strong&gt;I’m so sick of talking about chicken wings!” exclaims &lt;em&gt;Food on Demand&lt;/em&gt;’s editor Tom Kaiser, laughing in a way that makes clear he is actually not. “How many wings are people eating in a given week? It’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCudiX"&gt;If virtual brands are the response of an industry transformed abruptly into e-commerce, wings are the iPhone charger, the weighted blanket, the product that is profitable, in-demand, and so close to being a pure commodity that just about everyone is trying for a piece of the action. Just as hundreds of brands with arbitrary names like ASLTW and GOSICUKA will pop up on &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-copyright.html"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to sell identical cables or hair ties made in the same factory, because no one brand dominates and anyone has a shot at winning the algorithmic lottery, wing brands exploded over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRvTgH"&gt;Rishi Nigam, CEO of Franklin Junction, calls it “the great chicken wing rush of 2020.” His company mostly matches established brands with restaurants that have excess capacity — in practice, often chains inside chains, like the Canadian seafood company The Captain’s Boil, which ran for a time out of &lt;a href="https://www.myrecordjournal.com/News/Meriden/Meriden-News/Ruby-Tuesday-now-a-host-kitchen-for-Captain-s-Boil.html"&gt;Ruby Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; — but it made an exception for wings, launching Wings of New York, a virtual brand from the hotdog company Nathan’s Famous, as well as WingDepo, which runs out of Frisch’s Big Boy. (With virtual brands, it all gets very complicated very quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WTC7AT"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
  &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CeeuTt"&gt;From April 2020 through February 2021, a period when restaurant visits and orders dropped by about 11 percent, wing sales actually rose by 10 percent, according to David Portalatin, senior vice president food industry advisor at NPD. “American restaurants in the United States have served more than a billion servings of wings since the pandemic came along,” Portalatin says. The same period saw wing prices surge far beyond their pre-pandemic level. According to USDA data, wing prices in the Northeast were up nearly 50 percent at the end of February 2021 from where they were the year before, and they have continued to climb. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/operations/massive-chicken-wing-shortage-brewing"&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; of wing shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KclkB4"&gt;Wings, like pizza and unlike, say, tacos, handle delivery well, and some of the restaurants that specialize in wings, like Wingstop, were already adept at digital ordering and particularly well-suited for the pandemic, Kaiser says. Wings are also extremely simple to make. “It’s a one-ingredient menu, right?” says Nigam. “There’s no barrier to entry. You and I could launch a wing brand by 6PM tonight.” Crucially, no one brand dominated the category, and there is no proprietary wing type or sauce, so any given restaurant’s overnight wing brand had a decent chance of winning attention on the delivery apps. This made wings an obvious first target for restaurants that had idle kitchens and needed additional revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaTL4I"&gt;“It all added up to a perfect storm,” says Portalatin, “for wings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="85PF77"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I had to go open up a credit account in order to just carry enough wings. I had to go buy more freezers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="DXB7JI"&gt;Spencer Rubin, founder and CEO of the New York sandwich chain Melt Shop, had been thinking about testing a wing brand before the pandemic, maybe for football season. Then COVID hit and his walk-in business evaporated. People were ordering dinner more than lunch, Rubin observed, and were particularly interested in “craveable” comfort foods, and there were only a few good wing brands in New York City, so he launched Wing Shop. “We got lucky with that one,” he says, being among the early entrants to the great wings rush. Now “everyone and their mother is launching a wing concept.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxBHCX"&gt;Big chains like Applebee’s jumped in, first with the brand Neighborhood Wings, then with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/applebee-s-owner-says-it-found-formula-to-stand-out-on-ubereats"&gt;Cosmic Wings&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to establish a proprietary moat through exclusive Cheetos dust. &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/help-virtual-brand-chilis-sees-near-normal-sales-january"&gt;Chili’s&lt;/a&gt; launched It’s just Wings. The &lt;a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/emerging-concepts/smokey-bones-virtual-wing-brand-races"&gt;Smokey Bones&lt;/a&gt; barbecue chain launched The Wing Experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wexmgA"&gt;Meanwhile, virtual franchises started hitting up independent operators and pushing them to take on additional wing brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5p6Co"&gt;“It was crazy with wings,” says Dawn Skeete, the owner of Jam’it Bistro. She opened her Jamaican restaurant in south Brooklyn in 2019, and when the pandemic hit, Future Foods seemed like an appealing way to test what items at what prices sold in her neighborhood. The barbecue brand, OMG BBQ LOL, didn’t work out, but she kept going with Just Wing It. Then she took on a second wing brand, Wing Spot, after a new virtual franchise company called Acelerate.io approached her.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A bag with a sticker for a fake brand called Devilish Wings next to a basket of chicken wings and a clear plastic cup with another sticker for Devilish Wings on an orange backdrop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/79ss7yxzHcDjEO0MtW4A2t_5RL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544344/akrales_20210524_4543_0170_drips_sq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo illustration / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="gqrOJ0"&gt;Acelerate.io is an LA-based company founded by a former DoorDash employee named George Jacobs, who felt that for delivery to be profitable, kitchens had to increase “throughput” by operating multiple restaurants. The company launched in late 2019 — with a wing brand, naturally — and now runs seven brands in “several hundred” restaurants across the US. (It’s spelled “Acelerate” because it’s “more efficient with just one c,” Jacobs says, but also because “accelerate.com” was too expensive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1li7t9"&gt;Just Wing It and Wing Spot have the same menu, Skeete says, which helped with bulk purchases as wings got more expensive. “Wing prices are going through the roof, and I think it has to do with all these virtual kitchens that are doing wings,” she says. She’s now looking to take on a third wing brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjQqaf"&gt;Brown always made wings at The Bergen, both under his own name and Future Foods’ Killer Wings. Business was good for much of 2020. The Bergen’s takeout and delivery-focused business was well-positioned for the spring lockdowns. It got publicity for &lt;a href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/brooklyn/brooklyn-restaurant-the-bergen-offering-free-meals-amid-covid-19-crisis/"&gt;donating meals&lt;/a&gt; to families in need, followed by more attention as a local Black-owned establishment during the protests surrounding George Floyd’s murder. The pace was almost more than staff could handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLuLlG"&gt;But by the end of the year, business was flagging, so in January, Brown responded to a pitch from Nextbite, an arm of the restaurant software company &lt;a href="https://foodondemandnews.com/11112020/alex-canter-talks-ordermark-and-nextbites-120m-war-chest/"&gt;Ordermark&lt;/a&gt;. The company recently received a $120 million investment from SoftBank and has been expanding aggressively, offering restaurant owners, which it calls “fulfillment partners,” a selection of “turnkey” virtual brands from which to choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w7UgTl"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
  &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kWxY7c"&gt;“Nextbite, man, the day I opened up that brand, they put out a lot of wings,” says Brown. “I had to go shop for more wings. I had to go open up a credit account in order to just carry enough wings. I had to go buy more freezers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KNJgI"&gt;The new brands were doing better on the apps than The Bergen, a fact Brown attributes to their ability to game their algorithms. “I call it the wizard behind the curtain,” he says. If a brand’s sales are low, he’ll call his support person at its parent company and ask them what’s going on. “Can the wizard click the magic button?” he jokes. “They start laughing at me, but they tell me that they know the algorithm, they know how to make sure we’re first on these websites.” A few days later, the orders flood in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5gAS5"&gt;It worked so well he signed up for another company, The Local Culinary, a Miami-based business that started as a ghost kitchen but pivoted to the virtual &lt;a href="https://foodondemandnews.com/09032020/the-local-culinary-launches-as-first-ghost-kitchen-franchise/"&gt;franchise model&lt;/a&gt; last year. Next came Virtual Dining Concepts, that one run by Robert Earl, the former CEO of Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood. Earl launched Virtual Dining Concepts in 2019 after becoming disillusioned with the economics of ghost kitchens. It started, as all things do, with a wing brand, Wing Squad, being run out of Buca di Beppos and other restaurants he owns. But during the pandemic, he began licensing brands to other restaurants as well as coupling them with celebrities, an attempt to bring the power of fame and virality to the search-dominated delivery sector. Recent innovations include Tyga Bites and MrBeast Burger, which Earl says will be operating out of over 1,000 kitchens by the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urAMul"&gt;Brown found it to be a polished operation: video modules to train staff on how to prepare the food and a requirement that they send in a photo of it packaged with branded stickers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hJ8Po"&gt;Soon, he was selling burgers under the names of Chef Burger, Burger Mansion, Hey Burger, and MrBeast Burger. Wings were sold under the names CHICKS, Wild Wild Wings, Crispy Wings, Killer Wings, Firebelly Wings, and The Wing Dynasty. It is a mathematically daunting array of burgers and wings, and that is to say nothing of newer additions like Hot Dog Station and Hot Potato. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6b6Ab7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et1R71"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6rhJm5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In theory, people are free to try weird things; in practice, most everyone makes wings.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="whLlXE"&gt;Yelp reviews for The Bergen show complaints over late and mixed-up orders, including several in which orders are confused for other brands. “So I ordered from a restaurant called Hook, Line and Seafood, and some time later I received a call from The Bergen,” reads one of several one-star reviews. “Evidently they’re at the same address.” Brown has begun offering raises to employees who can memorize all the menus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlR4oK"&gt;Yet, from another perspective, it is all very simple: burgers, chicken sandwiches, wings. “They’re branded differently but they’re made the same,” Brown says. “A cheeseburger with egg and bacon is called a Morning Glory. Somebody else calls it a breakfast sandwich. Somebody else calls it the Egg-o-nomitor — I don’t know, I’m making it up, but it’s the same exact thing, it just depends on who’s calling it what.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEcAU3"&gt;“Instead of saying buffalo wings, they might say classic wings,” he goes on. “It’s the same exact wing, man. One might have one sauce different. My wings, their wings, the other wings — they’re all the same wings. I even stopped making my wings the way I used to make them. I’m a Black guy. We used to season our wings. I stopped because nobody else is doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvpbyK"&gt;Other elements of The Bergen’s menu have begun to resemble its corporate guests. If a brand has a burger that’s selling well, Brown will add it to his own menu — he’s already buying the same ingredients, after all — under yet another name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RAPEp"&gt;Proponents of digital brands and ghost kitchens often pitch them as a way for chefs to experiment. When you don’t have to lease new space or hire new staff, it becomes less costly to try something new. At the same time, the availability of data about what works, platforms that algorithmically reward success with more success, and the way people search for generic products all create evolutionary pressure in the same direction. It’s a push-pull we’ve seen play out on other platforms. In theory, people are free to try weird things; in practice, most everyone makes wings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="j7FMLl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other restaurant&lt;/strong&gt; owners are warier of the trend. Robert Guarino, who owns several restaurants in New York and is the CEO of Five Napkin Burger, started a virtual brand last summer (wings, of course) but is winding it down now. He warns that grafting delivery brands onto an existing restaurant can be harder than the pitches make it out to be. Capitalizing on excess kitchen capacity seems simple until owners realize everyone is ordering from all their menus between 6 and 8PM, or that multiple items need the same equipment, or that staff can’t keep up. “Restaurants are in some ways little factories; in some ways, they’re not,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JuC9C"&gt;His other concern is longer term, and one shared by many in the industry: that the delivery apps themselves will launch virtual brands. They have the data on what foods perform well, and they control what restaurants rank highly in search; what’s to stop them from launching a virtual brand themselves, asks Guarino, or offering brands to restaurants willing to pay them higher fees? “That’s the moment that the independent restaurant community has always been afraid of,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ACkO1"&gt;Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, compares it to Amazon’s practice of using data gleaned from its Marketplace to identify successful products and sell its own version. “It’s kind of the next logical step,” says Rigie. “It’s like Amazon Basics, where they say, ‘Okay, we’ll continue to sell your burgers, but now we’ve learned how to make our own burgers, and if you want your burgers to be listed above our burgers, you’re going to have to pay an additional premium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWyEyo"&gt;It’s not an unreasonable fear. None of the delivery apps have managed to make the business consistently profitable, and while margins in the restaurant industry are thin, it represents at least a possible path to financial viability. The apps are also facing the threat of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-nyc-restaurants-tire-of-forking-over-delivery-app-fees-11618059602?mod=e2tw"&gt;defections&lt;/a&gt; over their high fees, as some restaurants start handling orders and delivery themselves. Running virtual restaurants would be one way to maintain a baseline selection on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="4oL3MC"&gt;The apps and the franchises are already working closely together. In December, Grubhub launched a program called &lt;a href="https://get.grubhub.com/blog/intro-branded-virtual-restaurants"&gt;Branded Virtual Restaurants&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership with Virtual Dining Concepts and the Chicago restaurant group Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, and began running Facebook ads and sending emails courting owners. “These are simple, low-risk solutions for adding a new revenue stream to your business without increasing your overhead costs,” reads one Grubhub email inviting restaurant owners to sign up for brands like Pauly D’s Italian Subs or Mario’s Tortas Lopez. “Each Branded Virtual Restaurant is backed by a celebrity and national marketing campaign that’s sure to attract new customers to your restaurant.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74rPK"&gt;Brown received the pitch and is enthusiastic about the partnership for the same reason other restaurant owners are wary: he believes Grubhub’s involvement will give him an advantage. Searching for ways to open more brands, he recently expanded into a second Brooklyn location and is setting up outposts in Orlando and Atlanta. He hopes to open each with 15 to 20 brands. He feels the virtual restaurant boom is just beginning. He’s getting more and more ads and inquiries inviting him to sign up with brand after brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXEwZ5"&gt;Recently, he learned about yet another company joining the rush. Google is testing a partnership with Nextbite and will be placing orders using its delivery service from Brown’s shop, among others. (Nextbite said it had no information to share at this time. Google did not respond to a request for comment.) It’s an ominous sign for the delivery apps which, after inserting themselves between customers and restaurants, now face the prospect of a yet bigger company doing the same to them. But for Brown, it’s a vote of confidence from one of the largest companies in the world that the future he’s betting on is the right one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNOYwf"&gt;It’s a strange future, one where restaurants find a way to thrive in the low-margin world of delivery by becoming something else, something more like a food factory optimized for maximum output, with its production lines determined by an assortment of technology platforms and branding companies. It’s a more opaque world than the industry seemed to be headed toward a few years ago, when restaurants were advertising locally sourced ingredients and gesturing toward transparency in their supply chains. Instead, it will have some of the mystery of e-commerce, where a single click summons an item — from where exactly is unclear, and less important than the speed with which it arrives. In exchange for the specificity of physical restaurants, consumers will have an abundance of ever-changing choices, though perhaps all made in the same kitchen, and will find whatever it is they search for, especially if it’s wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrWDd5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro are $50 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmXGmS7SnDxJ7dM83hfUgP1pVJg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370897/bfarsace_210114_4372_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kg4sQS"&gt;If you’re hunting for a set of truly wireless earbuds that offer great sound quality, active noise cancellation, IPX7 water resistance, a comfy fit, and other handy features, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro are at an especially good price today on Amazon. Normally $200, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWWNGYG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the silver and violet colorways are $150&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen to date on a new set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jBpCW"&gt;These work best on Samsung phones, and you’ll lose out on their automatic device switching feature and the 3D audio feature on other Android phones. Same goes for iOS, but they’re even more limited on that platform. The Galaxy Buds iOS app mentions that the Buds Pro aren’t supported, but my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Chris Welch wrote in his review&lt;/a&gt; that this means iPhone users can’t use the Buds Pro’s voice detect feature that automatically turns the music down when you’re talking. Otherwise, you’ll still be able to pair and use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MTDl1h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JQmAgF"&gt;Another wireless earbud deal you might care about is on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case-2nd-gen-6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished Apple AirPods at Woot that cost just $95&lt;/a&gt;. These are the second-generation model that include a wired charging case that originally sold for $159. They’re new right now at some retailers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $120&lt;/a&gt;, but head over to Woot if you want to save even more. This model is a “grade A” unit with “minimal cosmetic damage” at most, and with “like-new functionality.”  These are covered with a 90-day warranty through Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IZpMIr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10504234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8axf7a"&gt;One of the best leftover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/28/22453053/best-memorial-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-headphones"&gt;Memorial Day deals&lt;/a&gt; is on the 40mm GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 6. It’s for the model with a red-colored casing and sport band, and its price is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $329 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (originally $399). The bigger 44mm Apple Watch Series 6 in this colorway &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $359 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. No other colors are seeing this big of a price cut right now, so check out this deal if you want Apple’s latest wearable without paying full price, and if you’re in love with red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oyzvlG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8PZC"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;latest generation of Amazon’s Echo Dot smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; with a built-in LED display that tells the time and temperature is $15 off. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag one for $45&lt;/a&gt;. It has seen a discount every few weeks since it launched earlier in 2021, but it hasn’t gone much lower than this yet. We predict that it will likely be more affordable during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which might be on June 21st and 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Spotify’s Horacio Gutierrez thinks Apple behaves like a monopolist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIN3M9KzV2xze_S3AcH5HPyxFaA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370867/VRG_ILLO_Decoder_HoracioGutierrez_s.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Spotify’s chief legal officer on tech’s ‘ruthless bully’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6NDKsS"&gt;This week I’m talking to Horacio Gutierrez, head of global affairs and chief legal officer of Spotify, to help me understand why Spotify and so many other app developers are so frustrated with Apple. Horacio recently testified in front of Congress about Apple’s business practices, and he just wrote &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-monopolist-worm-in-apple-11621290094"&gt;an op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calling Apple a “ruthless bully.” That’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsYnd7"&gt;But it’s all part of a trend. You probably know that there’s a lot of government interest around the world in managing the size and power of big tech companies. A few weeks ago, we had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;Senator Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt; on the show to talk about her proposed antitrust law reforms. There are ongoing antitrust lawsuits from the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and various states against Google, Facebook, and now Amazon. There is a ton of regulatory pressure in Europe, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;a new proceeding against Apple&lt;/a&gt; and a long history of enforcements against Google and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBwngg"&gt;And of course, there is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the trial&lt;/a&gt; between Epic Games — maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite —&lt;/em&gt; and Apple. Epic sued Apple nine months ago, claiming that the iPhone maker unfairly restricts competition for app distribution and in-app payments, and requested sweeping remedies from the judge, including allowing other app stores on Apple devices. That trial took three weeks, involved testimony from both Apple CEO Tim Cook and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, and produced a mountain of internal emails and documents from both companies as evidence. At the heart of it all is one number: 30 percent. That’s the fee Apple charges app developers for in-app purchases of anything digital. So if you buy a physical hardcover book from Amazon for $10, you pay the entire 10 to Amazon. But if you were able to buy a Kindle book in the Kindle app for $10, three dollars would go to Apple. Amazon doesn’t want to give up that money, which is why you can’t buy books in the Kindle app on the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8eIoI"&gt;Epic claimed that this whole situation was anti-competitive, and we had a trial. We’re not expecting a decision from that trial for weeks, if not months. But I wanted to understand what all of this legal maneuvering means, what we’ve learned, and how involving courts and politicians in the workings of our phones would actually make them better. There’s some fuzziness there, right? I don’t think it’s obvious to most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RgvGX"&gt;I really wanted to push on what Horacio sees as the biggest problems with Apple’s behavior, what he would actually do to fix it, and how all of that connects to having more interesting, innovative, and better products in our lives. Because if you can’t make that case, then aren’t we just moving money around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABx7VL"&gt;I also asked Horacio if he sees a connection between how he perceives Apple and how musicians perceive Spotify — after all, they’re both huge companies with which most working creatives don’t get to negotiate. And Spotify has been buying up big chunks of the podcasting ecosystem, giving it a dominant position in a fast-growing industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xsoR5b"&gt;Horacio unsurprisingly pushed back on these comparisons — citing a range of statistics from Spotify’s &lt;a href="https://loudandclear.byspotify.com/"&gt;Loud and Clear website&lt;/a&gt; that lays out exactly how and how much it pays artists around the world. But as all of these companies get bigger, the dynamics that play out between platforms and creators feel eerily similar. Keep that in mind as you read this conversation: what does it even mean to have a market if so many players don’t feel like they can negotiate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jkHf7b"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP8188613259" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TRHB2Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSg1As"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horacio Gutierrez, you’re the chief legal officer of Spotify, welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVu4Z0"&gt;Thank you, Nilay, great to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmRsZX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You just wrote a pretty scathing op-ed in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; called “The Monopolist Worm in Apple,” in which you called Apple a “ruthless bully.” Tell me what you mean by calling Apple a bully?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMbp0p"&gt;Listen, Apple’s a large company, it’s an incredibly successful company and an admirable company in many ways. I’m a fan of Apple’s products, I’ve always been. One of the things that people commented on after they saw my testimony in the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee meeting a couple of months ago is that they couldn’t believe that I was being critical of Apple while visibly wearing an Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z30hxt"&gt;But the reality is that you can admire a company and a lot of what they’ve done and the beautiful products they create and [still] be critical in the way that they behave in certain aspects of their business. It is clear to me that when it comes to their policies on app stores and the way in which they’re treating [not just] competing apps, but a whole variety of apps on their App Store, is just unfair, and I think it deserves regulatory attention and I think they’re getting regulatory attention for it. You can love a company and at the same time be able to point out things that they should be doing differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkDU8X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s regulatory attention in the United States, there’s also a lot of regulatory attention in the EU. I want to talk about that specifically with you and compare and contrast. There’s also legal attention with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but I noticed as I read this piece, you didn’t lay out any specific remedies or changes that you want governments or judges to make. What do you think needs to change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPXkaH"&gt;There are some concrete things that are needed in order to restore the competitive environment, and then there are some sort of longer-range issues and things that have to happen just with respect to online platforms in general, and especially for larger gatekeeper platforms like Apple. Concretely, when it comes to the App Store, it is very clear that the choice to tie Apple’s proprietary payment system to the App Store was an arbitrary choice. It wasn’t part of the App Store in the beginning, just as the 30 percent Apple tax wasn’t a requirement when we made it into the App Store. They bolted that on later in the process and in doing that, they created this environment in which competing apps really have to contend with Apple’s own music streaming service as well as other competing products on what’s not really a level playing field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmODZ2"&gt;So it’s actually quite simple. We want Apple to go back to the situation that existed at the time when we joined the App Store. We want them to undo the tying of their proprietary payment system to the App Store and all of the other anti-steering provisions, which is a fancy way of saying punishments and penalties that they’ve created for those people who do not want to use their proprietary payment system. Basically, restore the situation to the way it was before their anti-competitive abuse started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDdEKk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It feels like one of the hills you have to climb is that people really love Apple, including regulators. You mentioned people calling out the fact that you wore an Apple Watch, you clearly like their products. But regulators, the general public, and people like you and me, think the company makes good products. Tim Cook always calls out their customer satisfaction in excess of 90 percent. Do you have to wage a public relations battle in order to win this sort of policy battle that you’re trying to win?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY1YnH"&gt;I don’t know if I would call it a public relations battle, but I think it is important for people to be told about all the bad acts that companies like ours have experienced on the part of Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uRe4i"&gt;I think the perception is [that] because their products are attractive and popular — and obviously there’s the whole legacy of Steve Jobs and what he meant for Apple and for technology in general — one has to overcome this presumption that everything they do is equally innovative and pro-competitive, when in reality, that wasn’t the case. Every time we had these discussions with regulators and policymakers over the years, even before we filed our complaint in Europe, we did notice that we had to overcome a number of assumptions and a number of myths, so to speak, about Apple’s behavior, and they needed to be educated, not based on our opinion, but based on the actual facts. What did Apple do and when, and what was the justification for the steps that they took?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71qEnF"&gt;They created these obligations after they had lured apps into the App Store. People don’t realize, initially when the iPhone was launched, it was designed to only have Apple’s own apps in it. But at the time [they were in a] dog fight with Android, and they saw that they were not going to be able to keep up with Android unless they opened up the App Store, which they did later on. They had this campaign on TV, “There’s an app for that,” and they were touting how every user could find any app that they wanted on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cAxHRN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0h2U2"&gt;Then they got to a point where they achieved critical mass in terms of applications. And at that point they started to change the rules and they started to tighten the rules, and they started to do that especially with respect to applications on the App Store that were competing with Apple’s own services. So people need to be reminded, a little bit, of history, so that they understand the pattern of behavior and the motivations behind those actions on the part of Apple, which is why we felt we needed to tell our story. We were the first ones that had the courage to be able to come out. It is not easy to make the decision to take on a $2 trillion company with the global footprint and the power over life and death of an app developer that they have, but now we’re not alone. It’s like the dam broke and there’s all kinds of companies that have come out in many sectors of technology and media and other areas, and now it’s clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6b8AV"&gt;It sort of reminds me a little bit of what happened in the Microsoft case, where initially the issues were with Sun Microsystems and a handful of other companies, and then at some point it just became a chorus of companies pointing out, “There is a fundamental problem here with the way this company behaves, and it’s one that needs to be remedied if we’re going to allow the next generation of technology companies to emerge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpUYVz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have filed this complaint with your case in the EU and now we are talking just a couple of days after the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; trial has wrapped up, which laid out a very similar story. What, if anything, from the trial stood out to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QGrzL"&gt;A couple of things. Obviously when we filed our case, we didn’t have the benefit of going through discovery of a number of documents and internal email that really opened the curtains on the way that Apple was thinking about these things. There’s a lot of very interesting internal communications that really reveal the way Apple executives were thinking about the App Store, and the imposition of Apple’s payment system, and their intent to lock in users and things like that. So obviously in that sense, the trial has been very revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HIZiF"&gt;The other thing is, it’s remarkable how little we learned about Apple’s explanation for these things. They continue to go back to the same pretextual explanations for why they do what they do. They continue to say, “Well, we have to protect the privacy and security of our users and that’s why we have to charge 30 percent and have all these other restrictions.” But how can it be indispensable for them to do all those things in order to protect privacy and security when they don’t even apply those rules to a number of other apps that are on the App Store? Even if it was that essential, there’s really a disconnect between the explanations that they’re trying to give and the reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwKQXz"&gt;The other thing that struck me is how disingenuous it is that they would say that nobody’s ever looked at the economics of the App Store, nobody’s even asked the question, “How much money does the App Store make?” You’re talking about tens of billions of dollars of revenue, based on the estimates that are out there. This is not like the budget line for printer toner at Apple, this is a huge sum of revenue. I think it defies credulity for Apple to say they’re not doing this for the money and they haven’t even asked how much money they’re making there. There’s a number of things that have come out that are quite telling about the way that Apple has thought about these things internally, and there is a clear anti-competitive pattern behind their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxyQpj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push you on this a little bit. There were multiple sealed documents in sessions that obviously you and I didn’t get to see. As far as the public discovery, Epic wasn’t able to find anything, any charts or presentations or graphs or financial results, that would prove Apple was actually keeping track of App Store profit and loss. You would think Epic would be laser-focused on trying to find that. And as far as we are aware in the public record, they were not able to. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRWT5A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do take Apple’s point that their exertion of control over the platform is required to keep people safe from the massive number of threats that everyday users of internet services face. For example, if you don’t want to see a massive amount of extended credit card fraud, it is better for Apple to just hold all the credit card information. If you don’t want to see a massive amount of social engineering, it is better for Apple to more tightly control user data. I’m sure Facebook has a lot of thoughts about that. But I guess the question here is, how does that all relate to the 30 percent rate, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9j8cj"&gt;That’s exactly the point that I was trying to make. The connection between the need to charge 30 percent of all revenues generated by apps, that compete with Apple’s for the most part, in perpetuity...how does that in any way connect to the desire to keep users data protected and to keep them secure? If there is a connection, then [why do] they only charge the 30 percent mostly to digital content and gaming applications and not to Walmart or Facebook or Uber or other things like that? It’s a completely arbitrary construct and it is not justified by privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Orfn54"&gt;Apple should have enough of a powerful incentive in the billions of dollars that they generate from selling devices like iPhones and iPads to keep users safe. That’s where the bulk of the revenue comes [from]. Having users’ data be protected and users be secure is one of the selling points of those devices. So the notion that all of a sudden they would stop investing in privacy and security protections if they didn’t have the 30 percent tax that they impose on the App Store is just ridiculous and it really defies credulity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxFxxt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rate, and the lack of negotiation on the rate, feels like the issue. If I could wave a magic wand and set that rate at 15 percent, would you be happy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtfONR"&gt;Let me take issue with your premise. The issue is not whether the rate is 30 or 15 or 10 percent, the issue is that the rate is arbitrary and they get to set it unilaterally because they’ve insulated themselves from competition. What should happen is Apple should be able to charge 30, or 50 percent, if they can convince users in a market economy that the value that they provide justifies the 30 percent, or the 15 percent, or the 50 percent. What we’re saying is they actually prevent competitors from coming in and offering alternative payment systems, and therefore there is no market. There is a monopoly on payment systems, which is why they can afford to impose the 30 percent. Let the market decide. Enable PayPal and Mastercard and other new payment systems to come in and then let users decide, vote with their dollars on whether Apple’s technology is so superior when it comes to payment and all these other things that they’re willing to pay 30 percent more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqyd2v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is really complicated because the market for a payment processing service is not consumers, it’s app developers. And the market for privacy and security is consumers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rh5Eud"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you connect those two markets such that you’re saying to regular people, “We’re investing all of this stuff in keeping you safe.” Which is Apple’s argument. And you’re saying to Spotify and Epic and whoever else, “Hey, our technology solution is better such that it’s worth more money than PayPal.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDNZSt"&gt;If app developers have the choice of offering more than one payment system, they will decide which one is better for their products and then users ultimately would decide whether they want to use those services or not. So the decision on which payment systems to incorporate would be left to the apps and the users then will decide which apps they trust. That’s the way it has always worked, that’s the way it works on most other platforms outside of the mobile operating system device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fkG79"&gt;That is actually the way that it should work so that there is real competition, but developers don’t have that choice. Developers can’t even [create] a system in which you said, “You have to offer Apple payment systems as a choice, but you can tell users there are others, and by the way, there is a price difference. You can go with the Apple in-app purchasing system, and your product will be 30 percent more expensive. Or you could use this one that has PayPal as the service technology provider and it’ll be 30 percent cheaper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMWMxr"&gt;Let users decide. Why can’t users make that choice based on the information that is transparently provided to them? That’s the concern. The market is not operating. And people assume it has always been like that. “You kind of knew what the rules were when you came in.” And that’s when I stop them and I say, “Well, no. That is not historically correct. It wasn’t always like that. It wasn’t like that when we joined the App Store.” Those rules were bolted onto the system later on by Apple, once they knew they had a position where people had no choice but to accept the terms that Apple would impose unilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGcs97"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think about other disputes in related industries. The one that comes to my mind most often is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310442/tv-streaming-youtube-fubo-price-increases-carrier-fees-disputes-costs-cable-television"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a carriage dispute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; between a cable channel and a cable operator. We see this all the time. Some set of channels are going to leave DirecTV, and then both sides do a bunch of marketing, and eventually both sides cut a deal and the cable channels come back. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nKmd2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic kind of used that model, didn’t they? They pushed a hotfix [to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;], Apple kicked them off the store, and they launched their marketing campaign. Now they’re in a lawsuit against Apple, and on and on it goes. Have you ever thought about saying, “Hey, look, in 90 days we’re going to leave. We’re taking Spotify off iOS devices unless Apple comes to the table. Every Spotify user, make your voice heard so we can gain the leverage to negotiate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcnVtL"&gt;There is no reason why a platform provider that’s supposed to be a neutral platform provider like Apple would be allowed to create conditions that would force companies like ours to have to make that choice. They say, “Well, but we built it.” Yeah, you built it. But when you built it it wasn’t like that. It was significantly built on the backs of the work of many app developers that came to the App Store that you touted as the reason why people should come and use your platform. And whether you built it or not, it really doesn’t matter from an antitrust perspective. The railroad companies built the railroads, the steel companies built the steel mills, and the telephone companies built the telephone lines. … The biggest cases in the history of antitrust enforcement in the US had to do with companies that had built that infrastructure and then used the power that that control gave them to hurt competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hT0lOJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going to push you, because I hear from our listeners and our readers all the time that they love the way that Apple products work. They are paying the premium for Apple’s products because they expect Apple’s executives to make choices about how the products will work and where the limits are. They do not want regulators and lawsuits to change it. I understand it — I think in a way it is an expression of consumer preference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dzkEK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re wearing an Apple Watch. I think it’s really notable that everyone called that out; it’s a good product. What is the mechanism by which all of this regulatory and legal pressure actually makes the products better? I think that’s the hump you have to get over with regular consumers. Instead of just moving money around between a bunch of huge companies, showing them that at the end of the day they are going to get better products out of more competition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRH645"&gt;Yeah, I know that’s sometimes hard for consumers to envision. They’re not in this world and they are judging the reality by the products that they have in front of them. But the reality is that fair competition and open competition is really a prerequisite for more innovation, for new products that will exist a year down the road that don’t exist today. It’s super hard to say what they are. That’s why it’s called innovation. Somebody has to invent these things and develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCf7oS"&gt;The problem, fundamentally, and the way I explain it to my relatives, and to my friends, and to my high school classmates, is to say that consumers also enjoy the fact that they have choice. The fact that there is a thriving competitive environment between different music streaming services that are trying to do new things, that you’re allowing a company like a Clubhouse or another company to come up with new audio streaming scenarios that weren’t there before. Everyone benefits when there’s an environment where companies have an incentive to try to think of things that haven’t been thought through before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="U0mBlG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Consumers know what happens when there’s no competition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BichtA"&gt;The problem we have right now is … you have the world of mobile devices — which have become the primary way in which people access the internet and commerce and all those things — that are controlled essentially by two companies. Two companies that are not only the platform but also competitors downstream in some areas. Consumers know what happens when there is no competition and when there is only one company left. We’ve experienced that in broadband services, we’ve experienced that in a number of other areas in our lives, and in our lifetime. We know that what happens is at that point the incentive to innovate, the incentive to continue to improve your products goes away, prices rise, and that hurts consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1o7UJh"&gt;There is evidence in history of what happened there. When Apple was the only game in town with iTunes and [music] downloads before music streaming rose because of the things we did and then other companies did later, it wasn’t great. It wasn’t great for music labels, it wasn’t great for a number of other companies because you are negotiating with one single player who has all the cards and who has all the control. Competition is good, competition ensures that there is a pipeline of exciting innovative products, it keeps companies on their toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1IV5w"&gt;When a company with this amount of power decides that they’re going to forbid competition in areas where they really didn’t have a position [in] before, they’re doing it because they have the power to do it. It is not the market economy system that we want to have in this country and that other countries want to have, and it is not right. At the end of the day, consumers benefit when, without all these hurdles, and friction, and artificial things, they can enjoy all the perks of the latest and greatest innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTUocx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That was a lot of very high-minded, idealistic conversation about competition and where it comes from and where innovation comes from. But as you said, Apple makes most of the App Store revenue with in-app purchases and games. So if Apple came to you, Spotify’s head lawyer, and said, “Okay. We’re going to open up third-party processing for music streaming services. But we’re going to keep it locked down for games.” Would you take that deal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8xvUd"&gt;Would I hold out the solution to the problem in wanting to stream until the problem for all industries were solved? It’s a hypothetical, but I would tell you, I [would] take the win. But it doesn’t mean the discussion is over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxStyv"&gt;The reality is, you look at each and every one of these cases independently, the Epic litigation, the Spotify case, all of these things. I’m actually convinced that whether any one of those cases is won or lost is less important than the fact that now this is a topic that’s in the forefront of the minds of policymakers and regulators around the world. I actually think that what has started is irreversible, and there is no outcome in the Epic case or in our case that is going to change the direction of this. If we win, that will solve some aspects of this and then there’ll be other cases that will solve other aspects of this for some other industries. If we lose, it will just strengthen the cause for legislative reform, because if we lose it is because the current antitrust legal system hasn’t kept up to speed with the internet economy and the power that these gatekeeper companies can have on a global perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEGMiV"&gt;One way or the other, there are going to be changes. There is a realization in the US that is remarkably bipartisan, that these online platform companies are just too powerful, that self regulation has not worked, and is not going to work because the economic incentives of these platform companies are just too strong, and that the government needs to step in and needs to take steps to restore competition. As has happened in the history of the US and in Europe, over the last century, there have been major cases that have reset how we understand the competitive landscape from a legal perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FymQeb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your prediction of what the judge will rule in the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; trial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjDSIF"&gt;Any lawyer that has any self-respect will decline politely any invitation to make a prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41NiuB"&gt;These are difficult cases. What I’m telling you is whatever happens at the trial level is not going to be the end of the Epic case. And whatever happens in the Epic case is not going to be the end of the Spotify case in Europe, or so many other cases, or regulatory investigations that are happening across Europe and in Asia, and in other parts of the world. This is not the end, there is no individual case where all the marbles are at stake. This is the beginning of a process to change our understanding on how policy and regulation should work with respect to these super powerful platform companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts7tW7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the US and the EU. We are living through what a handful of very smart people have told me is like a natural A/B test in regulatory policy. The United States has a very deregulatory approach. Our antitrust policy is based on something called consumer welfare, which is very focused on pricing effects. That means we’ve done virtually no regulation at all. The EU has antitrust policy based on ensuring competition, which means social regulators are very active in ensuring competition. They do a lot of things all of the time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QndN2d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see those two approaches playing out right now? And do you worry that one of the promises of the internet is this immediate global market access? Do you worry that, as those approaches splinter, the power of the internet market is going to shrink over time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6gbLQ"&gt;When I think of antitrust policy in the US, I really think you have to take a broad lens and look at the long history of antitrust enforcement. People say, “Well, we have a more Darwinian mindset when it comes to competition and so it is more or less a fair thing.” But the reality is antitrust law was created in this country. Sometimes the US has been at the forefront of that. There is a kind of a pendulum swing that goes through the appetite of governments to take certain cases on. The Microsoft case was the last one that went through the appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgXR1q"&gt;But now you see the DOJ, even during the last administration, file cases against other technology companies. The EU likewise has tried a number of things, and it’s developed their own set of cases, and their own line of things. But in many respects, while you could say the sources of the legal philosophy and the legal history of the two systems have been slightly different, they’re more similar than they’re different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJHCUD"&gt;I think right now what we are reacting to is the fact that over the last decade or so there has been little enforcement in the US, when it comes to unilateral conduct cases, which in Europe are called abuse of dominance. Part of that is, there is a series of case law that really created a very deferential sort of approach, in which it is super hard for the Department of Justice, or the FTC, or somebody else to bring cases. But that’s just a moment in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZJhrl"&gt;If you listen to the policy debates that [are] happening right now on Capitol Hill, in universities, if you look at the people who are leading this work in the FTC and the DOJ, you can tell that we are witnessing another step in the evolution of our policy when it comes to these things, which is normal, considering that we’re facing this unprecedented technological revolution with mobile computing and these platforms achieving a level of success and influence over every aspect of the economy that not even Standard Oil or AT&amp;amp;T had at their time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU5J0V"&gt;These platforms affect every aspect of our lives to an extent that not even the Windows operating system did 20 years ago, or AT&amp;amp;T, or any of these other companies. These are unprecedented challenges that require thoughtful thinking through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL6i4y"&gt;And by the way, we are not advocates of some radical set of rules. We are super sensitive to the fact that the incentive to continue to innovate, to continue to improve technology, including the incentive for Apple to continue to improve their products, needs to be protected. But it isn’t an all-or-nothing thing. We’re talking about surgical things that go after specific decisions Apple made for self-serving purposes that we think can and should be reversed. We’re not talking about taking away Apple’s well-earned right to enjoy the fruits of their labor and their innovation of the great products that they’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vi7zn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We had Sen. Amy Klobuchar on the show a few weeks ago, she gave me the long history of American antitrust law. And certainly, Europe imported a lot of that, and then the US diverged. I take that point. But I look at the EU approach over the past 10 years and I see a lot of direct interventions in how products work in an effort to introduce competition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROsIUN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They introduced a browser ballot on Windows, they broke apart Chrome and search from Android. There’s now a search ballot in Android. The EU has been &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17996640/google-eu-android-antitrust-ruling-app-unbundling-european-commission-chrome-search"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chasing after Google&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for a decade and they have not managed to create the conditions for there to be a meaningful competitor to search. Is any of this working? In the United States, we’ve done nothing and Google is the dominant search engine. In Europe, they have done a lot of things and Google is the dominant search engine. Is there another way forward that actually creates competition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyoGHj"&gt;I think you’re right, there is a little bit of trial and error, especially when it comes to remedies. I think when you look at the cases in Europe, you may think that the particular approach that they took to try to remedy the anti-competitive behavior and try to restore market conditions, in some cases were not effective and in other cases they were somewhat effective, especially when you’re talking about mergers and some structural remedies, and things like that. But trying to balance an effective remedy that doesn’t overshoot the mark and create more harm, is very hard. There is a learning process. There is a trial and error process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck7WHj"&gt;Sometimes these cases take [a] long [time] because the rights of defense of the companies involved want to be respected. So if they were shooting from the hip and they were imposing draconian remedies, you and I would be having a completely different conversation today. I think what you’re seeing is a result of regulators that are trying to grapple with the economic implications of these things and trying to tailor remedies that solve the core of the problem without creating all of the collateral damage that we would decry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHzbck"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem in Europe is that Google has 90 percent market share, and then eight companies have a slice of 10 percent. One of those companies is Microsoft, which is not hurting for money, and their interventions have not changed that number in 10 years. It might be a targeted remedy, but I think it’s fair to ask if the remedy is effective at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J44eEt"&gt;That’s a legitimate question and I’m sure, depending on who you ask, they will give you a different answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUqJxt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think Google thinks it’s been very effective.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHCFcA"&gt;I think that sometimes, the problem you’re trying to solve, the evidence of it being solved is not necessarily going to be market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxRwsc"&gt;There [are] many reasons why a company might have reached a high market share, based on completely legitimate pro-competitive reasons, because they have a really good product, and I’m not talking about a particular case. So the measure cannot be, has the market share come down. That is the wrong way to judge these cases. The measure needs to be, are you creating space for competition? Are you creating space for a market to compete? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ETBf2"&gt;It’s incumbent upon the competitors to have products that are good enough, innovative enough, and economically attractive enough to actually challenge for market share [of] a particular product. I don’t know that you can burden one or a set of antitrust decisions with creating that outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjI8wF"&gt;What you have to do is create the environment for competition, and then see if the market decides. And, again, these companies are very innovative and a lot of what they do is legitimate, and frankly, the more competition there is, the more they will invest in innovation and the better their products will be. That is the virtual cycle that you want to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYJW2Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned there were gatekeepers, which I’m guessing is a reference to the proposed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Markets Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in Europe. That law would basically lay out a set of rules by which dominant platforms would be classified as gatekeepers, and then they would have to do a bunch of things around interoperability. There would be prohibitions against self-preferencing their own services. It would address a lot of themes that you and I have talked about. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrCyRk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last big e-regulation was the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I have a vantage point in the United States. Spotify is based in Europe, you probably feel it a lot more directly than I do. But I see the GDPR as something that created a lot of compliance costs, a lot of “I accept” buttons on the web, but maybe not more privacy. As you think about the DMA, what do you think its opportunities are and where do you think it needs to be beefed up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zy42Nm"&gt;As the person who was responsible at Spotify for insuring [that] we were complying with GDPR, and who had to persuade our CEO that we needed to dedicate dozens and dozens of engineers for almost a couple years to build the systems, I can definitely attest to how hard it was to get to a point where we feel we’re compliant with it. But I would disagree that it didn’t achieve anything. We can always find things that could work better or could criticize, but the reality has become [that] the standard by which we measure user data protection practices has really elevated the significance of this issue and made sure that companies were prioritizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz18uP"&gt;And as painful as it is and was for us to be able to comply with it, and it’s an ongoing job that we have to do every day, we actually think it is worth it. One of the biggest problems that the technology industry has today is the fact that trust, to a certain extent, has been lost with users because there are so many things there. And having a set of minimum standards, in terms of how user data is used, is something that we think would build and restore that trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iRDlDg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s like regulators trying to dig out the bones of a dinosaur, and then pondering whether it was another dinosaur or a meteorite that killed it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qsuDsO"&gt;Turning to the Digital Markets Act, at the end of the day, the reality is unless there is a new, more effective set of rules that take into account the complexity and the magnitude of these companies and the economic impact that they have and that can actually bring about a resolution in a timely fashion, we’re going to be in trouble. We’re going to end up in a world in which a couple companies are going to control most of the user data and most of internet commerce, and they’re going to essentially exact a toll from everyone. That’s not a world that we want to live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pW38UI"&gt;The problem with trying to address the modern technology competition challenges with the preexisting tools is that there’s a risk of it becoming like an archeological expedition. It’s like regulators trying to dig out the bones of a dinosaur, and then pondering whether it was another dinosaur or a meteorite that killed it. By the time that that happens, it’s ancient history. There would be scores of technology start-ups and innovative companies that would’ve been essentially extinct by that time. So how do you equip competition enforcers with the tools that they need, considering they’re facing these enormous information asymmetries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IB4xq"&gt;They’re dealing with companies that are $2 trillion companies with a global footprint. How do you equip those regulators with tools that can bring about a fair and effective result in a shorter amount of time, as opposed to, like you said, a case against Google lasting 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZyVFI"&gt;We filed our complaint two years ago [and] they announced the opening of an investigation a year ago. Only recently have they issued a preliminary finding in the form of a statement of objections. We’re still a number of years away from a decision. And we will prosecute that case until the end. But the fact that you have to wait, in the best of cases, five to 10 years until resolution, tells you that currently, the antitrust enforcement tools are not really up to the challenge of protecting the competitive process in the face of these massive online platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ47pd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned that Apple is a $2 trillion company; Spotify is up against Apple. That’s two orders of magnitude bigger than Spotify. Spotify, though, is a $45 billion company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfjV02"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We hear a lot from musicians. There is a musicians’ union that’s very mad at Spotify all the time. They say that your rates are too low, that the deal-making with labels opaque, that you’ll cut deals with big artists and labels, but you won’t negotiate with smaller ones. Do you feel competitive pressure as Spotify to make better deals with artists and labels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVSvPb"&gt;The reality is, 80 percent of the content on our platform is provided essentially by three or four content suppliers, four labels, if you think about it. These companies control 80 percent of the musical content that gets streamed on our platform. These companies have tremendous leverage over us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHdsnS"&gt;There is a reason why two-thirds of the gross revenue that Spotify generates goes back to artists and the labels and publishers and organizations that they represent. In fact, we’ve gone from zero to billions of dollars of revenue every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sY4pDp"&gt;Our margins are nowhere near what you would expect from technology [company] margins. The content industry, particularly when you’re dealing with music and you’re negotiating with a handful of incredibly powerful labels, have kept it incredibly competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX6wVm"&gt;There’s a lot of information out there and there’s a lot of passion on this topic. We’ve tried to add some transparency. A couple of months ago, we launched a website called Loud and Clear that I really encourage people to go look at because it really explains the structure of the music industries and how the streaming royalties trickle from the streaming services down ultimately to the artist, and all the players in the value chain, and the commissions or the transaction cost that is associated with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wwIKo"&gt;The reality is when Spotify was created, the music industry was in trouble. It essentially had come down to be, on a global economic basis, about half of what it was before. It was streaming that really brought the industry back to growth, where now we are really approaching the levels prior to the challenges that made the music industry shrink. And we’re very proud of the role that we played in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JffFIT"&gt;We are actually convinced that we’re only getting started, that we can all continue to grow the pie and that everyone, artists and the labels that represent them, and publishers and collective organizations and others can benefit if we do that. But we have to grow the pie, as opposed to basically pointing to the next guy and saying “I just want a bigger slice for my piece, as opposed to yours,” because at the end of the day, we’re all in the same boat. We need to lift the boats together, as opposed to turn on one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i28voq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I talk about this with every executive from a service that distributes culture, whether it’s Vimeo or Instagram or Spotify. If you were an artist in the ’70s or ’80s, you could spend two years in the studio and then release your record, sell a lot of copies of your record, and that would make all of your money for you. If you’re an artist now, your music is actually devalued because of streaming and widespread access. Today, you’re on tour all the time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vxvoK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hear the idea that you would grow the whole pie, but I think the average indie artist is saying, “How do I negotiate with Spotify? I don’t have a label. I don’t have a publishing organization. I’m just trying to make money as a musician.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgpCLr"&gt;How many indie artists in 1970 were able to actually release albums that were successful and that allowed them to reap the economic benefits that you’re describing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qsapx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an old punk-rocker. I feel like I could name a bunch of old punk-rock acts that started labels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43iPZg"&gt;The reality is there were some bottlenecks in the music industry before. You really had to be discovered by a label or create your own label, which was really the exception rather than the rule, and then you had to sign these deals, and then there was only a small percentage of new artists every year. They had to be marketed through radio, and you had to truck the vinyl records to the record stores and things like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hevqaq"&gt;What the internet has done is really eliminated a lot of the friction and a lot of the cost associated with both creating and distributing and marketing music. What that has created is a world in which there are now an incredible number of artists. And when you’re talking about independent artists, the growth of independent artists on our platforms have been remarkable. They are some of the artists that have benefited the most from the music streaming infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGypig"&gt;In 2020 alone, there were 76,000 artists that were added to Spotify playlists for the first time. And the large majority of these were discovered because they were pitching music through our playlist pitching tool. Last year, 57,000 artists represented 90 percent of the monthly streams on Spotify. And so essentially, what used to be the bottom of the pyramid has actually moved up, and there’s a much larger number of artists that are now being streamed. Artists are able to find niche audiences that were not available to them before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdvIq5"&gt;You look at the Belgian hip-hop scene, you go to the Netherlands and places like that, these are things that have been enabled because the barriers to entry into the market and to achieve global distribution have been dismantled because of the streaming business model and technology. We now have over 300 million users that are listening to music that is being monetized, and that is benefiting the creators of music and the organizations that represent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S62eTZ"&gt;It’s a constant negotiation. Everyone always wants a little bit more, their slice to be a little bit bigger. But the reality is, when you look at the economic situation of the music industry today, the industry is much better. You’re seeing a tremendous explosion of creativity, a tremendous number of international artists. You look at K-pop, Latin crossover, and things that are now popular because we created this large audience of globally-minded users that are willing to experience it. We’ve developed personalization and discovery tools that expose people to music in ways that the radio model of music marketing would have never been able to allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa1h6E"&gt;We’re very proud of that. And we’ll continue to change and learn and try new things. We’ll also continue to add transparency to the way that the economics of the music streaming world work, because we believe that the value of our contribution is not necessarily obvious for some people. We have to talk about it and understand the economic structure of the industry for people to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCI6Nd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m asking these questions because I see your relationship with Apple somewhat mirrored by the relationship creators might have with Spotify. Beyond music, Spotify has this large position in podcasting. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3mrp5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18243729/spotify-podcast-strategy-gimlet-media-anchor-purchase"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve bought a number of companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Gimlet, The Ringer, Anchor, Megaphone. Megaphone is the central player in the podcast ecosystem. Our show is distributed on Megaphone. This is great synergy for you. You’re going to talk on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and then Megaphone is going to distribute it. But that gives you a huge amount of data insight into the podcast industry that almost no one else can get. You could use that to inform programming decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDXUod"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I could take that, abstract that out, and say, “Okay, that’s the criticism of Amazon.” If I was an e-regulator looking at a law like the DMA, I might say, “Well, Megaphone is a gatekeeper.” Do you feel that pressure as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2aRsZ"&gt;I just have to tell you this sort of moral equivalence between what Apple has done with the App Store and Spotify and some other platform, I think it’s not based on fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1KT9w"&gt;We would be equivalent to Apple if we told artists and labels that they couldn’t be on the Spotify platform unless they paid us 30 percent of all the revenue that gets generated, and we get to promote certain artists that we pick over somebody else, and we get to make it super hard for artists to be able to find an audience on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFKMe6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The parallels are maybe not in the specifics, but in that feeling of, “This is a contract I can’t negotiate,” or, “This is data I don’t want to give up.” I’m wondering how you balance those out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzREum"&gt;Nobody has provided more data transparency in the music industry than we have. We created Spotify for Artists. We provided it to artists for free. They get the ability to get real-time data on how their music is performing. We added transparency in an area that was really characterized by tremendous opacity when it comes to data. And this data is incredibly valuable. It’s data that we are able to pull together because we have this incredibly large user base, and we have the technology tools to create it. So we are providing that data to artists. The feedback that we get from artists is incredibly positive when it comes to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaLUTh"&gt;We are allowing artists to find audiences that would have been very hard for them to find, including artists that have chosen to be independent and that are not signed by one of the major labels, because now there are tools that they can benefit from where, in some respects, they don’t need some of those terms. So, I take exception to the comparison. I know it’s very easy to say, “Well, these people are a platform. You guys are saying you want to be a two-sided platform. Ergo, you’re equally bad as somebody else who’s behaving badly.” But that’s not a real comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MdoFF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wouldn’t say bad. I think the challenges are similar of how you might manage a platform. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Prs3MT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me bring these two threads together, I’m seeing across the entire range of other social apps this huge push towards tipping. Twitter’s going to let you tip people who are good at tweeting. They’re going to let you do ticketed events. Clubhouse is doing tips. Down the line, you name a platform, they’re all opening the cookie jar. All those platforms have to pay Apple 30 percent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzfzWu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One class of creators that people would be most likely to pay for are artists. If I love some indie band that’s mad about their rates from Spotify, they could tell their listeners, “Listen to this on Spotify, but kick us five bucks.” Is that a service that you just won’t offer because of the Apple tax right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A04k0b"&gt;I won’t say that we will never offer it. I think it is hard because of the set of rules that Apple has. I can’t comment on what might or might not be in the product roadmap. And there is nothing intrinsically related to tipping that would cause us not to consider it, if we can make it work from a technology and economic perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUoI3F"&gt;Some of that means trying to figure out these App Store rules, and some of it is making sure that the market is there for that. We are looking for different ways in which we can create monetization avenues for creators. When we have something to say about that, we’ll come out and announce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwUapu"&gt;We have announced the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;paid podcast opportunities&lt;/a&gt;. I think tomorrow [we] begin the rollout of the program. So, in terms of podcast monetization, the ability of podcasters to be able to monetize on our platform by having their direct subscription and payment relationship with users, that is something that we have announced. So we are trying to create those opportunities, and we’re trying to actually learn from Apple’s mistakes and trying not to replicate them in the way we run our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhIasa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The paid podcast execution is really interesting. There is not a button in Spotify that lets you spend money inside of Spotify to pay for a podcast. You have to leave, go to Anchor on the web, and sign up over there. That feels like trying to avoid this platform tax situation in a way, that doing that for whatever number of artists at scale would be almost impossible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtVfdk"&gt;Obviously, if we can avoid having to pay the Apple tax, we will do it. We will create ways consistent with the law and consistent with the sound business practices that would allow us to create that. We thought we did that in 2016 when we took Apple’s in-app payment system down. One of the first things we did when I joined Spotify was actually look at the rules, the app developer guidelines. It was, I think, Section 311 at the time. We spent weeks looking at that rule and all it required for us was not to have a “Buy” button on the app for subscriptions. All we had to do was not to have an explicit link to an external payment site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdO2AX"&gt;The reason we took it down is, we were in this situation where they had forced us to increase our consumer prices to $12.99 per month. And then they bought Beats Music, rebranded it [as Apple Music], and launched it at $9.99. So now they were undercutting us in price because we had to pay them the 30 percent. At that point, it was inevitable. We had no choice. We had to take the IAP down. And we did it in compliance with the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3aKTB"&gt;What did [Apple] do? They changed the rules the month after to retroactively make the stance we had taken a violation of the rules. Since then, they’ve amended the rules two more times in ways that give them ever-expanding powers to basically control the way in which we run our business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvTxAK"&gt;The facts speak for themselves, whatever you think about Apple as a company and the history of Apple. I have a lot of respect for it, and I actually have a lot of respect for a number of friends that I know who work for Apple. But you have to call out the areas in which they’ve behaved in a way that’s not right. That’s what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNP3g5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re a good lawyer. I know you’re not going to make a prediction about the trial. But make a sweeping prediction. Where do you think this overall platform regulation energy comes from next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UqVWv5"&gt;I think you’ve seen companies from every slice of the technology industry come out. You’ve seen media companies come out. You’ve seen a number of other companies come out. I think this is irreversible. I think the calls for sound but effective regulation are unstoppable. And I think a couple years from now, there will be strong pieces of legislation as well as law enforcement and competition law enforcement decisions that will begin the process of laying the foundations for how competition in technology markets should be conducted in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new collective will share a podcast feed to make money off Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWavj-6iaZPbDMHmf5NgQ6UEd-s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370786/acastro_210430_1777_audioApps_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fc1z17"&gt;A new collective is trying to solve the live audio monetization problem. A group of primarily tech-focused hosts are launching a shared podcast feed that’ll round up the many social audio chats they’ve started, with plans to run ads across the collected feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feIM4q"&gt;The group, which is being spearheaded by &lt;em&gt;Techmeme Ride Home&lt;/em&gt; host &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brianmcc"&gt;Brian McCullough&lt;/a&gt;, will initially involve nine total contributors, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kantrowitz"&gt;Alex Kantrowitz&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt; newsletter and product designer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina"&gt;Chris Messina&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll share a podcast feed where they can publish audio they’ve recorded live across various social audio platforms, like Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, and that feed, which is already live but hasn’t been publicly announced, is called &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/spacecasts/id1568772123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceCasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who participates can publish their live audio on the feed and profit from whatever ad sales are made. (The team says anyone can apply to participate and says people can get in touch &lt;a href="https://www.ridehome.info/p/spaces/"&gt;through their website&lt;/a&gt;. They also say they’ll ask all live room participants to say they’re okay with being recorded.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EXzGFB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A buffet of different topics from people who are experts but also have their own perspective”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OtmJe"&gt;The big idea is that this solves two problems: one is that dedicating resources to putting together social audio rooms is hard to justify when there’s no major, native way to make money off a show that’ll disappear the moment it ends. The next is that launching an individual podcast is also difficult and requires marketing to grow. Sharing a podcast feed with others means everyone shares the goal of growing the feed and bringing listeners to it. Ad money, which the group hasn’t made yet, will be divvied up by downloads. So if one member contributes only one show in a given month, but accounts for 20 percent of the downloads, they’ll receive 20 percent of the revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vju5J6"&gt;“What we’re saying is, ‘Look, take the stuff that’s actually good that you’ve recorded and that you think you know could be of interest to this broader audience, and we’ll collect an audience that is interested in kind of a potpourri or like a buffet of different topics from people who are experts but also have their own perspective on on this stuff,’” Messina says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl3SDT"&gt;This all speaks to social audio’s focus on making it easier to get people in one place to record something — and its lack of focus on monetization or native recording. Twitter says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321158/twitter-spaces-record-conversation-kayvon-beykpour"&gt;it’s working on&lt;/a&gt; a native recording function, but that hasn’t launched yet, and Clubhouse has launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"&gt;in-app tipping&lt;/a&gt;, which is helpful, but doesn’t monetize actual chats. Some creators have started partnering with brands on their Clubhouse rooms, and entire agencies have spun up to sell ads for them. But a podcast feed still remains the best way to widely distribute recorded audio that can live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 variants get new names based on Greek alphabet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5dXmi4CP-3SWkCSm_PG8StiugU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370503/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7MIlrm"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming system for notable variants of virus that causes COVID-19 based on letters of the Greek alphabet. The new names aren’t intended to replace official scientific designations, but it’s hoped they’ll provide labels that are easier to remember and say than alphanumeric names, and less stigmatizing than the informal use of countries’ names to identify new variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEXRuW"&gt;The WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/"&gt;has a list&lt;/a&gt; of existing “variants of concern” and “variants of interest” that have been given new labels under the Greek alphabet naming scheme. “Alpha” refers to B.1.1.7, the variant first documented in the UK, while “Delta” is B.1.617.2, which was first documented in India. In total, the WHO has already used 10 letters of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet"&gt;24 letter strong Greek alphabet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dVNLIF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The labels do not replace existing scientific names, which convey important scientific information &amp;amp; will continue to be used in research. The naming system aims to prevent calling &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; variants by the places where they are detected, which is stigmatizing &amp;amp; discriminatory. &lt;a href="https://t.co/MwWGGMXPjn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MwWGGMXPjn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1399436524341628933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pLudvZ"&gt;Although naming diseases after geographical locations has a long history that includes the Ebola virus (named after the Congolese river) and the Spanish Flu, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/01/covid-19-variants-to-be-given-greek-alphabet-names-to-avoid-stigma"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, its informal usage has become contentious. Former president Donald Trump referred to COVID-19 as the “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-trump-chinese-virus/"&gt;Chinese Virus&lt;/a&gt;” on more than one occasion, which has been cited as contributing to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/18/joe-biden-anti-asian-american-hate-crimes-bill"&gt;wave of hate crimes&lt;/a&gt; against Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the US. The WHO calls the practice of referring to variants by their place of detection “stigmatizing and discriminatory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAH71k"&gt;“No country should be stigmatised for detecting and reporting variants,” WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said in comments reported by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2OWnm"&gt;The name COVID-19 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133107/coronavirus-name-covid19-illness-who-new"&gt;officially given to the disease&lt;/a&gt; in February 2020. Prior to its official naming, the illness was colloquially referred to as “Wuhan pneumonia” or “Wuhan flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNmHgy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KZGWB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung and AMD are working on an Exynos mobile chip with ray tracing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9EFWuWp6_PA3ApR-ZpFhCgqc4r4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370311/acastro_180529_1777_amd_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lOEUL9"&gt;AMD is partnering with Samsung to provide RDNA 2 graphics technology for an Exynos mobile system-on-chip, potentially giving a boost to GPU performance in flagship Samsung phones. The announcement was made today at Computex Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiUmQJ"&gt;There aren’t many details on the chip or which products it’ll be used in, but AMD describes the chip as a “next-generation Exynos SoC,” and says Samsung will provide further information later in 2021. The GPU will use AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture, enabling features like ray tracing and variable rate shading. AMD says it’ll make its way to “flagship mobile devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOdZ7n"&gt;“The next place you’ll find RDNA 2 will be the high-performance mobile phone market,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said on stage. “AMD has partnered with industry leader Samsung for several years to accelerate graphics innovation in the mobile market, and we’re happy to announce that we’ll bring custom graphics IP to Samsung’s next flagship mobile SoC with ray tracing and variable rate shading capabilities. We’re really looking forward to Samsung providing more details later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JGaawR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s DLSS is coming this month","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462659/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lrMFh4"&gt;Exynos is the brand name that Samsung uses for its own in-house processors. In the US and certain other markets, Samsung’s flagship Galaxy phones ship with Snapdragon SoCs from Qualcomm, while the rest of the world gets Exynos chips. The Exynos models are &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16463/snapdragon-888-vs-exynos-2100-galaxy-s21-ultra"&gt;generally regarded&lt;/a&gt; as slightly less performant than their Qualcomm equivalents, but it was seen as a surprise when Samsung decided to switch to the Snapdragon variant of the Galaxy S20 in its home market of South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTcwwC"&gt;Whether AMD’s mobile solution will provide tangible benefits over Qualcomm’s Adreno GPUs is unknown. But by throwing out buzzwords like ray tracing and lending its latest RDNA 2 architecture, AMD is certainly setting expectations high for future Samsung devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="BlbFIy"&gt;Dennis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel getting a 4K release this year. That’s because the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; adaptation, made in 1984 by a young David Lynch, is getting a limited edition 4K Blu-ray release on August 30th. The film was both a critical and box office bomb that Lynch &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/dune-1984-david-lynch-disowned-adaptation/"&gt;later disowned&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s also a fascinating historical artifact and sci-fi cult-classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2WED6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arrowfilms.com/product-detail/dune-limited-edition-uhd/FCD2175"&gt;Arrow Films&lt;/a&gt;, the distributor handling the release, says the 4K restoration is sourced from the film’s original camera negative, scanned at 4K 2160p and mastered in Dolby Vision HDR. It also includes uncompressed stereo audio and a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfrkRu"&gt;There are two versions of the 4K release available to pre-order: a standard edition containing the film along with a bonus disc of extra content, and a steelbook edition which adds a third non-4K Blu-ray disc containing the HD version of the film. Extra features include brand new audio commentaries (from film historian Paul M. Sammon and podcaster Mike White), a new feature-length documentary, and mix of new and old featurettes. It will be available to buy in the UK, US, and Canada when it releases next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRNbpa"&gt;It’d probably be an understatement to say the original &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; got a mixed reception upon its release. Critic &lt;a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dune-1984"&gt;Robert Ebert called&lt;/a&gt; it “an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time.” But the story of how it came to be is fascinating, with Ridley Scott being attached to direct at one point before he dropped out and directed &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; instead. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/looking-back-at-all-the-utterly-disastrous-attempts-to-adapt-dune.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt; has&lt;/a&gt; a good timeline of the struggles various filmmakers have been through over the years trying to adapt the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLiEf0"&gt;Meanwhile, the 2021 &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;adaptation is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21453047/dune-delay-release-date-warner-bros-wonder-woman-disney-marvel-black-widow"&gt;due to release on October 1st&lt;/a&gt;, when it will be available simultaneously to watch in cinemas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;as well as HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in 4K HDR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD confirms it’s powering the gaming rig inside Tesla’s Model S and Model X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pyFj20Uw58zBJNhb_B4cP2MCO4=/0x0:1201x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370119/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wT9bK6"&gt;Remember when Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop"&gt;claimed you’d be able to play &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a 10 teraflop gaming rig he’s stuffing into the new Tesla Model S and X? AMD is officially providing the guts — during its Computex 2021 keynote, the chipmaker just revealed that the new Tesla infotainment system consists of an AMD Ryzen processor paired with an AMD RDNA 2 GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0Yhi2"&gt;“So we actually have an AMD Ryzen APU powering the infotainment system in both cars as well as a discrete RDNA2-based GPU that kicks in when running AAA games, providing up to 10 teraflops of compute power.... we look forward to giving gamers a great platform for AAA gaming,” says AMD CEO Lisa Su. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qxvvU"&gt;And if you combine that information with another piece of news AMD revealed today, plus a earlier leak in January, we may now have a passing idea of how powerful that “10 teraflop” infotainment system could theoretically be: likely a little less than Sony’s PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDV7hC"&gt;You see, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickschur_/status/1354854817697566723"&gt;leaker Patrick Schur dug up a Tesla block diagram in January&lt;/a&gt; that singled out an AMD Navi 23 GPU specifically for Tesla’s new vehicles, and today AMD announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/31/22457181/amd-radeon-rx-6000m-series-release-date-rdna2-rog-strix-g15"&gt;the new Radeon 6800M, 6700M and 6600M&lt;/a&gt; laptop graphics chips — the weakest of which just so happens to use Navi 23, &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16721/amd-announces-radeon-rx-6000m-series-rdna2-breaks-into-laptops"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rIVB3G"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Q7A1zJGtm0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Q7A1zJGtm0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Schur (@patrickschur_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickschur_/status/1354854817697566723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SHCd10"&gt;As we learned today, that Radeon 6600M chip comes with 28CUs and 1792 shader units— compared to the 36CUs and an estimated 2304 shader units worth of RDNA 2 GPU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185141/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-comparison-specs-features-release-date"&gt;in Sony’s PlayStation 5,&lt;/a&gt; which also claims to be a 10-teraflop gaming rig. While it’s not quite apples-to-apples, it’s largely the same technology beneath, and a smaller number of cores on the same GPU architecture suggests we should expect slightly less performance from a Tesla compared to Sony’s console. (The higher-end Radeon 6700M / Navi 22 has the same number of CUs as the PS5, for what it’s worth.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOfZnp"&gt;Performance depends on the software platform, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21718936/xbox-series-x-ps5-performance-game-comparison"&gt;as we’ve seen with the 10-teraflop PS5 and the 12-teraflop Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; — and a recent job posting by Tesla suggests game developers may actually be building for Linux if they want to target the new Tesla in-car gaming rigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T7u5td"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For my gamer/dev/gamedev followers: we're looking for Linux game devs to work on something *extremely* exciting at Tesla!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're interested, DM me!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  : &lt;a href="https://t.co/dPcr4SlhpW"&gt;https://t.co/dPcr4SlhpW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/94GOmPUWjs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/94GOmPUWjs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel James (@ATTlKA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ATTlKA/status/1397258716076937216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNQzIW"&gt;Linux isn’t necessarily a benefit when it comes to gaming performance, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272809/google-stadia-specs-amd-teraflops-cloud-gaming"&gt;Google’s Stadia cloud gaming also boasted 10 teraflops of performance from its AMD GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, but ports of games from Bungie and Square Enix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;didn’t look nearly as good as they did on weaker Xbox and PC hardware&lt;/a&gt; at the service’s launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RybmF7"&gt;The most important question is probably still the one I asked back in January, though: Who is going to sit in their $80,000 sports car and play a triple-A video game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPYEAA"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;tweeted on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that the Model S Plaid, which includes the new AMD system, will start deliveries on June 10th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s DLSS is coming this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OgsvWN_jxmFl8d7NLlfR9RwHp70=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370100/acastro_180529_1777_amd_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BMmYdz"&gt;AMD has announced that FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), its super sampling technique that should boost performance and image quality in supported games, will launch on June 22nd. The company gave a presentation at Computex Taipei today with more information on the feature, though it’s still not clear just how effective it’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFp0NT"&gt;AI-powered super sampling is a major point of differentiation between AMD’s GPUs and those from its competitor Nvidia. DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), Nvidia’s version of the technique, uses neural networks to reconstruct images at higher quality from lower resolutions in real time, enabling games to run at smoother frame rates without compromising the image quality. Nvidia launched DLSS back in 2018 with the RTX 20- series, and it’s has been increasing performance and support ever since. More than 50 games now work with DLSS, and Nvidia itself just announced today that &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six Siege&lt;/em&gt; are getting the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4BlEq"&gt;AMD first said it was working on super sampling last year when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538010/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-specs-release-date-price-big-navi-gpu-graphics"&gt;announced the RX 6000-series GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. The company isn’t providing too many technical details on the feature just yet, but says it will be open source and that more than ten studios and engines will support it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cm0KISn6GqHlvzMlwx6vEp_gVDg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551654/cpd18.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l66FCJ"&gt;FSR will support four levels of scaling. In AMD’s own testing, running &lt;em&gt;Godfall&lt;/em&gt; on a Radeon RX 6800 XT with epic graphic settings and ray tracing, the performance mode ran at 150fps — a huge increase over the native rendering result of 49fps. The balanced, quality, and ultra quality modes turned in results of 124fps, 99fps, and 78fps respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7VMtC"&gt;Because FSR is open-source, it’ll also run on Nvidia GPUs, including 10-series models that don’t support DLSS. AMD is claiming a 41-percent performance increase in quality mode for &lt;em&gt;Godfall&lt;/em&gt; on a GTX 1060, for example, boosting the frame rate from 27fps to 38fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wi1U9G"&gt;Companies’ own benchmarks should never be taken at face value, of course, and the results aren’t all that meaningful without being able to see the effects on image quality with our own eyes. AMD has not shown off much evidence of how FSR actually works in practice — but we won’t have too much longer to find out, as it’ll be available in three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia announces new RTX 3080 Ti, priced at $1,199 and launching June 3rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jtarg1iyuB9zqcs5cJsYDoIEWYs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370004/RTX_3080_TI_Render.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a2e540"&gt;Nvidia is unveiling its latest flagship gaming GPU today, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Based on Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer"&gt;latest Ampere architecture&lt;/a&gt;, the RTX 3080 Ti will succeed the RTX 3080 and promises to deliver 1.5x more performance over the previous generation RTX 2080 Ti. Nvidia is making the RTX 3080 Ti available worldwide on June 3rd, priced from $1,199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfywvP"&gt;The RTX 3080 Ti looks very much like the RTX 3080, with an identical design and ports. The main difference is a jump in power and VRAM. The RTX 3080 Ti ships with more VRAM than the RTX 3080, with 12GB of GDDR6X in total. This new GPU is essentially as close as you can get to an RTX 3090 on paper, with half the VRAM. The $1,199 price matches the same pricing Nvidia used for the RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition cards, and it’s $300 less than the giant RTX 3090.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LRwhGO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10526869"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtolvU"&gt;You’re obviously losing out on an extra 12GB of VRAM if you opt for the RTX 3080 Ti over the 3090, and what will likely be a small improvement in performance for that $300 difference. But the RTX 3090 is giant because it has a far bigger cooler, and the RTX 3080 Ti has the same hardware design as the RTX 3080. That may prompt concerns around how hot the RTX 3080 Ti will run, but we’ll have to wait on reviews to find out if it’s really an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jiMIj"&gt;Nvidia is also including its cryptocurrency nerf on the RTX 3080 Ti, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;new RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 cards&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia offers a separate &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/cmp/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22205888__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptocurrency Mining Processor&lt;/a&gt; (CMP) for Ethereum miners instead. These cards include the best performance for mining and efficiency, but they’re not designed to handle games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIgn9x"&gt;Elsewhere, the RTX 3080 Ti has the same power requirements as the RTX 3090. You’ll need a 750-watt power supply, and the card can draw up to 350 watts of power. That’s the same as the RTX 3090, but the RTX 3080 draws less at up to 320 watts. Just like the RTX 3080 before it, the 3080 Ti also uses Nvidia’s new 12-pin connector. Nvidia will include an adapter that’s compatible with eight-pin cables.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENlM1RHmlKY8sboEfzFvRpGqa98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551570/nmtfAPF.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti also arrives this month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IVK6da"&gt;Nvidia is also launching a second GPU next week, the RTX 3070 Ti. The $599 RTX 3070 Ti will be available on June 10th, and is designed to offer 1.5x more performance over the previous RTX 2070 Super. It will include 8GB of GDDR6X memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZe9j1"&gt;Both new RTX cards will support all of Nvidia’s ray-tracing, DLSS, and Reflex technologies. More than 50 games now support Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), offering AI-powered performance boosts to games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiazwG"&gt;While both of Nvidia’s new GPUs will be available this month, actual availability and pricing is obviously going to differ. Everyone has had a hard time getting hold of new RTX 30-series GPUs since their launch last year, and a flagship RTX 3080 Ti and more affordable RTX 3070 Ti isn’t going to help improve that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y19Jgo"&gt;A global chip shortage has pushed GPU prices up, and demand is still incredibly high during ongoing supply constraints. Nvidia has already warned these supply issues will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;continue throughout 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t expect to easily be able to get hold of an RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3070 Ti any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
