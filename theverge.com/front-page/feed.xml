    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;are launching officially on September 20th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but you can test them in the public beta right now if you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs. Here, we walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for the iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;As expected, Apple announced the release date at its September event, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;it also showed off the new iPhone 13, iPad Mini with USB-C charging, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain some bugs. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdqQYd6S1VclYKqBImQmlJQ5trA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643660/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. For example, FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhlCIp"&gt;SharePlay, which will allow people to enjoy streaming entertainment together at the same time, was one of iOS 15’s most anticipated features, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple recently decided that it won’t arrive&lt;/a&gt; in the final version of iOS 15 launching on September 20th. Instead, it’ll arrive later in fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RjIx6e"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the home screen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Tern GSD S10 LX electric cargo bike review: no more excuses</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A powerful, impressive cargo bike in its own right, but it’s really all about the accessories &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L8CQmD"&gt;For certain parents, especially those in the US, the decision whether to take the kids to school on a bike or in a car often hinges on the weather. Sunshine and blue skies make it an easy choice to take the bike. But when the clouds roll in and there’s a hint of rain in the air, the idea of arriving with two soggy kids on the rear rack often steers some parents reluctantly toward the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flpkO2"&gt;Bad weather is just an excuse, really. People in other, more bike-friendly countries will ride in all seasons. Are they made of heartier stuff than us car-coddled Americans? Yes, but maybe we don’t actually need ice in our veins to ride through blizzards and hurricanes. Maybe we just need better accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cG7lOt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Taiwanese bike company’s GSD is already one of the best cargo bikes on the market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UtmxiA"&gt;Thankfully, Tern has a solution to help make these decisions a lot easier. The Taiwanese bike company’s GSD is already one of the best cargo bikes on the market. But with the addition of the Storm Shield, which provides an impressive layer of protection for passengers on the rear rack, you may be tempted to ride right into the eye of the storm, come hell or high water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4tfF8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10754781"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnHA6Y"&gt;Let’s start with the bike itself. Tern first introduced the GSD in 2017, and since then it’s released several updated models. I tested the top-line model, the GSD S10 LX with the Bosch Cargo Line motor. Tern loaned me its Storm Shield, Storm Box, and Clubhouse accessories as well. Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="X8bsLu"&gt;Motor: Bosch Cargo Line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="m5FUDD"&gt;Top speed: 20mph (32km/h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f7mWtY"&gt;Range: 32-65 miles with single-battery configuration &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CDuV07"&gt;Battery: 500Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H6juO4"&gt;Weight: 71.7lbs (32.5kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="L8PADh"&gt;Brakes: Magura MT5 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uK21OB"&gt;Drive: Chain driven Shimano 10-speed geared hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w6Sh0L"&gt;Tires: 20 inches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NAjEC5"&gt;Extras: SunTour suspension front fork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V5otdl"&gt;Price: $5,499&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-x7BQHb_scVAFZl7Thlfzw6UJwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541913/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GSD is a workhorse e-bike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VY4nHfIRckSJ4Yn3MLJEIUY3w8A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541917/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bosch mid-drive motor is especially powerful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cvf5S0FufbP_WX-Ssg6cVCzu1JA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541915/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GSD’s price may turn some people away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PDJcLiVzp3Z22FB58xXUQF43uM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541916/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not the most powerful e-bike, but the GSD makes up for it with its ability to haul lots of stuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxuSb3"&gt;Looking at this bike, you may be left scratching your head at the design. The GSD doesn’t look like a traditional bike, with its small wheels and angular step-through frame. The back half of the bike frame is a mess of intersecting triangles and trapezoids. But looks are deceiving. The wheelbase is only slightly longer than most single-occupancy bikes, which matters a lot for storage and transportation, whether rolled onto a train or mounted to the back of your car. It’s also narrower than front-bucket designs from European companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21269590/carqon-cargo-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;Urban Arrow and Carqon&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to maneuver more easily through tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1RplA"&gt;Much like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274747/tern-hsd-p9-ebike-review-electric-cargo-bike-price-specs"&gt;smaller-but-no-less-capable sibling, the HSD&lt;/a&gt;, the Tern GSD is a workhorse e-bike with a bevy of made-to-impress components that help make biking feel seamless. It’s a mid-tail cargo bike, meaning it’s big enough to fit two kids on the rear rack while also being compatible with a hitch bike rack. It has a longer wheelbase than most traditional bikes, but is still considered shorter than a longtail cargo bike. The Tern GSD can carry up to 440 pounds including the bike, rider, cargo, and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuGkJB"&gt;The GSD is easy to store thanks to Tern’s commitment to bringing some element of its folding bike technology to most models in its e-bike lineup. The GSD’s handlebars can fold down, and the entire bike can be stored vertically thanks to the bumpers on the rear rack. That said, it’s still a cargo bike, so you’ll need to take into account the size of the bike and its storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4tcWfp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the things I admire in Tern’s lineup is the flexibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5ALuU"&gt;One of the things I admire in Tern’s lineup is the flexibility. The low-step frame combined with the handlebars and seat post that can be raised and lowered without any tools, as well as a custom SunTour front suspension fork, help make this a bike that can easily be passed around among family members or friends. Riders of all shapes and sizes will feel at ease on the GSD. I’m six-foot-one, and while I usually appreciate a larger sized bike frame, the GSD’s one-size-fits-all frame did not put me off in the slightest. The riding style is more upright than your typical racing or road bike, which can take some getting used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7vsE6"&gt;The GSD is a Class 1 electric bike in the US, meaning it’s pedal-assist with no throttle and a top speed of 20mph. There were times when I missed the twist throttle, especially when getting started from a standstill on a steep incline with a kid and extra cargo on the rear rack. The Shimano 10-speed gearing system certainly helps. But I also understand why some manufacturers avoid the throttle — and honestly believe that throttles will eventually run into regulatory issues in the future — so I try not to begrudge any bike for its exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GetDU"&gt;The Cargo Line motor is one of Bosch’s most powerful systems, designed specifically for e-bikes that carry lots of weight. It’s also a step up from the Bosch Performance line motors in the earlier models. The S10 LX comes with either a 500Wh or a 1,000Wh system with a motor that provides 85 Newton-meters of torque and up to 400 percent pedal assistance in its highest setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b7ZA3dTb5uEhjGwdx5lsL3e3UWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541910/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, I realize the Storm Shield is installed backward. So what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="al8OrN"&gt;Performance-wise, I wasn’t that impressed with the 500Wh battery pack, and if I had the money, I would definitely invest in the second battery. While Tern claims the GSD has a range of 32-62 miles (52-105km), I found myself needing to recharge the battery after as little as 20 miles of riding in the highest assist level on mostly flat surfaces with a few steep hills mixed in. The motor lacked some of the torque that you would find in a smaller, more nimble e-bike. And while the top speed is listed as 20mph, I was only able to hit that while going downhill. With a low center of gravity, the stability was great and it handled well as I biked through my suburban small town.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcX6I7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GSD stands for “get stuff done”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A8Taxo"&gt;GSD stands for “get stuff done”; that’s exactly what I did while I had it: took the kids to school, went grocery shopping, used it for all the little, ticky-tacky errands for which I might normally have used the car. All told, during a month of testing, I probably put 150-200 miles on it. I’m not trying to sound like a broken record, but e-bikes are car replacements, full stop. They get a lot of shit from the cycling community because they take a lot of the effort out of cycling, but that’s exactly the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atGTSu"&gt;The Tern GSD exemplifies their potential. If you live in the US, you’ve been conditioned into believing you need a car for daily life. And you probably do, because your community has been built to exclude most other forms of transportation in the interest of making driving as frictionless as possible. E-bikes, especially cargo ones like the GSD, can help smash through that conditioning and invite you to live in a cleaner, healthier, more sustainable world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bt25DOizidS8T8D6ognqswjwZWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541908/ahawkins_20210328_4600_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This all-weather bike makes biking year-round more pleasurable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XcjzAl"&gt;Let’s get down off the soapbox and talk about accessories, because that’s what really turned me on to the GSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1XQ0L"&gt;In addition to loaning me the GSD, Tern also provided a bevy of cool add-ons, including two 52-liter panniers and three other accessories called the Clubhouse, Storm Box, and Storm Shield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNJ0Ur"&gt;The Clubhouse is essentially a seat pad with a backrest for the rack and rail that surrounds the whole thing to prevent passengers from falling off. The Storm Box provides a waterproof covering for their legs, while the Storm Shield is a waterproof nylon canopy that fits over the rack, with side panels that roll up or down depending on the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol8tSH"&gt;Altogether, Tern calls it the Clubhouse Fort, and my kids definitely treated it like their own private funhouse. Every morning, they couldn’t wait to hop on board for the 3.5-mile ride to their school. At the end of my testing period, I found all manner of gummy snacks and Goldfish crackers at the bottom of the Storm Box. I didn’t mind it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tk3dQF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be sure, it’s not cheap to outfit your bike with all these accessories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RW1IlE"&gt;To be sure, it’s not cheap to outfit your bike with all these accessories. The panniers ($250 for two), Clubhouse ($240), Storm Box ($220), and Storm Shield ($220) are all pretty expensive, especially in aggregate. And when added to the price tag for the GSD — $5,499 for single battery configuration, $6,299 for the dual-battery — you’re looking at an overall price tag of over $7,000, which is just stunning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8JbS6"&gt;Pricier than your average 10-speed, sure, but think about it in comparison to the costs of car ownership. For vehicles driven 15,000 miles a year, average car ownership costs were $9,561 a year, or $797 a month, in 2020, according to AAA. That figure includes depreciation, loan interest, fuel, insurance, maintenance and fees. In other words, the highest-spec Tern cargo bike, complete with all the fixin’s, is the equivalent of about nine months of car ownership in the US. Not a bad tradeoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvCXOs"&gt;Sure, I wish Tern were a bit cheaper — and you can certainly find cargo bikes with a similar array of accessories for less money — but I also know that the company puts a lot of effort into building some of the best e-bikes on the market today. They’re versatile, reliable, and powerful. But they also can help liberate you from the constraints of car ownership. To me, that’s worth the price alone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 is a pitch-perfect iPhone 12S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUFXBjqnWjabkSZro3YqcNX8z84=/0x0:1959x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862804/iphone13mini.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13, featuring a very similar design to the iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JI022T"&gt;Apple had a lot of new features to announce with its iPhone 13 lineup this week. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; have better battery life, faster A15 Bionic processors, smaller display notches, upgraded cameras, and, when it comes to the Pro models, high refresh rate 120Hz ProMotion displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwsNDn"&gt;It’s a nice collection of updates, but take a step back and the range starts to look an awful lot like an iterative update over last year’s iPhone 12. They have an almost identical look to the squared-off design introduced with last year’s models, and Apple was careful to not directly compare the performance of its new A15 Bionic chip to last year’s A14 Bionic, only to its competitors. There’s also no major new initiative like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that Apple kicked off last year, and on the bottom of the phones you’ll see the same old Lightning port rather than USB-C. It all feels very familiar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lcv5Zw"&gt;So it’s no wonder that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheTechChap/status/1437847213594587136"&gt;much&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbhyudayaMohan/status/1437843526323040261"&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1437837861454106626"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; immediately responded to the phones’ announcement by referring to them as the “iPhone 12S,” aka a minor update to last year’s iPhone 12. That’s how Apple used to name its phones. There’d be a major update one year, usually with a big design change, followed up with a more minor revision that changed some internal components and features but kept the overall look and feel the same. The iPhone 3GS, 4S, 5S, 6S, and XS all used this approach. So what changed?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 5S 1024" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SL25tWylCs3ChepHV76_qzTKiCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13062703/IMG_3022-1024.1419979922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Michael Shane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 5S, which added a fingerprint sensor to Apple’s smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GGPTl4"&gt;Apple started to move away from this formula with 2016’s iPhone 7. Not only did the iPhone 7 break the cycle by using a very similar design to the previous year’s 6S instead of a new look (aside, of course, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12823596/apple-iphone-7-no-headphone-jack-lightning-earbuds"&gt;infamous missing headphone jack&lt;/a&gt;), but it was never followed by an S-model of its own. Instead, the next year Apple jumped straight to the iPhone 8, a minor revision that absolutely deserved to be called the 7S, and which ended up being completely overshadowed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;that year’s iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsSCKp"&gt;Ever since 2018’s iPhone XS, it seems like Apple has abandoned the S-suffix entirely. Every year gets a new number, regardless of whether it offers a major overhaul like the iPhone 12 or a more minor update like the iPhone 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNdWnB"&gt;Of course, Apple’s closest competitor in the US, Samsung, has been using this approach for years. Every subsequent Galaxy S device has had a bigger number than its predecessor, and nobody wants to be the company with the lower-numbered phone than its rival. In fact, if Apple &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;released an iPhone 7S in 2017 it would have competed against Samsung’s Galaxy S8. No wonder Apple jumped straight to 8 and skipped the iPhone 9 entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqP5Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s wild in retrospect that Apple willingly advertised its “off” years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WKhPf"&gt;In retrospect it seems absolutely wild that Apple was willing to proudly broadcast that it was having an off year. Unless you were the kind of smartphone user that wanted to have the most up-to-date iPhone year after year, that S-suffix was a helpful indication that a new model only contained minor changes. “Don’t worry about upgrading this year, folks,” was the implicit message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXO6qh"&gt;But the reality was that smartphone technology was advancing so quickly at the time that even a “minor” upgrade could still contain massive new features. The iPhone 3GS was the first iPhone that could officially record video in addition to taking photos, the iPhone 4S introduced Apple’s Siri voice assistant to the world, and the 5S was the first iPhone with biometric security (a fingerprint sensor). These are all major additions that we now take for granted on modern Apple devices, and they arrived with the relatively muted fanfare of an S-branded iPhone. The S-branded iPhones also offered big camera improvements over the years: the 4S was the first with an 8-megapixel camera, the 5S added slow-motion video, and the 6S increased the rear camera’s resolution to 12 megapixels. Every year, Apple gave its customers a pretty good reason to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iphone 6s" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/08MMY8EtNQN_-E4JW2hG6tBI1xU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4084770/iphone-6s-clean-2-15__1_.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 6S, the first iPhone with a 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="irYQi1"&gt;The smartphone market is now a very different place. Smartphones have matured, and even midrange models offer basically everything most people actually need a phone to do. Every year we’re told about the latest phones’ performance upgrades and edge-case camera improvements, but it’s nothing that’s going to completely change your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Uvi33"&gt;Consumers have noticed. Far from upgrading to the latest iPhone every year, as of 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/smartphone-users-are-waiting-longer-before-upgrading-heres-why.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; that US customers were waiting an average of over two years to upgrade their phones, while in the UK people were waiting almost 28 months. At the time, these figures were all trending upward, and it seems safe to assume that they’ve grown even longer in the two years since. It was also around this time that iPhone sales &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940562/apple-q4-2019-earnings-iphone-sales-record-revenue-slow-services-income-mac-ipad-tim-cook"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18053782/apple-earnings-q4-2018-stop-ipad-iphone-mac-unit-sales-disclosure"&gt;Apple stopped reporting on iPhone sales numbers&lt;/a&gt;, opting instead to bundle their numbers in with other device categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vil21C"&gt;Instead of focusing on big upgrades, Apple seems to be prioritizing a bigger lineup with devices to appeal to different tastes and price points. As recently as 2017, the company was selling just two flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The following year it released three (the 8, 8 Plus, and X), and last year it switched to four with the iPhone 12, 12 Mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max. With so many form factors to keep updated, it’s not surprising that big overhauls have become less common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nhsk6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People upgrade much less frequently than they once did&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYiaF"&gt;Unless you really want the latest and greatest technology, there really isn’t much of a reason to upgrade every year, and that’s a good thing! It’s much more affordable for those people who opt to buy their phones outright, and it’s worlds better for the environment. Apple may now be using more recycled materials in its devices, but manufacturing them and shipping them in the first place still uses resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBFxeT"&gt;In this context, it isn’t surprising that Apple has changed with the times. For starters, it’s making more of an effort to make money outside of hardware, like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;increasingly broad array of subscription services&lt;/a&gt; covering everything from music and video streaming, to gaming and home fitness. If it can’t make money from selling you a new iPhone every year, it’ll sure as hell try to make money from you streaming the latest season of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hty5L5"&gt;That doesn’t mean that Apple has given up on the idea of selling you a new phone every year. Far from it. If branding this year’s phones as the iPhone 13 tells us anything, it’s that Apple is more keen than ever to convince its customers to upgrade, by branding this year’s phones as an all-new range as opposed to a more modest update to the iPhone 12. The slowing progress of smartphone technology means that Apple can’t afford to rest on its laurels with an S-branded device. Everything needs to be brand-new and as exciting as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYnqtS"&gt;So yes, this year’s iPhones could, and arguably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been branded as the iPhone 12S. But the smartphone industry has changed, and Apple has changed with it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeOAFFIkXYozdeIB8E_xA9aqhlg=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/joy_con_01.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model boasts a vibrant, 7-inch display and slate of minor upgrades.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $314&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to upgrade, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $322&lt;/a&gt; and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $344&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store, where you can often find refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $260, in addition to most color configurations of the Switch Lite for $170.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The forthcoming Nintendo Switch OLED model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578368/nintendo-switch-oled-preorder-time-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;opened for preorders on July 15th&lt;/a&gt;, with the initial preorder stock selling out within minutes. The higher-end Switch model — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially goes on sale on October 8th&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxXvjE"&gt;Although preorders for both models have come and gone since initially opening, as of the time of this writing, both configurations of the Nintendo Switch OLED are unavailable for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mGEroE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, though, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; also have the Switch Pro controller for $59, knocking $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash sues New York City over law that requires it to share customer data with restaurants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wVBIjF-3e-4rxs_iqDHH7VsdU-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862468/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash is suing New York City (again) | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gTn0zE"&gt;Food delivery company DoorDash has filed yet another lawsuit against New York City, &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/09/15/doordash-stands-up-for-new-york-city-consumer-safety-and-privacy/"&gt;calling a new law&lt;/a&gt; requiring delivery companies to share customer data with restaurants “a shocking and invasive intrusion of consumers’ privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6TUED"&gt;Under the law approved in July, third-party food delivery services in the city would have to share customers’ names, phone numbers, emails, and delivery addresses with a restaurant that fulfills a DoorDash order, unless the customer opts out. In its complaint, DoorDash argues that customers entrust DoorDash with sensitive data, “that they would not entrust to small businesses that do not have similar robust data safety and security protocol.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cffxJV"&gt;The company added that in-person diners don’t typically expect to disclose sensitive personal information to restaurants. “Moreover, the Ordinance’s presumption that every customer consents to sharing their personal data—unless they specifically opt out on a per-order basis—flies in the face of prevailing privacy best practices,” the lawsuit states. And there are no guarantees that restaurants would be able to store customer data in a way that both complies with privacy laws and prevents unauthorized access, DoorDash argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGVssb"&gt;New York City councilor &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/nyc-bill-would-require-delivery-companies-share-data-restaurants"&gt;Keith Powers, introduced the legislation&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “After such a devastating year for our city’s restaurant industry, this precedent-setting law gives much needed relief to eateries to have better access to customer data and provides strong privacy protections,” Powers wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Restaurants are the lifeblood of New York’s economy and culture, and I’m proud that the City Council has stood by our local establishments and New York diners. I encourage DoorDash to drop this lawsuit immediately.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loKpZk"&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22852929/EFFNYC2311_2021.pdf"&gt;(EFF) wrote in a July letter to New York City Council&lt;/a&gt; that it “sympathize[d] with the goal to set a more level playing field for all businesses particularly after the year we have all faced,” but that it opposed the measure: “privacy should be the default of any transaction, and consumers should be asked to opt-in to sharing of their information every time it could be transferred to a new entity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9a6Sp"&gt;In addition, the EFF said, the ordinance “sets up a ripe target for hackers and data thieves who want to exploit [the customers’] information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fPPh49"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C5jl1W"&gt;Restaurants that relied on deliveries to stay open during the pandemic last year have tangled with online delivery platforms like DoorDash over some of their business practices. A pizzeria owner who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262316/doordash-pizza-profits-venture-capital-the-margins-ranjan-roy"&gt;bought his own inventory from DoorDash at a profit&lt;/a&gt; last year highlighted how the delivery companies seemed to be willing to lose money on deliveries to add more restaurants to their ecosystems. DoorDash rival Grubhub has been caught &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20680000/grubhub-seamless-fake-restaurant-website-contract-agreement"&gt;making websites that impersonated restaurants&lt;/a&gt; and listing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113876/grubhub-seamless-fake-restaurant-listings-no-permission-postmates-doordash"&gt;restaurants on its platform without their knowledge&lt;/a&gt; or permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRE28k"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666455/doordash-grubhub-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-restaurant-fee-caps-lawsuit"&gt;DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats filed suit&lt;/a&gt; against New York City over another new law that caps the amount of fees the delivery companies can collect from restaurants. The city put a temporary cap on delivery fees last June restricting the delivery platform to a maximum fee of 23 percent per order, which breaks down as 15 percent for delivery, 5 percent for having the restaurant listed on its app, and 3 percent for credit card processing fees. The platforms have been &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/delivery-providers-accused-violating-nyc-fee-cap"&gt;accused of adding other unclear fees&lt;/a&gt; on top of their delivery fees, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifacMr"&gt;In the lawsuit it filed Wednesday, DoorDash is seeking an injunction against enforcing the new customer data rule, unspecified monetary damages, and a jury trial. The law is currently slated to take effect in December, barring any court action.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress will investigate claims that Instagram harms teens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SCbSyBoVUtHtJsCkEAw6BEdNr1I=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862446/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtESNr"&gt;Two top lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee’s panel over consumer protection said they were launching a probe into Facebook after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported Tuesday that the company was aware of the harm Instagram can cause to teenage girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGVZb5"&gt;Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) announced their investigation into Facebook in a statement released Tuesday. The senators said that they were in touch with “a Facebook whistleblower” and would seek new documents and witness testimony from the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;related to the reporting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XF45Mi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is clear that Facebook is incapable of holding itself accountable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lobof9"&gt;“It is clear that Facebook is incapable of holding itself accountable. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting reveals Facebook’s leadership to be focused on a growth-at-all-costs mindset that valued profits over the health and lives of children and teens,” the lawmakers said. “When given the opportunity to come clean to us about their knowledge of Instagram’s impact on young users, Facebook provided evasive answers that were misleading and covered up clear evidence of significant harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esYAlm"&gt;House lawmakers also criticized Facebook over the &lt;em&gt;Journal’s &lt;/em&gt;new reporting, and Republicans even issued a new amendment to the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation seeking to address tech’s effects on teens. Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) introduced the measure that would direct the Federal Trade Commission to go after “unfair and deceptive acts or practices targeting our children’s mental health and privacy by social media.” The amendment failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47nd5s"&gt;Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1437859131902287874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1437859131902287874%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2F2021%2F09%2F15%2Fwikipedia-still-has-moderator-diversity-problem-its-new-chief-wants-fix-it%2F"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Big Tech has become the new Big Tobacco. Facebook is lying about how their product harms teens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hxbliv"&gt;A group of Democrats, including Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), and Lori Trahan (D-MA), penned a letter to Facebook Wednesday calling on the company to abandon its plans to launch an Instagram app for kids in light of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo3B17"&gt;“Children and teens are uniquely vulnerable populations online, and these findings paint a clear and devastating picture of Instagram as an app that poses significant threats to young people’s wellbeing,” the lawmakers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h77U00"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workhorse abruptly drops lawsuit against Postal Service over new mail truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c-p9pTzQkdRD2PP49LYp219UGDg=/0x427:2560x2134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862319/NGDVrearRight_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YCld1v"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has abandoned its lawsuit protesting the United States Postal Service’s decision to let Oshkosh Defense build the next-generation mail truck. The court accepted Workhorse’s &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.53.0.pdf"&gt;voluntary dismissal&lt;/a&gt; late Tuesday — just one day before the first oral arguments were scheduled to begin regarding the USPS’s attempt to dismiss the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4ZmAY"&gt;Workhorse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536793/workhorse-federal-bid-protest-usps-contract-oshkosh-ngdv"&gt;filed the protest&lt;/a&gt; in the US Court of Federal Claims in mid-June, nearly four months after the USPS announced that it had awarded the contract to build the next-generation mail truck to defense contractor Oshkosh, ending a contest that started in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="og8BzO"&gt;“We are pleased to learn that Workhorse Group has withdrawn its bid protest of the award of the United States Postal Service Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (“USPS NGDV”) contract to Oshkosh Defense,” a spokesperson for Oshkosh said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;[W]e are proud that the USPS selected our solution to fulfill the needs of the NGDV program. We look forward to working with our partners across the country to get these highly capable and efficient vehicles to the carriers who need them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFQdhA"&gt;In a statement, the USPS said it “remain[s] committed to modernizing our delivery fleet in service to our customers. The Postal Service is working diligently with our supplier, and looks forward to the production of our Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDV).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1tzWO2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Workhorse did not explain the decision and hasn’t responded to recent allegations of fraud&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l78g9W"&gt;Workhorse’s decision to drop the suit comes just two weeks after a short-selling research firm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652319/workhorse-fraud-sec-investigation-short-seller-fuzzy-panda"&gt;published a report on the startup&lt;/a&gt;, alleging fraud and accusing the company of hiding a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation from investors. Workhorse did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the dismissal and has not answered any questions about the accusations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvcddr"&gt;The dismissal also comes after Workhorse replaced its CEO and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;announced plans to redesign its flagship electric delivery van&lt;/a&gt;, which it had only just started making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yFcoS"&gt;The USPS set out to replace its current mail trucks in 2015, hoping to make the fleet more fuel efficient and give mail carriers modern amenities like advanced safety features and air conditioning. Workhorse was one of the few companies that stuck it out to the final bids last year, and it claimed to be the only one proposing to build an entirely electric mail fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctzaGe"&gt;But the Ohio-based company struggled as the contest dragged on, despite having some big-name companies like UPS and FedEx test some of its earlier vehicles. To keep itself afloat, Workhorse borrowed money from hedge funds and sold off parts of its business — including licensing the intellectual property for an electric pickup truck it never built to a new company started by its former CEO, Lordstown Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1r3s8"&gt;The Postal Service selected Oshkosh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, and the agency and the defense contractor revealed a new vehicle that is supposedly able to run on both gas and electric drivetrains. Oshkosh has agreed to make 50,000 to 165,000 of the trucks over 10 years. Only around 10 percent will be electric at the outset, and the ones that aren’t are supposed to be “fuel-efficient [and] low-emission,” though neither Oshkosh nor the USPS has backed up those terms with any numbers. The USPS has said it would need billions more dollars in funding to increase the number of all-electric vehicles it orders from Oshkosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKIOAK"&gt;Workhorse initially lodged an appeal with the USPS after the award was announced and then filed its bid protest in Federal Claims Court on June 16th. The USPS (and Oshkosh, which joined the case to support the agency’s defense) argued Workhorse was supposed to go through at least one more official step as laid out in the contest rules before it filed a federal lawsuit and tried to have the case dismissed on these grounds. Oral arguments on the USPS’s motion to dismiss were scheduled for Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjsuN5"&gt;The USPS has been highly secretive about the particulars of the contest and its decision to go with Oshkosh. Workhorse has alleged that Oshkosh changed its plans at the end of the contest, and that the design revealed in February was never subject to the tests that the USPS required by its own rules. Workhorse also revealed in &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.48.0.pdf"&gt;one of its own filings&lt;/a&gt; that the USPS told the startup there was at least one other all-electric entrant, and that even if the agency hadn’t selected Oshkosh, Workhorse still wouldn’t have won the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eM7Jm"&gt;Asus recently collaborated with DJ Alan Walker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with a box that becomes  DJ deck. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is a great gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is a great gaming laptop you can buy for $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MaGh3q"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. You can buy it for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="n9BvYP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tCRMB0"&gt;A gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLxhhg"&gt;SpaceX is set to launch the first fully private crew of passengers to space on Wednesday. The Inspiration4 crew, three ordinary people and a billionaire philanthropist who’s funding the mission, will board SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule on Wednesday afternoon and lift off at 8:02PM ET atop a Falcon 9 rocket, speeding toward an orbit 360 miles above the ground — farther from Earth than the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYtwHE"&gt;If all goes according to plan, the mission will mark a new milestone in the budding commercial space industry, where companies owned by billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have been racing to normalize space travel for people other than government astronauts. The mission also aims to raise $200 million for St. Jude Children’s Hospital to help fund cancer research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t7GB7"&gt;Jared Isaacman, a trained pilot and the wealthy founder of a payment processing company, will helm the mission as its commander. He bought four seats on Crew Dragon and picked three fellow passengers: Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor and St. Jude physician assistant, was tapped for the mission through St. Jude. Sian Proctor, a geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate, won a video contest hosted by Isaacman’s company, Shift4, for her seat. And Christopher Sembroski, a data engineer at Lockheed Martin, is filling the seat reserved for one of the thousands who donated to St. Jude; his ticket was passed on to him by a friend who won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="478L9z"&gt;The Space Force’s weather squadron predicts a 90 percent chance of favorable weather at liftoff time, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="482Cfy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SpaceX is about to send its first crew of private citizens to space","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22667339/spacex-inspiration4-first-all-civilian-crew-dragon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="cb7JOE"&gt;What time is liftoff? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jotIQD"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, with Crew Dragon on top, will lift off at 8:02PM ET from the company’s 39A launchpad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. The rocket’s first stage booster will detach from its second stage booster and Crew Dragon to make a return landing on a barge in the Atlantic ocean about 10 minutes since lifting off. Meanwhile, Crew Dragon will zoom toward its orbit, detaching from the Falcon 9’s second stage booster around 8:14PM ET to begin a series of thruster firings that’ll scoot the capsule higher and higher over the next hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q9wvf6"&gt;How to watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="X7JawY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pv01sSq44w"&gt;SpaceX will have a livestream&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube that will begin around 4PM ET, roughly four hours before liftoff. Netflix, which has been producing a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1433444639311237126?s=20"&gt;documentary series on the Inspiration4 mission&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine , &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBVqsqqm9AM"&gt;will also have a livestream&lt;/a&gt; on its YouTube account. Unlike missions with NASA astronauts on board, there won’t be a live stream from inside the capsule when the crew enters orbit. Instead, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inspiration4x"&gt;Inspiration4 mission’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; will be tweeting updates throughout the mission. The final episode of Netflix’s Inspiration4 series, set for release on September 30th, will center on the crew’s experience in space and show footage of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22667339/spacex-inspiration4-first-all-civilian-crew-dragon"&gt;activities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GO8fJP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 15th, 2:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds new information from a mission spokesperson on the launch’s livestream start time and mid-mission updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s the tech behind the Carolina Panthers’ giant AR cat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Vn5bsryOKFNlRIF_qwpEztuSZM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69862138/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_8.45.12_AM.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Carolina Panthers&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OsNKsp"&gt;This past weekend marked the first Sunday of the 2021 NFL season, and while it was full of exciting highlights, one may have towered over them all: the Carolina Panthers’ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Panthers/status/1437103615634726916"&gt;viral video of a giant virtual panther&lt;/a&gt; leaping around Bank of America Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zf7fJD"&gt;The video is ridiculous. A big virtual cat jumps into the stadium, paces around the field, shreds a New York Jets flag (the Panthers’ Sunday opponents), and hops away with a menacing roar. It’s proved to be hugely popular, with 5.6 million views on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s1wbFQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Check out our new mixed-reality panther that debuted today     &lt;a href="https://t.co/8DwEvam9KM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8DwEvam9KM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Panthers/status/1437103615634726916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azxS6l"&gt;While the Panthers’ tweet calls the mascot a “mixed-reality panther,” it actually seems closer to augmented reality applied on a really big scale, according to a conversation I had with Jon Slusser and CJ Davis of &lt;a href="https://www.thefamousgroup.com/#1"&gt;The Famous Group&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the virtual panther. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3AhAu"&gt;In short, what’s going on is that an animation of the virtual panther, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealEngine/status/1437428152754638849"&gt;which was made in Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;, is being rendered within a live feed of the real world. That means camera operators have to track and follow the animations of the panther in real time as it moves around the stadium, like camera operators would with an actual living animal. To give the panther virtual objects to climb on and interact with, the stadium is also modeled virtually but is invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4DSd3"&gt;This tech isn’t baked into an app, meaning you won’t be pointing your phone’s camera in the stadium to get another angle on the panther if you’re attending a game. The animations are intended to air live. In Sunday’s case, the video was broadcast live on the big screens at the stadium, and shortly after that, the video was posted to social media. (One cool tidbit: in the video, you can see that the stadium screens have black screens with cat eyes. Those were applied to prevent a mirroring effect, a PR rep for The Famous Group said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1r6Kkn"&gt;While only the one animation of the panther was shown on Sunday, Slusser and Davis said that other animations for the panther are in the works. One potential example? Appearing during a crucial third down to “hover over the opposing team and growl at them,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fa1GeT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The illusion in the viral video is clever, but it isn’t perfect&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2JXdCN"&gt;The illusion in the viral video is clever, but it isn’t perfect. The cat definitely looks like a big CGI creature. And near the end of the video, when the panther roars from the top of the Jumbotron, you can see that its feet don’t exactly align with the architecture on which it’s standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6YBh5"&gt;But the giant virtual panther is a fun look at one possible use of AR to add to the experience of watching a big sports event. That’s already something of The Famous Group’s specialty — check out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FamousGroupLA/status/1403368405965565957"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; of a giant mixed reality raven made for the Baltimore Ravens, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gcQBLd"&gt;

The M&amp;amp;T Bank Stadium in-venue execution was once again recognized with an industry award, capturing a 2021 Silver &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tellyawards?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@tellyawards&lt;/a&gt; in the "Immersive &amp;amp; Mixed Reality" category. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RavensFlock?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RavensFlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4CoS8UXsQ1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4CoS8UXsQ1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Famous Group (@FamousGroupLA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FamousGroupLA/status/1403368405965565957?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div id="USVh0a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperBowl?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuperBowl&lt;/a&gt; Sunday, so we're flashing back to our 7 minute, multi-cam &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MixedReality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MixedReality&lt;/a&gt; production that aired LIVE on the Fox broadcast minutes before last year's kick-off. We partnered with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NFL&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOXSports?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FOXSports&lt;/a&gt; to create a unique celebration of the greatest players in history! &lt;a href="https://t.co/17Qpgx59OC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/17Qpgx59OC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Famous Group (@FamousGroupLA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FamousGroupLA/status/1358520468039323649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Gh8pG"&gt;While we’ve been hearing about the promises of augmented reality and mixed reality for a long time — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21077484/apple-tim-cook-ar-augmented-reality"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook has been singing its praises for years&lt;/a&gt; — it has eluded massive mainstream adoption. And The Famous Group isn’t the only company to create giant AR spectacles; Riot Games has pulled off its own dazzling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;mixed reality showcases&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; events, such as bringing a giant dragon to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq39f4x_lmU"&gt;opening ceremonies of the Worlds 2017 final&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bPRekO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tq39f4x_lmU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIMLjy"&gt;Personally, I’m hoping the tech means that we’ll see AR &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F77179265&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F15%2F22672199%2Fcarolina-panthers-mixed-augmented-reality-viral-virtual-mascot" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;kaiju mascot battles&lt;/a&gt; someday.&lt;/p&gt;
