    <title>Fry’s Electronics is shutting its doors for good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LN3T54U3JzNKk2yJ3JNzyuZ8cfU=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866122/20190209_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c2c6gs"&gt;Fry’s Electronics, one of the last big brick-and-mortar electronics store chains in the United States — and a Silicon Valley institution in particular — is permanently closing nationwide, &lt;a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/national/frys-electronics-permanently-closes-nationwide/"&gt;local broadcaster KRON4 has confirmed&lt;/a&gt;, following a report &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bill0004/status/1364407906192424964"&gt;from Bill Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewKeysLive/status/1364424681302810630"&gt;another from Matthew Keys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3EFUE"&gt;The company’s Facebook page is also gone and its Twitter feed has been set to private — it was public earlier this evening, though it hadn’t tweeted in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye3JiM"&gt;If you’ve ever visited a Fry’s anytime in the past two to three years, none of this will come as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmKxWG"&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry%27s_Electronics"&gt;the family-owned business&lt;/a&gt; had been pushed to the brink of extinction by online retailers like Amazon, Newegg and more. Initially, the company started a campaign to price-match any item you could find online. It added a children’s toy aisle, huge racks of As Seen on TV gadgets, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/637759447381639168"&gt;even perfume&lt;/a&gt;. But things got worse. By 2019, what used to be a paradise of gadgets, computers, components, video games, audio equipment and appliances had turned into ghost warehouses &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1229277395695235072"&gt;filled with empty shelves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iTPbAD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Horn of Plenty is barren. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ycE0EBLHpD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ycE0EBLHpD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Harry McCracken (@harrymccracken) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1229277395695235072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GVPN1s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Is-Fry-s-Electronics-in-trouble-Company-denies-14945559.php"&gt;It turned out&lt;/a&gt; the company had been forced to switch to a consignment model, only able to attract suppliers willing to get paid for their goods &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; Fry’s managed to sell them. Many suppliers weren’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwkzN4"&gt;YouTuber star Bitwit famously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq2rUsUTL_0"&gt;conducted a video investigation&lt;/a&gt; that showed the depths the once-great stores had sunk to — and how the company shipped extra inventory to its Las Vegas store just in case journalists stopped by during CES 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rS4qvz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wq2rUsUTL_0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVxNNd"&gt;Soon, the company began closing its stores — and not just any stores, but major ones in the heart of Silicon Valley, like &lt;a href="https://laughingsquid.com/frys-palo-alto-the-western-theme/"&gt;its cowboy-themed store in Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt; mere steps away from where my dad used to work on the Danger Hiptop (known better as the T-Mobile Sidekick) and many big tech startups still do business. That Palo Alto store closed &lt;a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2019/12/27/the-era-of-frys-electronics-comes-to-an-end-in-palo-alto"&gt;in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I used to ride my bike to the company’s Egyptian-themed, pyramid shaped store in Campbell, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Fry-s-Electronics-closes-Campbell-store-15719689.php"&gt;which abruptly closed last November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2GcvC"&gt;Egyptians? Cowboys? Yes, setting foot into a Fry’s Electronics was an Experience with a capitol “E” — when I moved to the Bay Area in 1990, one of the very first stores was laid out like the insides of a (now-vintage) computer — you’d walk down the aisles of the motherboard, bumping into giant human-sized capacitors and resistors as you’d go. The Egyptian store had fake columns, mummies and sarcopaghi; laptops were laid out on huge stone slabs held up by statues of black panthers. That Palo Alto store which closed? Fake horses and hot air balloons hanging from the ceiling. Here are a few of the other locations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Zapoe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fry's Electronics @ Burbank, CA (opened 1995) &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kj5yqorQ7K"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kj5yqorQ7K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Froyo Tam   #BlackLivesMatter (@FroyoTam) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FroyoTam/status/1364432478807617538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Df4ZI"&gt;“Going to a Fry’s store is entertainment in itself; for a geek, it could be recuperative,” wrote former Apple exec Jean-Louis Gassée &lt;a href="https://mondaynote.com/the-frys-era-8709a7e602eb"&gt;in a 2019 blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I wholeheartedly agree — I’d even occasionally grab some food, either a packet of discount astronaut ice cream or one of the many, many selections from their tremendous candy shelves attached to the checkout line. They’d even do cheap hot dogs and soda in the parking lot, some summers when I was growing up. The company’s Black Friday doorbusters were a Silicon Valley event, too, with lines around the block for $200 laptops and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/8317301136818176"&gt;$60 routers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8rbsj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The most magical place in the universe:&lt;br&gt;The Fry’s store in Campbell. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gUGHYGN5Do"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gUGHYGN5Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SwiftOnSecurity (@SwiftOnSecurity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/931956226379960320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17THmh"&gt;There was the little matter of Fry’s famously bad customer service, though. Rare was the day I’d find an employee who knew anything about their products, checkout lines were long, returns were incredibly slow, and the company was well-known for taking product returns, slapping on a discount label, and sticking them right back on the shelf. They’d also try to check every item against your receipt as you left, something that (unlike Costco, where you sign a member’s agreement) you didn’t need to let them do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knfkVB"&gt;(I can’t figure out where to fit it, but there was also the amusing incident where a Ferrari-driving VP &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/frys-electronics-executive-accused-of-embezzling-65-million/"&gt;was found to have embezzled $65 million&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGKza1"&gt;The writing has been on the wall for Fry’s since last April, I would say, when reports surfaced &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/15/huge-tech-campus-eyed-in-north-san-jose-at-frys-electronics-site/"&gt;that its San Jose store might be replaced with an office campus&lt;/a&gt; — reports that often neglected to mention that Fry’s &lt;em&gt;corporate headquarters&lt;/em&gt; also occupied the same address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DzWOWW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uw0--6qFYo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prTiB4"&gt;For a lot of readers, I bet this news is more of a nostalgia trigger than a real loss. But for me, it feels like we’re at the end of the era of gadget stores, now that the one I grew up with is gone. Over the years, we’ve lost Radio Shack, Toys R Us, The Sharper Image and Brookstone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21067715/bose-shutting-down-retail-stores-layoffs-north-america-europe-japan-australia"&gt;the Bose stores&lt;/a&gt;, Circuit City, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21297400/microsoft-retail-stores-closing-cities-open"&gt;the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; and more. In the Silicon Valley we also lost CompUSA and Micro Center, and stores like Halted (known for actual circuits, not computers) and WeirdStuff Warehouse &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO5Db-F00CSBDxu9b2YdXLFquuFibQ8Iqqqs-064iNYbn0jR1hW5iLmv80a4i91Hg?key=ZnBnMHIxNGZIeVd3QkxXMzJ5TVd6bjI3Rk1sX0hn"&gt;(a wild experience itself&lt;/a&gt;!) have long since closed their doors as well. Some of the bigger ones have become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/19/21578231/radioshack-rev-relaunch-online-store-zombie-brand"&gt;zombie brands&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re effectively gone. (Micro Center still has stores outside the Bay Area.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtWh4d"&gt;I’m trying to think of any Silicon Valley electronics stores left, save Central Computer and of course Apple and Best Buy. If you think of any, let me know in the comments below? I might like to visit while that’s still an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck4o76"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Oculus Quest feature lets you mark your actual couch in VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dgc1PWO0MlqOoiAhSBm9xp-qGaM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866064/akrales_200904_4160_0208.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bg5she"&gt;A new Oculus Quest feature expands the headset’s Guardian mode by letting you mark your real couch as an object that’ll show up in VR. The Guardian is an Oculus safety feature that lets you draw lines around your environment that act as a virtual boundary and appear in VR when you get too close to the edges; this couch mode is the first time that the Guardian has worked as more than just a simple measure of floor space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="170JVg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-couch-guardian/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that you can mark out your couch or chair by touching one side and dragging out a virtual blue rectangle across it to define the correct size. Once you’ve done that it’ll appear as a 3D-modeled couch in the Oculus Home menu environment, or as the same blue rectangle when using the Guardian feature in an app or a game, and its position will be saved as part of the Guardian system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cdotPd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"},{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8C5lai"&gt;What makes this cool is that the couch can now act as an extension of your Guardian system rather than as an obstacle that limits your space. Previously you’d have had to draw Guardian boundaries in front of your couch as if the space above it was a solid wall, so as not to accidentally walk into it. But now if you move to the edges of the Guardian and see the couch outside it, &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reports, you can simply sit down on it and get prompted to switch to “Couch mode,” so the game or app will know you’re sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2EQIQ"&gt;The feature is still early, though — it’s listed as “experimental” in the Quest settings menu as part of software version 26 and hasn’t yet rolled out to everyone, including us. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG will license its webOS software to other TV brands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oyc_CowuZJ91vN3WNAds3RY4YkQ=/239x0:3239x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68865091/Powered_by_webOS_TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5s8mw3"&gt;LG tonight announced that the company’s webOS smart TV platform will soon be found on TVs from other brands. RCA, Ayonz, and Konka are some of the companies that have already signed on. “This has the potential to reshape the TV business for both technology and content providers while significantly growing LG’s presence and prominence in the global home entertainment market,” LG said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16BZXX"&gt;The news comes after LG revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;a significantly overhauled version of webOS&lt;/a&gt; at CES in January. On LG’s 2021 TVs, the slide-up “blades” interface has been ditched entirely in favor of a more traditional scrolling home screen. I’ve seen a wide range in opinions from LG’s existing TV customers; some like the new look since it resembles a streaming device and seems easier to use. Others who’ve come to appreciate the more colorful and “fun” webOS hope LG will keep webOS 6 off their TVs from 2020 and earlier. I’ll need some more time with the software before I can weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDoP0N"&gt;But that redesign isn’t something that buyers of licensed webOS TVs will have to think about — at least not yet. LG tells me that the “powered by webOS TV” platform is based on webOS 5.0. So it’ll look just the same as LG TVs from the last several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgZip"&gt;In licensing its platform to other TV brands, LG is following in the footsteps of Roku and Amazon, each of which has joined with third parties to release Roku TVs and Fire TV Edition TVs, respectively. Here’s what LG says its partners will get out of the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P6RMyS"&gt;Licensees of webOS TV receive the familiar and highly acclaimed UX design along with a rich pool of features such as voice search and control, integrated AI algorithms, and easy connectivity that have earned webOS positive industry and consumer accolades. With LG webOS TV, partners also get a diversity of content options including access to global streaming service apps such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and sports streaming service DAZN as well as LG Channels, the company’s free premium content streaming service. Compatible TV models also include the dedicated Magic Motion remote controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NRW1dr7yHEVrobWLiM08L8XHpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324250/webOS_TV_Partners.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG has already lined up a number of partners for “powered by webOS” TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lhsvT2"&gt;What’s in it for LG? The company will have control over the TV software experience across more devices — and also take in more advertising revenue. Expanding webOS to more TVs will get the ad-sponsored LG Channels in front of new eyes. This approach also gives LG more user data to make improvements to webOS, which will in turn benefit the company’s own TV lineup. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California can finally enforce its landmark net neutrality law, judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPWnjZRUBCIuw4Ywj5gtgMnv3Po=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864908/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VtbpaX"&gt;Net neutrality &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;died a horrible death&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, but things have just turned around: California’s landmark net neutrality law — erected in 2018 but immediately blocked by lawsuits from Trump’s Department of Justice and the telecom industry — can finally be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH8xmV"&gt;That’s the verdict from Judge John Mendez today, who declined to grant the telecom industry the preliminary injunction it had requested. The case might not be over, but the law can go into effect — and the judge doesn’t think the telecom industry is likely to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cS8w0Y"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories/status/1364363591822962691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364363591822962691%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLEx &lt;/em&gt;journalist Mike Swift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1364363126934802433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364363126934802433%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;’s Eriq Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, each of whom had been following the decision live, Judge Mendez believes it should be up to Congress to say whether net neutrality should exist: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2CUceS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Mendez says it should be up to Congress, not federal courts, to regulate &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NetNeutrality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NetNeutrality&lt;/a&gt; "When you have to deal with legislation drafted in 1934 in 2021, I don’t think anyone is well served ...That is Congress' job. They have to keep up with what is going on in the real world." &lt;a href="https://t.co/4yceR9bbT4"&gt;https://t.co/4yceR9bbT4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Swift (@Swiftstories) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories/status/1364363591822962691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UJatyR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Judge addresses what he says is "elephant" in case: "There are political overtones... This decision today is a legal decision and shouldn’t be viewed in political lens. I'm not expressing anything on soundness of policy. That's better left to Congress."&lt;/p&gt;— Eriq Gardner (@eriqgardner) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1364363126934802433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="Qilicz"&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;acting chairwoman of the FCC&lt;/a&gt;’s thoughts on the matter: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pznARd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When the FCC, over my objection, rolled back its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/netneutrality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#netneutrality&lt;/a&gt; policies, states like California sought to fill the void with their own laws. Tonight a court in California decided that the state law can go into effect. This is big news for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openinternet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#openinternet&lt;/a&gt; policy.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1364369582325121028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0vfF0s"&gt;California State Senator Scott Weiner, who authored the bill, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364856200073219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364364856200073219%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;is celebrating&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2p1SwA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SB 822 is the strongest net neutrality law in the nation. We worked incredibly hard to pass this law, overcoming massive corporate opposition. California can now fully protect an open internet.&lt;/p&gt;— Senator Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364856200073219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWwfFI"&gt;And so am I, as a California resident who knows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;it’s past time to fix the internet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvGSJB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB822"&gt;Here’s the full text&lt;/a&gt; of the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018, also known as SB-822. It contains a list of things that ISPs are not going to be able to do, including paid prioritization, “zero-rating” favorable content so it doesn’t count against your data cap (think of those bundled streaming services!), and failing to tell you fast service actually is and how their network management practices and speeds actually work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop’s CFO has resigned because of course he did</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDe169"&gt;GameStop CFO Jim Bell &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/23/2180940/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Resignation-of-CFO-and-Succession-Plan-to-Support-Transformation.html"&gt;has resigned&lt;/a&gt;, and will be leaving the video game retailer for good on March 26th. That’s just over a month from now. GameStop also announced a “succession plan,” just in case it can’t immediately find anyone suitable to accelerate a mall-based video game retailer’s transformation into the post-pandemic future. We can only speculate on the reasons for his departure, but &lt;em&gt;let’s just come out and say what everyone is thinking: &lt;/em&gt;STONKS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fj0qqi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What did we learn from the GameStop mess?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22278890/jon-fortt-cnbc-anchor-interview-gamestop-stock-wallstreetbets-reddit"},{"title":"Robinhood, Reddit, Melvin Capital and u/DeepFuckingValue get questioned by Congress","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290110/house-financial-services-robinhood-gamestop-squeeze-roaringkitty-hearing"},{"title":"Reddit’s lead GameStop hypebeast is being sued for his role in the stock surge","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287612/reddit-wallstreetbets-gamestop-lawsuit-roaring-kitty-gill-market-manipulation"},{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"},{"title":"Please GameStop it, Hollywood","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cgovy2"&gt;It’s not like he had a falling-out with the company: “Mr. Bell’s resignation was not because of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices, including accounting principles and practices,” writes GameStop in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638021000024/gme-20210223.htm"&gt;this SEC filing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvC0jw"&gt;What I want to know: did &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oI_8YG6Vs"&gt;the Tendieman&lt;/a&gt; come for Bell? If not, perhaps he can still get a producer credit on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;the umpteen GameStock films&lt;/a&gt;, or a nice book deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley is now a cooperative board game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQuTEoQc3_oukXHOEp5XRYaIn-E=/45x0:1395x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864499/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_2.30.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QfEfbY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; has been adapted into board game form and is available to purchase now for $55, according to the game’s developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1364322680804057090"&gt;Eric Barone (ConcernedApe)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; got its start as a popular, indie-take on farm sim classic &lt;em&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/em&gt;, but now the video game will finally exist in physical form (without the need to go out and actually learn how to farm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXMB4V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; was developed over two years by Barone and board game designer Cole Meideros. The game aims to adapt the gameplay from the video game like farming, foraging, mining, and romance, into a customizable, but less open-ended form that you can actually finish in one sitting. The game is also designed for one to four players, meaning that just like the original game, you can play alone if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LLHint"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/31Sz4vMWYes?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQiJIV"&gt;Finishing the game requires completing “Grandpa’s Goals” and the Community Center bundles that you might already be familiar with from the video game version. Players complete tasks and collect resources by taking turns positioning their pawns around the board and engaging in an activity of their choice. Mining at the mines, fishing at the beach foraging in the wilderness, and of course, farming at the farm. The seasons advance one week at a time each round, meaning time and available resources change as the seasons do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rstE3A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-the-board-game-available-now/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the board game, Barone stresses that it was designed to feature some amount of depth and complexity. “It’s easy to play once you learn the rules, but it’s not a short, casual game.” he says. He also provided &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3x4p8nw2yr1a3j/Stardew%20Rules%20for%20Download.pdf?dl=0"&gt;the rulebook&lt;/a&gt; so you can get a better sense of how difficult it is to set up and how many other mechanics there are to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yp3px"&gt;While the board game doesn’t initially seem as approachable as the video game it’s based on, the amount of detail that went into recreating &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; in physical form seems really impressive. You can purchase &lt;a href="https://shop.stardewvalley.net/products/stardew-valley-the-board-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; now for $55&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original voice of Siri makes an appearance in Persona 5 Strikers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FELCDkDxuCkGK86h9BnooNh781Q=/284x0:2597x1542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864292/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_1.39.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: Solax Archive on YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njXIJQ"&gt;If you’ve spent the day playing through &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; and noticed the voice of the in-game digital assistant sounded familiar, it’s likely because it’s played by the original voice of Siri (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-strikers-got-siris-original-voice-actor-to-pl-1846337639"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Susan Bennett originally provided the voice for Apple’s digital assistant, and now she’s playing EMMA, the in-game AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJbVD0"&gt;You can hear what she sounds like in the role in the video below, around the 9:44 mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SbndlB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMEEm1JD5PY?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=577&amp;amp;start=577" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V9oBKz"&gt;If you ask your iPhone for directions to the nearest camping store, though, you may notice that its response doesn’t exactly sound like the game. That’s because, while Bennett was the original voice for Siri when it debuted with the iPhone 4S running iOS 5 (though technically Siri existed with Bennett’s voice before it was ever added to the iPhone), &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/04/tech/mobile/bennett-siri-iphone-voice"&gt;she was replaced with the launch of iOS 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWtQRc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.typeform.com/blog/human-experience/siri-is-dying-long-live-susan-bennett/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typeform&lt;/em&gt; has an interview with Bennett&lt;/a&gt; about how she became the voice of Siri, and it includes tons of voice recordings from her, which you can compare to her work in &lt;em&gt;Strikers&lt;/em&gt;. You can also watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIn5DZU_NoA"&gt;Apple’s ad that introduces Siri on the iPhone 4S&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for what Siri sounded like back then in case its current iteration has overwritten those memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IVpFcp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Check out Siri Susan as Emma on the new P5Strikers game!  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/P5Strikers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#P5Strikers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emma?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Emma&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GamingNews?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GamingNews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8QuoIBdav9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8QuoIBdav9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Susan Bennett (@SiriouslySusan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SiriouslySusan/status/1363211830877949954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52dK8d"&gt;This is the kind of extra mile we love to see game developers go. “We need someone to play the voice assistant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/resolutionroute/status/1363937521995042817?s=20"&gt;in the English version of the game&lt;/a&gt;. How about the person who played one of the first major voice assistants?” If you want to experience it for yourself, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22153815/persona-5-strikers-release-date-switch-ps4-steam-north-america"&gt;is out today on PlayStation, Steam, and Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>USPS unveils next-generation mail truck with electric drivetrain option</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6M2BpES99bGf7SKxeHXTeico5w=/447x227:2560x1636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864219/suburb2_9_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Otto1P"&gt;The United States Postal Service (USPS) &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-postal-service-awards-contract-to-launch-multi-billion-dollar-modernization-of-postal-delivery-vehicle-fleet-301233896.html"&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt; its new mail truck after a years-long competition. The new truck will be built by Wisconsin-based defense contractor Oshkosh and can be fitted with both gasoline and electric drivetrains. But it won’t hit the road until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AazfM0"&gt;Oshkosh winning the contract is a potentially major blow to commercial electric vehicle startup Workhorse, which was one of the three remaining bidders. The company’s stock price plummeted following the announcement, and trading was halted multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjbnuN"&gt;The USPS has been looking to replace its existing mail trucks for years now, and it started taking solicitations for new designs back in 2015. The need for new trucks is urgent. The ones currently on the road are not only woefully out of date — they don’t even have air conditioning — but &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-postal-service-mail-trucks-hundreds-catching-fire-age-delivery-2020-7"&gt;they’re a major fire risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZFAgY"&gt;The switchover was supposed to start happening in 2018, but the program experienced multiple setbacks. The USPS repeatedly extended deadlines in the early going at the request of the bidding manufacturers, and then when they finally delivered the first prototypes, many of them were faulty, &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;according to an Inspector-General report released last August&lt;/a&gt;. The program was hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;further delays once the COVID-19 pandemic hit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSbPnO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More cargo space, air conditioning, and hopefully fewer fires&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0dpdZU"&gt;The new truck has more cargo space, better ergonomics, and, yes, air conditioning. It’s also dotted with cameras that give a 360-degree view, helping power a front- and rear-collision avoidance system with visual and audio warnings as well as automatic braking. The big front windshield and low hood should also give drivers a much better view of the road and pedestrians or cyclists, which is a big improvement for the safety of people outside the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANIrLe"&gt;Oshkosh still has to finalize the design of the mail truck, which is part of the reason for the two-year wait. The defense contractor is getting a $482 million investment up front and is promising to make between 50,000 to 165,000 of the trucks over 10 years. Oshkosh had been working with Ford during the bidding process, but it’s unclear whether Ford was still involved in the final product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qWq6d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10358184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBBgP5"&gt;The USPS and Oshkosh don’t say exactly how many of the trucks will be gas-powered and how many will be electric, just that the plan is to make both and that the vehicles will be designed in a way so that the powertrains can be switched to electric over time. The USPS says the gas engines will be “fuel efficient low-emission” but did not specify what it means by those terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqvBDw"&gt;President Biden said in January that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;wants to replace the entire government fleet to electric drivetrains&lt;/a&gt;, though that won’t be possible without the USPS, which accounts for about a third of those vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYY0gs"&gt;“It’s disappointing that today’s announcement does not immediately commit to electrifying one of our nation’s largest vehicle fleets,” Robbie Diamond, the CEO of nonprofit Securing America’s Future Energy, said in a statement. “This contract is a golden opportunity to stimulate the domestic EV market and supply chain, and a commitment to electrifying the [postal fleet] would provide a clear incentive for further domestic EV industry development along the entire supply chain, from minerals to markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNcDd5"&gt;Workhorse was the last remaining bidder pitching a fully electric vehicle, and it put a lot of effort into surviving as a business just to make it to the end of this process. The company sold off a small drone division, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173309/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-interview-ceo-gm-ohio-factory-trump"&gt;ostensibly spun out a new startup in Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt; to make an electric pickup truck without Workhorse’s baggage, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259037/usps-coronavirus-pandemic-next-generation-mail-truck-program-delay"&gt;even paid $7 million to buy out its original partner in the bid&lt;/a&gt;, trucking manufacturer VT Hackney.

  &lt;p id="7XLyxW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s seventh episode&lt;/a&gt; started to answer some of the biggest questions of the series, and — in line with its sitcom trappings — the show dropped one of its biggest reveals yet in a &lt;em&gt;very spoiler-y&lt;/em&gt; retro-style theme song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enkdac"&gt;Since the episode was released, the track has exploded in popularity to the point that Disney seems to have noticed by dropping the official soundtrack on services like Spotify and Apple Music a few days ahead of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1364329004573016067"&gt;planned release&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, February 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMfCic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; episode 7 ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wgCsog"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WandaVision’s seventh episode answers two big questions but introduces many more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7dMZuy"&gt;That’s right, you can now stream the official version of “Agatha All Along” to your heart’s content. The song, like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s other sitcom themes, was written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez (best known for their work on the &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt; soundtracks) featured at the end of the most recent episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h327Ni"&gt;“Agatha All Along” reveals that nosy neighbor “Agnes” is in fact the witch Agatha Harkness — who, as the song makes clear in an incredibly catchy manner, was behind at least some of the oddities of Westview all along as the villain of the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uXB0vL"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; padding-top: 80px;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0kHsXoIt6dONEdkgKgyjoK" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LJRiM"&gt;Since the episode was released, the song has already become a TikTok trend, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lelandphilpot/status/1363286213390696455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;received a trap remix&lt;/a&gt;, and been re-created as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGS7TYmIZOQ"&gt;soaring orchestral number&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the kind of popularity that brings to mind another musical streaming hit: the massively viral “Toss A Coin To Your Witcher” from Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KHa3Dq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix blew the release for ‘Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,’ the hit song of the season","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="imnPBS"&gt;That song had similarly exploded in popularity across the internet when &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; was released, but it took Netflix over a month to get its act together and release an official version of the soundtrack on streaming services, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"&gt;almost entirely missing the moment&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a mistake that the streamer hasn’t made since, and the viral soundtracks to more recent shows — like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fus%2Falbum%2Fbridgerton-covers-from-the-netflix-original-series-ep%2F1544579825&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F23%2F22297497%2Fwandavision-spoiler-episode-7-soundtrack-song-disney-plus-spotify-apple-music" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;’s pop culture covers&lt;/a&gt; — have been available alongside the series’s debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPwTii"&gt;With the early release of the soundtrack, it seems that Disney has made a similar choice to ride the wave and not let “Agatha All Along” pass it by, even if it means bumping up a few release dates — until the next &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; theme song takes over TikTok, that is. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn is back up after an outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World Economy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zM6hGbIUlOVFBq2dN6Df6oigPOw=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68863105/1229893855.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gZ6ecW"&gt;LinkedIn is back up after a worldwide outage affecting users on both mobile and desktop. The Microsoft-owned social network first started experiencing issues around 2PM ET, and LinkedIn confirmed things were back to normal at 4:21PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djJPYL"&gt;The company didn’t give a specific reason for the outage, though did &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529"&gt;jokingly suggest&lt;/a&gt; the issues may have been due to a &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFhyA6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pardon the interruption everyone. We're back on track now. Unconfirmed reports indicate it might have been Agatha all along.  &lt;/p&gt;— LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1364324499383062529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="044dPn"&gt;It’s rare for LinkedIn to experience outages. LinkedIn last experienced widespread issues in January last year, when users weren’t able to post to the service or make new connections. Today’s outage affected the entire website, and it wasn’t loading for most users at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7Qc7R"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 23rd, 5:08PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: LinkedIn is back up, so we have updated the headline and article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
