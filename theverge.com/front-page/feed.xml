    <title>Asus Zenbook 14X OLED review: a cool but impractical laptop</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;You can get a better OLED notebook for less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6Jl0Tc"&gt;Zenbooks of this size are all usually a pretty similar deal — if you’ve used one, you’ve used them all. Two traits attempt to make the Zenbook 14X OLED, slated for release in early 2022, unique. The first is its OLED display, which is one of the first 90Hz OLED panels to appear in mass production. (Asus’s Vivobook Pro 14 OLED, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834763/asus-vivobook-pro-14-oled-2022-5900hx-review"&gt;I reviewed earlier&lt;/a&gt;, is another.) The second is that the touchpad is also a screen. Like, it’s literally a tiny touchscreen. You can put windows down there and navigate them as you would with any other touchscreen device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLo0Cb"&gt;A bit of a spoiler: both of these features are cool but not quite as cool as they sound, especially considering their impact on battery life. Ultimately, if the Zenbook is a package you’re interested in, you’re better off going for the Vivobook Pro 14 OLED, which has the same OLED screen with an eight-core processor and a better GPU for a couple hundred dollars cheaper. The Zenbook’s target audience is really folks who want something out of the ordinary and are willing to pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f29NMA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10944078"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="tObLnp"&gt;To start with the OLED screen — it’s neat. It’s 16:10, it’s 2880 x 1800, and it’s a step up in the visual experience from a standard 1920 x 1200 panel. Colors are vivid, and blacks, the trademark of OLED technology, are very, very black. It makes text just a bit more striking, which is fun for me as someone who reads and writes all day. It almost maxes out our colorimeter, covering 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, 99 percent of Adobe RGB, and 100 percent of P3, and reaching 395 nits of brightness. Some glare is visible in a bright office setting, but nothing that interferes with work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3OYMZ"&gt;The 90Hz refresh rate is quite nice — scrolling is noticeably smoother — but, again, I’m not sure it’s worth the battery life impact. (More on that in a bit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14X OLED on a wooden table angled to the left. The screen displays a multicolor background with the Asus Zenbook OLED logo.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty color scheme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJKvoh"&gt;Second, the touchscreen touchpad. This is a similar idea to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285164/asus-zenbook-duo-review-screenpad-plus-dual-screen-laptop-specs-freatures-price"&gt;Asus’s Zenbook Duo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review"&gt;Zephyrus Duo 15&lt;/a&gt;, and other various dual-screen laptops that the company’s tried. The touchpad essentially functions as a tiny external display — you can drag windows back and forth between it and the primary panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88WnRR"&gt;When you don’t have a window open on the touchpad and you’re not actually using it as a touchpad, it’s essentially a secondary desktop with a grid of apps and shortcuts. The most useful one, to me, is the Group button, which allows you to “capture” whatever group of tabs and apps you have open at the time and pull it back up later. You can pull up a number pad and a calculator (which you can also do on the Vivobook’s screenless touchpad, though it doesn’t look as cool). There are shortcuts to open Voice Recorder, Solitaire, and the like on the primary screen (and you can add your apps and webpages of choice). There’s a Handwriting app — scribble on it, and the words will appear as text wherever your cursor is (email, Slack message, whatever). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQ7VIM"&gt;This technology is very cool, and Asus has done a nice job making its interface attractive and easy to use. I’ll also admit that I still haven’t really found a use case for it. For a while, I tried sticking Slack or Twitter down there to glance at every so often while I worked. But neither was usable on such a tiny screen. This touchpad is the same size as many smartphones, but apps and webpages that you use on your smartphone are designed to be navigated on a tiny screen — apps on the Zenbook are not. Text was tiny, and clicking was clumsy (and I have small fingers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vL4zga"&gt;The Handwriting app is actually impressive, and the device interpreted my terrible handwriting perfectly. That said, you should understand that this is a text-recognition app, not a full note-taking app — you can’t draw pictures or diagrams and expect the Zenbook to reproduce them. (And it couldn’t recognize Chinese and Korean characters I wrote, at least not with my language set to English.) As a pure handwriting-recognition tool, it is fun, but it does seem mostly to be fun — I’m not sure who actually needs something like this for their job (and folks that do can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Drawing-Software-Included-CTL4100/dp/B079HL9YSF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fine Wacom tablets&lt;/a&gt; for under $100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MixkDf"&gt;As I noted earlier, the most compelling component for me of the touchscreen touchpad is the grouping feature, especially since the numpad and calculator functions are available in plenty of other Asus laptops. But I don’t think that’s worth a several hundred dollar premium over the Vivobook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e96exK"&gt;It also seemed to confuse my external display a bit — windows I brought over were often too big by default and needed to be resized manually. I’m guessing the Zenbook is considering the touchpad as an extension of the primary screen (rather than a secondary screen), and that’s somehow throwing off its sizing. Regardless, this isn’t a disaster, but it is something I hope Asus can figure out before this ships. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hdR_nIrBWsWBFZGRTTUaKrj79Xg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084848/akrales_211207_4816_0064.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the other portson the right (two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C, one HDMI 2.0, one microSD reader, one audio combo jack).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14X OLED touchpad, displaying the Screenpad homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/180TqsgJh-ccqqrIrIY0PijJUxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084845/akrales_211207_4816_0035.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold the ScreenPad, running ScreenXpert 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ogk4k7"&gt;Elsewhere, this is Zenbook through and through. It’s a fine-looking device with a nice lustrous lid that you can easily open with one hand and no screen wobble. A warning about Zenbooks, in general, is that the lids are fingerprint magnets — my unit was constantly smudged. The build is a bit plasticky — there’s a small amount of flex in the screen and keyboard, and I saw one small dent in the bottom of the deck after battering the device around in my full backpack for a few days — but a step above budget fodder. There’s a dark gray futuristic-y finish. It’s 0.67 inches (16.9 mm) thick and just over three pounds (1.4 kg) — not a featherweight but portable enough.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5frMed"&gt;Like many Asus laptops, this Zenbook has the Ergolift hinge — the lid folds beneath the deck and lifts the keyboard up a few degrees, conveniently hiding some of the bottom bezels. This is supposed to make typing more ergonomic and help with cooling, but it was also a bit sharp on my lap. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14X OLED webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bhhi2acfmHYCldbGHnmvtsubuZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084850/akrales_211207_4816_0079.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s an HD camera, and it’s very tiny.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ttmzu3"&gt;There are two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one HDMI 2.0, one microSD reader, and one audio jack. That’s a good mix, though I wish both USB-C ports weren’t on the right side. The Harmon Kardon speakers sound fine but don’t get nearly as much volume as I’d like — I sometimes had to lean far forward to hear my Zoom calls. The keyboard is comfortable with decent travel, and there’s a fingerprint sensor in the power button that didn’t give me any trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfuewe"&gt;One final thing to be aware of: the webcam isn’t good. Colors are accurate, but it’s grainy and a bit blurry at times — my editor said it looked like someone had smeared Vaseline over it during a Zoom call. I do enough video calls for work now that this would be a concern for me. I also appreciate physical shutters (which this one doesn’t have, though there’s a kill switch on the keyboard) the more I hear about embarrassing Zoom incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zenbook 14X OLED touchpad displaying the ScreenPad homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ATQ4aKTD67cQMOjxjNyzAWr-CA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084842/akrales_211207_4816_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hit that tiny button in the bottom left corner to turn the Screenpad back into a regular navigable touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SWSrZL"&gt;Inside is a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, in addition to an Nvidia GeForce MX450 discrete GPU. Samsung and Asus gave me a price of $1,400 for this unit but caveated that pricing may change closer to release. If that happens, I will update this review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S3bI2"&gt;These specs, to put it bluntly, confuse me. The MX450 is a very entry-level GPU that I wouldn’t even recommend for esports gaming. (Forget about hitting 90 frames per second in modern games with it.) 16GB of RAM (the most you can get in this device) will also not be enough for many professional workloads. I’m happy to see 1TB of storage at this price, but I still can’t see this being a good choice for professionals or for gamers — it still seems primarily slated to be a multimedia machine for people who like OLED screens and smooth scrolling. For those folks, a Zenbook 14x is e-waste — the Vivobook pairs the same screen with an RTX 3050 for (allegedly) $200 cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OHZlkK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These specs, to put it bluntly, confuse me&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hq2Zdt"&gt;That aside, the Zenbook did a fine job with my daily workload, even in the silent fan profile (called “Whisper Mode” in Asus’ control center) with Battery Saver on. It was sometimes warm but never hot, and I didn’t usually hear any fan noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWaj5A"&gt;But there’s a big tradeoff for that: battery life. I’m sure the Vivobook’s longevity isn’t helped by the fact that it’s operating a 90Hz high-resolution panel and &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;running a secondary screen. Still, this Zenbook doesn’t last long enough. I only averaged five hours and 38 minutes of continuous office use with this device around 200 nits of brightness. That does slightly beat the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s less than we’ve seen from all kinds of high-resolution devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22790175/huawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen"&gt;Huawei’s MateBook 16 &lt;/a&gt;or any of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s M1-equipped laptops&lt;/a&gt;. It means I couldn’t go a workday without plugging the device in. For most people (but especially those shopping for a 14-inch device), battery life is going to be more useful than an MX450 and a touchscreen touchpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CASrT"&gt;My final note is on bloatware. This device shipped with a big load of annoying software preinstalled, including several McAfee programs that insisted on scanning everything I downloaded before I could open it, and that required me to close all my Chrome tabs and restart the computer in order to be uninstalled. This stuff shouldn’t be on a laptop that costs $1,400 — it just shouldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14X OLED angled to the right on a wooden table, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ovVwlzk6plCY57bAErGhZZjBds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084847/akrales_211207_4816_0056.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Booo, bloatware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rpSBQs"&gt;The Zenbook 14X OLED is a fairly affordable way to pair a 90Hz OLED screen with a GPU. Despite various nitpicks I have, it works well enough as a driver. The problem is that another laptop exists — the Vivobook Pro 14 OLED, with a very similar chassis, a very similar screen, and a better GPU — at a significantly lower price. I’m actually wondering if Asus and Samsung got wires crossed here because it makes no sense that the Zenbook costs so much more, so I’ll be keeping an eye out for any changes as we approach the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EelwIP"&gt;The main thing that could potentially justify the Zenbook’s price premium is its fancy touchpad. I really do like that Asus is doing this touchpad. I like that there’s a company out there trying things like this that are new and different — and that those things actually work. I can’t tell you how refreshing it is, as someone whose job it is to test a million laptops a week that are all basically the same thing, to know that there’s a company out there trying to figure out where they can do things differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pQWLFS"&gt;I really, really hope there’s a group of people out there who has a perfect use for this touchpad in their life and who will turn out in droves to pay extra for this Zenbook because it’s the first laptop ever made that perfectly suits their needs. I’m not in this group, and I’m skeptical that it exists, but God, I hope it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lBQYqR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10944065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s AWS logs third outage this month, affecting Slack, Epic Games Store, Asana and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcfUAN03InB_0UTKa7CYDLIq97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305351/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuvhOy"&gt;Amazon’s crucial web services business AWS is experiencing problems today due to a power outage, affecting services like Slack, Imgur, and the Epic Games store for some users. It’s not looking good if you’re working from home, with some Slack users unable to view or upload images, and work management tool Asana also hit by the outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ6o2o"&gt;At 6:13AM PST, Amazon said it had &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22613821%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Ddash.parsely.com%5Bd%5DD"&gt;restored power&lt;/a&gt; to the affected servers, and by 9:28AM PST it had “restored underlying connectivity to the majority of the remaining” systems. However, users may still be experiencing issues as services and servers are relaunched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMi62F"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-12/a17eae991fdc437d"&gt;incident update&lt;/a&gt;, Slack said its services were “experiencing issues with file uploads, message editing, and other services.” Asana said the problems constituted a “&lt;a href="https://status.asana.com/incidents/xm08pc5v6mlk"&gt;major outage&lt;/a&gt;,” with “many of our users unable to access Asana.” Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1473644098632441860"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “Internet services outages” were “affecting logins, library, purchases, etc.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJBnzJ"&gt;It’s the third time in as many weeks that problems with AWS have had a significant effect on online services. Two incidents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837637/aws-west-is-down-twitch-outage-amazon"&gt;involving AWS&lt;/a&gt; ended up knocking out a huge array of platforms and products, taking out streaming sites like Netflix and Disney Plus as well as smart home devices like security cameras from Ring and Wyze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gT4U31"&gt;Today’s outages seem less widespread but still notable, with some users unable to access services entirely and others merely experiencing intermittent faults. &lt;a href="http://DownDetector.com"&gt;DownDetector.com&lt;/a&gt; shows reports of issues with the platforms mentioned above, as well as news aggregator Flipboard, online learning site Udemy, dating app Grindr, streaming service Hulu, and IoT services from Honeywell, Life360, and Samsung’s SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAowQB"&gt;The official &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS service health dashboard&lt;/a&gt; blamed the issues on power outages in a single data center, affecting one Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) within the US-EAST-1 Region. At 6:13AM PST, the company said it had restored power to the data center and was making progress recovering the affected instances. By 9:28AM PST the company said it had “restored underlying connectivity to the majority of the remaining EC2 instance and EBS volumes, but are now working through full recovery at the host level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6IIXH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Wednesday, December 22nd, 8:36AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story to add responses from affected services. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMzrY4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Wednesday, December 22nd, 9: 34AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story to note that AWS has restored power to the affected data center. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXYy5u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Wednesday, December 22nd, 12:41AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with latest from AWS. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hrWSqQ9_fcsQvWFv7xccRBzC6PU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306526/vpavic_201103_4275_0182.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8b03dj"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X keeps coming and going, but the next-gen console remains tricky to get a hold of. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22823914/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-restock-costco-availability"&gt;just saw it go up for sale at Costco&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and as usual, it did not last long before it sold out. Now, another chance has sprung up at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;Right now, you can queue up for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggdSQwET4b" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X from Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The retailer is just selling the console — no bundle required — and it is open to anyone, including those who are not Best Buy Totaltech subscribers. Just click the “Add to Cart” button and be patient while you are put in a digital line. As of right now, Best Buy appears to be releasing stock in waves, meaning you may have a second opportunity even if the console appears to be sold out.&lt;/p&gt;

Once you’ve added a console to your cart, you’ll be given about 10 minutes to complete your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8NlDK"&gt;These consoles may need to be a late Christmas gift at this point, but, hopefully, you may have some good fortune with a local, in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA authorizes first COVID-19 antiviral pill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Pdr2vK-iH9CeT9rK0tLkT57rWE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306483/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osVEYg"&gt;On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; the first antiviral pill to treat COVID-19, a move that gives doctors another tool to fight the disease. The treatment, made by Pfizer, curbs the risk of hospitalization and death in high-risk patients infected with the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9OPYf"&gt;Called Paxlovid, the treatment includes 30 pills taken at home over five days. It has to be started within a few days of symptoms — which could be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/health/covid-pill.html"&gt;a challenge&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, where it may be difficult for many people to get a COVID-19 test, a result, and see a doctor for a prescription in that window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAPtSm"&gt;Paxlovid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765110/pfizer-antiviral-hospitalization-death-covid"&gt;cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent&lt;/a&gt; for adults with COVID-19 at high risk of developing severe disease when it was given within three days of symptoms appearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kt3iSA"&gt;The FDA is also reviewing a second COVID-19 antiviral, called molnupiravir, which is made by pharmaceutical company Merck. That drug appears less effective than Paxlovid — a clinical trial found it only reduces the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/science/merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-covid-pill.html"&gt;by 30 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Le4AQO"&gt;Pills are cheaper and easier to use than monoclonal antibody therapies, which have been a major treatment used for people after they contract COVID-19. Those require an infusion. Pills also &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/pfizer-says-its-pill-may-be-effective-against-omicron-covid-19"&gt;may remain as effective&lt;/a&gt; against the omicron variant of the coronavirus as against other variants, like delta. The drugs target proteins that help the coronavirus make copies of itself — and the newly discovered variant does not have many mutations in that part of the virus. Most monoclonal antibodies appear &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/health/covid-monoclonal-antibodies-omicron.html"&gt;ineffective&lt;/a&gt; against the omicron variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzP97o"&gt;The Biden administration expects to have 250,000 courses of the Pfizer pills available by the end of January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/biden-team-plans-4-million-doses-of-covid-treatments-in-january?srnd=premium&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSpatc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XW09l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reinstates mask mandate for warehouse employees as omicron threat looms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/43aeKCufiOjP6h4BZILaT8whMQU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306267/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQH9r0"&gt;Amazon’s warehouse employees across the US will once again have to wear masks, according to an internal notice obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/22/amazon-revives-mask-mandate-for-warehouse-workers-amid-omicron-threat.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company reinstated its mask mandate as the omicron variant continues to spread during Amazon’s busiest time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SwnFiN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has been changing its stance on mask mandates throughout the year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1F5Upo"&gt;In the message sent to employees, Amazon said that all warehouse workers must wear masks, regardless of vaccination status or local mask requirements. “Your health and safety are of the utmost importance to us,” the notice read. “In response to the rapid spread of the Covid-19 omicron variant in the US and guidance from public health authorities and our own medical experts, face coverings are again required for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KthCvd"&gt;Amazon has been changing its stance on mask mandates throughout the year. The company initially &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/amazon-says-vaccinated-workers-can-ditch-masks-starting-next-week.html"&gt;stopped requiring facial coverings in May&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613542/amazon-warehouse-mask-mandate"&gt;revived the mask mandate in August&lt;/a&gt;. It briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757927/amazon-lifts-mask-mandates-vaccinated-warehouse-employees"&gt;lifted its mask mandate in November&lt;/a&gt; before reinstating it again starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyLxiu"&gt;Companies in the tech industry have been taking very different approaches to COVID-19 safety requirements. While Amazon hasn’t said it will require employees to get vaccinated, Intel and Google have taken things a bit further. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849074/intel-unvaccinated-employees-unpaid-leave"&gt;Unvaccinated employees at Intel could eventually face unpaid leave&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;those still unvaccinated at Google&lt;/a&gt; may be put on leave or even fired next year. Just like Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;Apple also isn’t requiring employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; and has instead asked unvaccinated employees to take tests more frequently — recently, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;number of stores&lt;/a&gt; due to COVID-19 outbreaks among employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUEGXz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Amazon with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla investigated over reports drivers can play its video games while vehicles are moving</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The NHTSA is investigating Tesla vehicles that allow games on their touchscreens | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fAOanM"&gt;The US government says it is investigating more than half a million Tesla vehicles sold since 2017, following reports that drivers can play video games available on its main display screen while driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxRudB"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says it received a complaint in August that said live games and internet web searching — which were supposedly restricted to passenger use only while the car was in motion — could be played by anyone in the vehicle at any time. Its Office of Defects and Investigations &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120234/INOA_PE21023_9605.PDF"&gt;said in a report&lt;/a&gt; that it “confirmed that this capability has been available since December 2020 in Tesla ‘Passenger Play’-equipped vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCAVaY"&gt;ODI’s preliminary evaluation will include an estimated 580,000 Tesla Model 3, Model S, and Model X vehicles sold between model years 2017 and 2022 “based on reports that Tesla gameplay functionality, which is visible on the front center touchscreen from the driver’s seat, is enabled even when the vehicle is being driven. This functionality, referred to as ‘Passenger Play,’ may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash,” according to the ODI report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6cJ1iJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported earlier this month that Tesla updated the playable video games in most of its vehicles in an over-the-air software update this summer. The update allowed some of the games to be played on center touch screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823127/tesla-car-arcade-games-safety-nhtsa"&gt;while the vehicles are in motion&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the update, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;Tesla Arcade games&lt;/a&gt; could only be played while a vehicle was parked. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;confirmed that a notification pops up when the games launch, and a user has to tap an “I am a passenger” confirmation button before playing. There’s little to prevent a driver from tapping the button and playing the games, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tVFUUC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla Arcade hands-on: using a Model 3 steering wheel as a game controller","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vGeAZ6"&gt;“Why is a manufacturer allowed to create an inherently distracting live video which takes over 2/3 of the screen which the driver relies on for all vehicle information?” the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120243/NHTSA_Safety_Issues.pdf"&gt;complainant asked&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJxKd8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Tesla for comment on the investigation, but after &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/10/06/tesla-dissolves-pr-department/"&gt;dissolving&lt;/a&gt; its press office in 2020, the company rarely replies to media inquiries. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doctor Strange 2’s first trailer goes mad for multiverses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZ_Mzu5Xu76r6glm5msw7D0PpQw=/459x0:1932x982/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306111/Screen_Shot_2021_12_22_at_11.10.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNGEOn"&gt;Marvel’s journey into the multiverse is barreling forward with the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, a sequel to 2016’s &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fmovies%2Fmarvel-studios-doctor-strange%2F4GgMJ1aHKHA2&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDoctorStrange122221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and what promises to be the MCU’s biggest foray yet into the alternate worlds and timelines that installments like &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; have begun to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1RhYEG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spider-Man: No Way Home swings big on two decades of fan payoff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834061/spider-man-no-way-home-review-tom-holland-marvel-multiverse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IieYm3"&gt;It seems that &lt;em&gt;Multiverse of Madness &lt;/em&gt;will be picking up on a breathtaking number of extant story threads in the MCU. It’s a follow-up to Doctor Strange’s (Benedict Cumberbatch) most recent appearance in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834061/spider-man-no-way-home-review-tom-holland-marvel-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where he helped Peter Parker do some &lt;em&gt;mild&lt;/em&gt; tampering with the fabric of reality. It’ll pick up on the revelations around Wanda Maximoff / The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) from &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fseries%2Fwandavision%2F4SrN28ZjDLwH&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDoctorStrange122221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Baron Mordo’s quest to cut down on the number of sorcerers meddling with magic from &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;’s post-credit sequence is back in play, as is what appears to be a darker version of Strange himself that previously appeared in the animated &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fseries%2Fwhat-if%2F7672ZVj1ZxU9&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDoctorStrange122221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If...?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F%3Fcid%3DDSS-Search-Google-71700000058993695-%26irclickid%3DVcGXSAwD-xyIW6CSdOVeVx8AUkGwtdwelxjQR00%26irgwc%3D1%26cid%3DDSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-Vox%2520Media-564546%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3dBoDWJXrDVwzeR5APtVTarczQ4WhI6tkPIVtKwBlFRLhxMopaTyLMaAlj9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDoctorStrange122221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Disney Plus. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XcVmuD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s tons of MCU tie ins here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMqDUw"&gt;That’s all in addition to everything new in the trailer, including more of the mind-bending landscapes that made the original Doctor Strange so visually arresting and characters like America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) and a giant eyeball monster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WADIGa"&gt;The trailer originally was released as the final post-credit scene for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; earlier in December, but Marvel has now put it online for everyone to see (pro-tip: this now also means that you don’t have to stick around for the entire credits if you see No Way Home over the next few weeks.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzlam7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on May 6.&lt;/p&gt;

While we have been tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22840189/christmas-gifts-best-last-minute-tech-gaming-gadgets-shipping"&gt;some gift ideas this week that still arrive in time&lt;/a&gt;, today, let’s bear down on a bunch of excellent sales — some on frequently discounted products that hit new low prices and others on newly launched gadgets to cut you early adopters a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fB7bA"&gt;Leading us off, it just isn’t the holiday season without a great Apple Watch deal — and in such a festive color. The green Apple Watch Series 7 may appear darker in person than in some photographs, but right now, it’s the cheapest way to get the latest smartwatch from Apple. You can pick up the base 41mm GPS model in green with a matching sport band for $339 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggaILWHuLd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a savings of $60 and the lowest price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll8DMm"&gt;Apple’s latest watch offers a larger display that stretches further out to the edges, and it’s more rugged than ever with IP6X dust resistance. This deal drops the price another $10 below the previous best discount we’ve seen, and if you make your move quick enough, it should arrive in time for Christmas from either retailer. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Bnwmo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4cOOjg"&gt;Turning from the world of smartwatches to the world of smart... lamps? No, it’s a speaker? Wait, do they know what it actually looks like? (They make smart versions of that as well, don’t they...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEbQYW"&gt;OK! Jokes aside, Sony’s new LSP-X3 combination lamp speaker may look like a fancy bong, but it’s actually a connected gadget that can help set the mood with light and audio. This portable Bluetooth speaker is all about vibes, as the glass-encased candlelight-style LED can mimic the flicker effect of an actual candle while you relax to your tunes (perhaps &lt;em&gt;The Grateful Dead&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Phish&lt;/em&gt;?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSVTp3"&gt;The Sony LSP-X3 was just released, but it is already discounted to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Directional-Candle-Like-Illumination-Bluetooth/dp/B09984VQCS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$248 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgga4qRyTs0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$249.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $100 off its sticker price. It still arrives in time for Christmas, so you can gift it to a loved one and record their confused reaction when they open it and wonder just what kind of stuff you think they’re into. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834645/sony-glass-sound-speaker-lspxs3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iieR33"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10943883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WOkOHK"&gt;Staying within Sony’s world of audio devices for a moment, though getting back to much more conventional designs, the new Sony WF-C500 wireless earbuds are another new product that can be picked up for early discounts. We gave this one a quick mention yesterday while it was part of Amazon’s deal of the day and priced at just $58, but if you missed out, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-resistance/dp/B09CFP6J6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can still pick it up today for $68&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8cfVz"&gt;Normally priced at $100, these earbuds offer a great value proposition for great sound and 10 hours of continuous battery life during playback. This deal ships after Christmas, but you may be hard-pressed to find this quality at the price. Remember, late Christmas gift rhymes with great Christmas gift. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828293/sony-wf-c500-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5wkWee"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10943913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E69TUc"&gt;For the Samsung fans in the audience, the flagship Galaxy Buds Pro are a well-established set of quality earbuds that feature active noise cancellation and a great balance of sound quality and comfort. They tick all the boxes that some models leave out, like good quality audio during phone calls, thanks to their triple microphone array with beamforming. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggbBfLseZD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggbBOtPTYt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Resistant/dp/B08MWY75DH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are selling the Galaxy Buds Pro for just $129.99 in violet, silver, and black colorways — a discount of $70 that matches their all-time low price. Each retailer indicates that these discounted buds should still arrive in time for Christmas. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kzTKzb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naw7Vt"&gt;The holidays offer a great time to catch up on the year’s back catalog of excellent video game titles, and if you’re an Xbox or PC player in need of extra controllers for some local multiplayer, then you’re currently in luck. Amazon has discounts on the standard Xbox Series X / S controllers in some vibrant colors, including the tennis ball green &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B08ZNQN1FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;electric volt&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B0859XT328?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pulse red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B08DFB488B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shock blue&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these is about $50 at checkout, discounted from their usual prices of $64.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPqOpx"&gt;While the standard Xbox controller is a quality gamepad, if you prefer something even more premium, you can opt for the Xbox Elite Series 2. This customizable, pro-level controller is currently on sale for its best price of $139.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggbTBFk9l4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522%3Fathbdg%3DL1200%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkGwtm0F1ykOzY0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkGwtm0F1ykOzY0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal122221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($40 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6uHRa2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10943980"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wcAGhT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YmIsJR"&gt;Changing gears from gaming to Google, if you haven’t bought into a smart home system, it may feel challenging to consider where to begin. If you’re partial to the Google Assistant, the current deal from Lowe’s on the Google Nest Mini (second-gen) with a GE smart plug adapter may be one of the easiest ways to get your toe in the water. The bundle normally runs $59.99, but you can get it from &lt;a href="https://lowes.sjv.io/c/482924/897039/12374?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd%2FGoogle-Nest-Mini-2nd-Gen-Google-Assistant-in-Chalk-Smart-Plug-Bundle%2F1003163360&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals102621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lowe’s for $24.99&lt;/a&gt; until the new year. It will not ship in time for Christmas, but you might be able to find it available for store pickup at a Lowe’s near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JF15ZR"&gt;This can make an excellent gift for a family member who just wants to be able to say, “Hey Google, turn off the light,” with a traditional light source, or you can plant it at your in-laws’ house (with their permission) to easily reset their router when they call you about internet trouble. The Nest Mini (second-gen) is also a solid little speaker for listening to music, so this bundle is very versatile for just $25. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wVr3Li"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828312"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BdZQGZ"&gt;More deals to go with your egg nog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1b4VwD"&gt;The second-generation Apple Pencil — the one that charges in a logical way via magnets — is back down to its best price ever of $99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($30 off). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U1Bbsf"&gt;Prefer to save a bit more money and don’t mind a Lightning-connector charging method that’s, let’s say, quirky? The original Apple Pencil is $79.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MK0C2AM-A-Apple-Pencil/dp/B016NY7784?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off). Not its best price ever, but just $10 above it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yw5BB5"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/a7a41a84?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_epicd_gd_dcl_img_10_a7a41a84_dt_sl5_46" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has Ring Alarm (second-gen) kits up to 38 percent off, including a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Alarm-5-piece-kit/dp/B07ZDTXJ93?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;five-piece kit&lt;/a&gt; perfect for a condo or apartment for $139.99 ($60 off). If you own a home and want to go all out with an included Echo Show 5 (second-gen) and Ring Video Doorbell (2020), it’s $274.98 for an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Alarm-8-Piece-Doorbell-Release/dp/B08YT3FBBW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight-piece kit&lt;/a&gt; ($150 off). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Zillow adds support for iOS 15’s SharePlay, so you can look at homes together from your studio apartments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02gu41lKchaj0mJQdxMrRrm9iEE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306018/FINAL_Zillow_SharePlay_Screenshot_1920x1080_122121.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxnJFo"&gt;Have you ever wanted to aimlessly scroll through Zillow and admire all the heinously expensive houses that you’ll never be able to afford thanks to the skyrocketing price of real estate — but also share that experience with a friend or loved one who isn’t able to join you in your &lt;s&gt;delusional&lt;/s&gt; aspirational browsing in real life? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ab3f31"&gt;Well, Zillow has debuted the solution to that dubiously common problem by adding support for Apple’s new SharePlay feature to its iPhone and iPad apps. Which, in turn, allows you to browse listings (something that Zillow — a company that appears to be completely unfamiliar with the existence of baseball — describes in its press release as “America’s favorite pastime”) over FaceTime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qFNfmq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An odd use for Apple’s new FaceTime sharing feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9PofEn"&gt;In Zillow’s defense, the company says that 86 percent of its users browse listings with a friend, spouse, or roommate, so making it easier to do over video conferencing does make a certain amount of sense when viewed in that light. And given that SharePlay has native API support in iOS, it can’t be too difficult to integrate support (especially for an app that doesn’t have to worry about things like authenticating streaming logins or perfectly syncing video and audio playback, like streaming apps do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5fFjk"&gt;The new SharePlay feature in Zillow is available now, although you’ll need to make sure that your device is updated to iOS 15.1 or iPadOS 15.1 or later in order to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jonUi5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSVpxq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Costco members can order the Xbox Series X right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IWyYhsVrT8HRt-mMne6msm-30eU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305919/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8b03dj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 11:57AM ET, December 22nd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Costco has sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2yvOx"&gt;The Xbox Series X console has remained hard to come by, and with the holidays looming the window to get one in time is narrowing. Many retailers have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;charging for the chance&lt;/a&gt; just to buy a console via subscription-based memberships, which is a game that Costco has been playing from the beginning. The warehouse retailer has gotten its fair share of console restocks, and today it has Microsoft’s flagship console available for its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;You can order the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-x-1tb-console-with-additional-controller.product.100691493.html"&gt;Xbox Series X from Costco&lt;/a&gt; right now, which is only sold as a bundle with an extra controller. You need a paid Costco membership to order this, which you can get &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html?redirectLogin=true"&gt;here at the retailer’s site&lt;/a&gt; for a minimum of $60 per year. While some video games and accessories can be purchased online from Costco by non-members at the cost of an additional fee, consoles are for members only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z86GFW"&gt;These restocks at Costco often sell out quickly, so if you don’t manage to get it this time around be sure to prep your account for success next time by saving your billing and shipping info into your account.
