    <title>Satellite images show just how bad California’s drought is</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="California Copes With Worsening Drought" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCP_dQ9Qwlt3E_1p2TtxDUbrLFo=/0x1:3407x2272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486508/1233455116.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LAKE ISABELLA, CA - JUNE 14: In an aerial view, cattle graze on June 14, 2021 near Lake Isabella, California. Authorities are bracing for a predicted driest year on record for the Kern River, carrying only about a quarter of its average Sierra snowmelt water to Lake Isabella. The water level of the lake continues to dip below 16 percent capacity and large portion of the west are now in the most extreme drought category, with fire officials warning of another devastating wildfire season in California. | Photo by David McNew/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGfmTS"&gt;Seen from space, California’s drought is horrifying. To get some perspective on the dire situation, the European Space Agency took a satellite image of Angeles National Forest and the San Gabriel Reservoir in Southern California this month and compared that to an image taken around the same time last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brwEgK"&gt;In 2020, the landscape looks lush and green and the San Gabriel Reservoir is bright blue.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fast forward to this year, and the same location is so dry it looks like a scene out of a Mars movie. The forest is scarred red, and the San Gabriel Reservoir is almost empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cnrpm1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10618355"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJUBh"&gt;While 2020 was awful for plenty of other reasons, it did give California a brief break from drought. The Golden State’s longest drought persisted from 2011 to 2019. The relief didn’t last long. This year, Northern California endured&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one of its driest Februarys, which is usually a wetter month, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/02/27/california-drought-nearly-a-quarter-of-california-now-in-drought-feds-say/"&gt;in more than 150 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSW1FA"&gt;The entire western US is in trouble when it comes to water shortages. More than 80 percent of it is parched, with close to half of the region in “extreme” drought. The Hoover Dam reservoir, the largest in the US, hit the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;lowest water level in its history&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. It’s a crucial water source for 25 million people across several states, including California.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xj0NJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The entire western US is in trouble when it comes to water shortages.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SljT3P"&gt;Soaring temperatures that shattered &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/17/heat-wave-southwest-fires-drought/"&gt;hundreds of records&lt;/a&gt; across the US recently are also sucking the west dry. That has essentially turned vegetation into tinder for wildfires. California had its worst fire season on the books last year, when more than twice as many acres burned than the previous state record. Experts say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;there’s even more potential for mega blazes this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxOZkx"&gt;“When we see droughts like this, it really amplifies the fire season,” Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who creates maps for the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;. “This is currently the most exceptional drought that we’ve ever shown on the map in the Western US.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkhTyr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New ‘Designed for Xbox’ displays include the best Xbox Series X support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrFT_SulPVYRkD_tkqQSS0Zjdqg=/120x0:1416x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486427/559M1_Details_Front_insutu_4k_D4Xbox_color_new_CROP.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DnkEHw"&gt;Microsoft is expanding its Designed for Xbox program to include monitors and displays. Some gaming monitors will now include a new “Gaming Features for Xbox” badge that will indicate they support the latest and greatest HDMI 2.1 technology, with variable refresh rates, HDR, and 4K at 120Hz support all for the Xbox Series X / S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzixUf"&gt;At least three HDMI 2.1 displays will get this new badge, including the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.philips.com%2Fc-p%2F559M1RYV_27%2Fmomentum-4k-hdr-display-with-ambiglow&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F22%2F22545193%2Fmicrosoft-designed-for-xbox-displays-monitors-badge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new 55-inch Philips Momentum display&lt;/a&gt;. The Momentum supports 4K resolution at 120Hz with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a dedicated Xbox picture mode, and DisplayHDR 1000 support. Microsoft says it has worked with Philips to validate the display for Xbox Series X / S, and it will launch worldwide for $1,599.99 this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eWg7BIhnPQWMyuf4emv8EgaY8oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674100/559M1RYV_FTL_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 55-inch Philips Momentum is one of the first displays to include Microsoft’s new Xbox badge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qlVU9t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202106AM180000001"&gt;Asus has a 43-inch monitor&lt;/a&gt; that includes 4K at 120Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and DisplayHDR 1000 support. A special Xbox edition, that also includes an Xbox mode — with custom color, contrast, and hue settings — will be available in October, priced at $1,399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvtbzN"&gt;The final monitor in the trio of designed for Xbox displays is a 28-inch Acer Xbox Edition Gaming Monitor. It also supports 4K at 120Hz, with a low 1ms response time, only DisplayHDR 400, and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support. It even includes a built-in KVM switch to let you quickly switch between multiple PCs with a single keyboard, mouse, and monitor setup. Acer is launching its XV282K KV Xbox gaming monitor this fall priced at $949.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MzW2Bv3v11HpALO1Ae7W5GRx44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674106/Acer_Nitro_Monitor_XV2_series_XV282K_KV_SE_XBOXlogowp_01_JPG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s new 28-inch monitor is designed for Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="va3m7w"&gt;These new displays certainly don’t come cheap, but we haven’t seen any bargain HDMI 2.1 monitors so far. Microsoft says this is just the start of its Xbox badge for displays, and the company says more monitors will join the designed for Xbox program in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this amazing montage of 100 3D animations reimagining the same moment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jL_ZU6pP0p47sBDz_6RBh-qsxHs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486392/Still_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Animation by Caleb Worcester&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtwiYD"&gt;A man carries a heavy backpack through a war-ravaged city. A medic pushes a zombified corpse on a stretcher toward an ambulance, as an ominous building with a logo for “Harvest Corp” sits in the background. Then we’re on a bright, vibrantly colored alien world whose surface is a shallow liquid, where an astronaut pulls on a wire dragging a vehicle behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Whzh"&gt;That’s just the first 30 seconds of nearly 11 minutes of strange, beautiful, and imaginative worlds all created based on the same original animation. The video was assembled by Clinton Jones, aka pwnisher, who challenged animators to create their own 3D animated scene based on a bare-bones animation he created. The video rounds up his 100 favorite clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aRgHf"&gt;The premise behind the challenge is to take the initial animation by Jones and have as many artists as possible re-envision it. Jones’ animation is a side view of a person walking, leaning forward, taking large (slightly theatrical) steps. The ground extends into the background under a large orb (a planet? Giant hot air balloon? Up to you!). From that, artists are challenged to make something original. &lt;em&gt;What is that large orb in the background? What is causing the character to struggle walking forward? &lt;/em&gt;Each animation has its own explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwgznLbvHqlfY3eWKqUDxSmLZP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674032/Animation_sidebyside.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the original animation by Clinton Jones (top) and an animation by Kamil Drobek (bottom), one of 2,400 submitted as part of the challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uJiIJm"&gt;The results are simply mesmerizing. Every couple of seconds, we are transported to another artist’s take on a reality based on the original animation. If you’re a fan or familiar with popular 3D rendered art found on Instagram from artists like Beeple or The French Monkey, you might not be surprised to see the amount of alien worlds or remixes of a cyperpunk-bladerunner-akira-like future. That said, they are all beautiful and painfully detailed. So much so that each really feels like a unique world hinting at a backstory that I would love to read or watch more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiVFaY"&gt;The real treats, though, are the animations that are truly unexpected. One riffs on the animation style most associated with Studio Ghibli. Another might actually be stop-motion (if it’s actually a 3D render made to look like stop-motion then it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cool). There’s a really incredibly animated fire-breathing dragon that I rewatched a few times and another surreal behind-the-scenes “green screen” take with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBhwCx"&gt;For those who are curious on what the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of the unused 2,300 renders are like, you can watch all 2,400 rendered animations &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkRjihsMdp8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But just a warning, it’s two hours 44 minutes and 39 seconds long… Although it’s broken up into themes, fantasy, adventure, video games, and comics, so you can skip to a topic of interest or just sit back and watch them all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are at their cheapest price ever for Prime Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700, the best noise-canceling headphones for video conferencing and voice calls." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCm2wE8MNK_kXs9D7vRUPzz9aLU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486201/cwelch_190605_3471_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f9NH8F"&gt;One of the standout deals of Amazon Prime Day 2021 is a huge discount on Bose’s flagship headphones, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Normally priced at $379, today they’re dropping all the way down to $229. If you’re in the market for a pair of wireless headphones that are up there with the very best at quieting the world around you, you might not find a better moment than this to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqsLeS"&gt;The steep discount only applies to the white / rose gold model of the headphones, but the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q9MJKBV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q4QK379/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; headphones are also on sale for $299 — and that’s still a solid deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iSXU5a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612944"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLNJti"&gt;The Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 have a sleek design that stays comfortable no matter how long you wear them. They also have much better voice call performance than their closest competitor, Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones. You can adjust the power of the noise cancellation to your liking, and there’s also a very natural-sounding transparency mode for when you need to maintain awareness of your surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PO5dmq"&gt;These Bose headphones support multipoint, so you can connect to two different devices (like your phone and laptop) at the same time. They last for up to 20 hours of playback on a charge; that falls a bit short of Sony and some other options but should still be plenty to get you through any flight or other travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLXnsx"&gt;For more details on the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;check out my full review&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also rounded up some of the other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22303099"&gt;great deals on earbuds and headphones&lt;/a&gt; that are available during Amazon’s Prime Day 2021 event. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QVjLKc"&gt;If you’ve been thinking about buying some new earbuds or headphones, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535681/amazon-prime-day-tech-news-deals-date-time-2021"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; is a great opportunity to snag something at a fantastic price. The company’s own Echo Buds are on sale, of course, but so are products from Bose, Jabra, Sony, and other brands — with some at the lowest prices we’ve ever seen on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDK3YN"&gt;We’ve rounded up the highlights below. And if you’re shopping for TVs, laptops, or other tech accessories, we’ve also put together a guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22302974"&gt;best Prime Day deals&lt;/a&gt;, which encompasses the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"&gt;best true wireless earbud deals&lt;/a&gt; alongside other product categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9lu3pF"&gt;The best earbuds deals for Prime Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N6W0JP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are already aggressively priced at their regular $119.99, but for Prime Day, the company is dropping them down to $79.99. For that money, you’re getting a set of earbuds that get all the basics right — sound quality, fit, connection stability — and the noise cancellation is better than most other earbuds that sell for a similar price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qXWIjm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UsH3nS"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-improved-Charging-included/dp/B083Q453NG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; remain a great choice for those who need lengthy battery life from their earbuds. They can keep playing for up to 11 hours, which pretty much crushes the competition. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t3tWvR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JDZgr"&gt;By design, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B7LX7N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; let in a lot of the ambient noise around you. So while they’re not a good option if you prefer to hear your music in peace and quiet, I know there are people out there who like hearing the outside world at all times — whether it’s for safety on a run or just to stay aware of their surroundings. Samsung’s stylish beans are great for that purpose. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TWdGvb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612979"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7oswfE"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B091N25RY2?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_361b2fee_65&amp;amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; are $148 at Amazon and they include a free $20 gift card with purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qb5oJ6"&gt;Jabra’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t earbuds&lt;/a&gt; have impressive active noise cancellation, and their sound quality beats out the Apple AirPods Pro. But the biggest trick in Jabra’s arsenal is support for multipoint: unlike pretty much all the other earbuds on this list, you can pair Jabra buds with two devices at the same time. During Prime Day, they’re $69 off. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hXT13y"&gt;If you can do without ANC, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; remain a terrific option for all-around earbuds. They have lively, bass-forward sound, and Jabra’s app allows for a lot of EQ customization. For Prime Day, you can snag them for $95. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c654On"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-400BT-True-Wireless-Earbuds/dp/B08DCLRYWB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser’s CX 400BT earbuds&lt;/a&gt; have essentially the same sublime sound quality as the company’s top-tier Momentum True Wireless 2, but at a lower price. On Prime Day that price is dropping even lower to &lt;s&gt;$100&lt;/s&gt; $80. You lose out on features like noise cancellation and water resistance, but if all you care about is audio quality, this is a good deal to jump on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XFUh8K"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-SP800N-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B087NHB75D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-SP800N fitness earbuds&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $88. With their IP55 rating against dust and water, these earbuds are more durable than many competitors that settle for IPX4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302861/sony-sp800n-noise-canceling-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

This discounted price is much more reasonable for what Razer’s latest true wireless earbuds can offer. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22272549/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-pro-review-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="HDyPRb"&gt;If there’s one can’t-miss deal on headphones for Prime Day, it’s the heavy discount that’s available on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones-Soapstone/dp/B07X5F81JS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s excellent Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;. They’re on sale for only $229 — a far cry from their normal MSRP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TOJehK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612944"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wMda3Q"&gt;If all you’re looking for is a comfortable, reliable set of wireless headphones for around the house, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0117RGG8E/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose SoundLink wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $129. They have multipoint Bluetooth, 15 hours of battery life, and a lightweight design that won’t cause your head any discomfort even after several hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xTBi5O"&gt;There’s also a deal on Sony’s flagship &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B0863TXGM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, which can be had for only $248. The Sonys can outlast Bose’s headphones on battery life, and the two are neck and neck when it comes to noise cancellation. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BkkRqD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LRoJSe"&gt;Jabra’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-Copper/dp/B07RQ366VK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85h noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; don’t get as much attention as those from Sony and Bose, but they still deliver impressive noise cancellation, pleasing sound, multipoint connectivity, and 30-hour battery life. And at a sale price of $158, down from $250, they’re much cheaper than the flashier competitors, too. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18715453/jabra-elite-85h-headphones-review-wireless-noise-canceling-over-ear"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6MujWI"&gt;Sony’s step-down noise-canceling headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-XB900N-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B07RM8WQ8G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WH-XB900N&lt;/a&gt;, are on sale for just $118 for Prime Day. The noise cancellation isn’t quite on par with the pricier model, and you also give up some bells and whistles like ear detection and multipoint, but if the 1000XM4s are too expensive for your taste, these are worth considering. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qEAszA"&gt;Other deals for Prime Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="552qco"&gt;Amazon is running discounts on the different versions of its Echo Frames audio glasses. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Frames/dp/B083C58VDP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;With clear lenses&lt;/a&gt;, you can get them for $175; those usually cost $249.99. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Frames/dp/B08T69DKJ6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The polarized sunglass style&lt;/a&gt; drops to $189.99 (from the usual $269.99). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Patreon doesn’t have ‘special contract’ with Apple to avoid App Store tax</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A still from Apple’s 2021 WWDC presentation on the App Store." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-nDf_aFfTJHSk6Hn69ZykhvnAo=/0x0:1947x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69485855/apple_app_store_wwdc_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZUmGR8"&gt;When you open Patreon’s iPhone app and subscribe to a creator, Apple doesn’t step in the way and take a cut. It turns out, that’s not because of some behind-the-scenes arrangement between the two companies — Apple’s App Store team just decided to give Patreon a pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPEez9"&gt;“I wish we had some special contract with Apple. We don’t,” Patreon CEO Jack Conte &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22543655/patreon-ceo-decoder-interview-jack-conte"&gt;said on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a podcast from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have to deal with the App Store policies and review process like anybody else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mUUCAx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just not the primary behavior that’s happening on Patreon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMUQYy"&gt;On iOS, Apple takes up to a 30 percent cut of in-app payments for digital goods. That means creators on platforms like Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook can expect to lose 30 percent of whatever a fan is paying them to Apple. As more platforms add tools for creators to get paid, the so-called Apple tax has started to look more domineering, taking money away from individual creators and not just huge businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtFdZn"&gt;Patreon has been one of the odd exceptions to the rule. The platform’s iOS app has been able to accept payments outside of Apple’s in-app purchase system, which lets the company walk around that 30 percent cut. Conte suggests this may be allowed because users don’t come to Patreon to discover creators and content. “A lot of the actual engagement is happening on other platforms ... So it’s just not the primary behavior that’s happening on Patreon,” Conte said. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Apple for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFbPHw"&gt;Apple’s rules around creators have increasingly become a point of contention. Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522706/facebook-creators-apple-google-fees-payment-interface-events"&gt;started to highlight&lt;/a&gt; how much money Apple takes, and the creator platform Fanhouse — basically a SFW OnlyFans — has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525904/fanhouse-apple-tax-app-store-creator-fees"&gt;launched a campaign&lt;/a&gt; to get the rules changed. Apple told Fanhouse recently that the app needed to implement its in-app payment system or be removed from the store. After lodging complaints publicly, Fanhouse tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Apple reached out and offered an extension to the end of 2021 to come into compliance with its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTTMte"&gt;Fanhouse says it is now going through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299814/apple-app-store-policies-ios-bug-fixes-approval-dispute-appeal"&gt;Apple’s formal process&lt;/a&gt; to request a change to the App Store rules, looking for an exception for payments to creators. (Fanhouse says it previously filed a submission through Apple’s review process but was “ignored.”) The company has pointed to Patreon as an example of a creator-focused app that doesn’t have to pay the Apple tax, but Fanhouse founders say they have not received an explanation for why they can’t replicate the same model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder wants you to actually talk to people before you match</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xrFmSU-SHX36FfPh69170C3EjpA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69485704/Video_in_Profile___multi.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7bpIP"&gt;Tinder’s making some big updates to its app this week, mostly in the name of giving people more context about a person they might want to date. The app’s getting an explore tab, similarly to Instagram, that’ll let people find different ways to interact with and meet potential matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63GKG6"&gt;In the explore tab, you’ll find activities like Swipe Night, Tinder’s interactive video game, and a new feature called Hot Takes. In that mode, which occurs nightly from 6PM to midnight local time, daters will answer questions like, “Which of these is the most pretentious?” and then they’ll volley in a chat with it disappearing if no one responds for 30 seconds. Participants can like each other and match from this screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyT0AM"&gt;This is the first time daters will be able to talk before actually committing to a match, and the idea is clearly to give them something to talk about and therefore assess the actual conversation chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5whj6JSgRCNe82AAR52z3Qd2Zqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665895/Hot_Takes___multi.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tinder&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o576Lz"&gt;Daters can also, from the explore tab, decide to cycle through possible matches that share their “&lt;a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046122691-Interests"&gt;passions&lt;/a&gt;” or tags they put on their profile. People can, for example, select that they only want to view people who are considered “thrill seekers,” likely because they listed rock climbing and hiking as a passion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuYnHm"&gt;The idea, says CEO Jim Lanzone, is to give people more control when they want it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc2vyi"&gt;“It’s just giving you more options of ways to navigate people, and I think you’ll see a lot more from us down that pathway, as well, putting more control in people’s hands,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MJfw81"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first step in Tinder becoming more of a platform than just an app”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IISKs1"&gt;Daters can always return to Tinder’s usual mode that surfaces people outside those parameters, Lanzone notes, but this, for the first time, lets them set up filters of a sort, beyond location and age, for Tinder’s algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uRBZ0"&gt;And finally, Tinder will allow people to upload videos as part of their profiles. Up to nine videos are supported — the total amount of media allowed in a profile — and they can be up to 10 seconds long. None of the features will be behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NEBei"&gt;Lanzone describes all of these changes as “the first step in Tinder becoming more of a platform than just an app.” This isn’t about becoming an “entertainment hub,” he says, but rather about helping people meet others and develop strength in an area he calls “swipe possibly,” or basically the part in the dating process where people might have their interest piqued by a person but want to know more before committing to a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhKG6b"&gt;Broadly, all of these features continue to expand on Tinder’s efforts to make it more than just an app to judge people off their photos. It’s attempting to give daters more context, more ways to open conversation, and more reason to use the app. Lanzone says as the team continues to innovate, its main guiding principle will be to not slow down the app’s “kinetic energy.” So basically, the swipe likely isn’t going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom is adding new options for sharing your pronouns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a Zoom window showing three people on a call. All three people have their pronouns in parentheses next to their names. Behind the window is a light blue background with different pronouns listed across it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7i_8Z68wPfVGwVh8OWDVD2A0-rg=/104x0:875x514/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69485699/Picture1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Zoom call with pronouns displayed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SBemKY"&gt;Zoom is adding a &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-pronoun-sharing/"&gt;new field for pronouns&lt;/a&gt; today, along with options to manage when they’re displayed. Pronouns will appear in parentheses next to people’s names in calls, essentially the same as how they’ve looked up until now when people have manually entered them. They’ll also be visible under people’s names on their profile cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRA4Sy"&gt;Pronouns will be visible by default on the profile pages for accounts on the free Basic Zoom plan, as well as for accounts with a single licensed user. The field will be off by default for accounts with multiple users, though administrators can turn it on in their account settings. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set Zoom to ask if you’d like to share your pronouns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qBquxE"&gt;People can also decide whether they want their pronouns to be shared in meetings and webinars. There are options in profile settings for Zoom to always share, never share, or to ask during every meeting if pronouns should be displayed. This flexibility could be useful for people who use different pronouns in various settings, but it’s important to note that pronouns are currently always visible in the profile card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCOlbG"&gt;Zoom is among several sites and services that have rolled out dedicated pronoun fields recently. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431055/instagram-pronoun-profile-update-setting"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444705/slack-pronouns-field-profiles"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; both added them last month, and Twitter is working on a pronoun field for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;revamped profiles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
