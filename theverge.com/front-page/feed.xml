    <title>Google discontinues the Google Home Max </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F3D1fk"&gt;Google is no longer manufacturing the Google Home Max, its smart speaker designed with high-quality sound in mind, and it has sold out of the product on the Google Store, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, if you check the Google Home Max page &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_home_max"&gt;on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that the white and black models are listed as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOhs3q"&gt;Even though Google is discontinuing the Google Home Max, the company still plans to support it with software updates and security fixes. “Existing Google Home Max users shouldn’t worry as they won’t see any change in their service,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “We’ll continue to offer software updates and security fixes to Google Home Max devices. We’re committed to delivering great sound and whole home audio features across all of our Assistant-enabled products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLa5dQ"&gt;The Google Home Max launched in December 2017 for $399. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16797728/google-home-max-smart-speaker-assistant-review"&gt;his review&lt;/a&gt;, Dan Seifert found that the Google Home Max sounded good on its own, but wasn’t quite as nice as Sonos’ similar Play:5. Google’s newest smart speaker is the Nest Audio, which it launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The Nest Audio costs $99.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest settles gender discrimination lawsuit brought by former COO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pinterest Takes Stock Public On New York Stock Exchange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ap_lm0lAimKc778HIx0ny7zOyg4=/0x0:6693x4462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68513005/1143514663.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N3dVUU"&gt;Pinterest is &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1506293/000150629320000291/pins-20201214.htm"&gt;settling a gender discrimination lawsuit brought by former COO Françoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt; for $22.5 million. Pinterest and Brougher will also jointly contribute $2.5 million to philanthropies supporting women and underrepresented minorities in the tech industry. The remaining amount will be paid to Brougher and her attorneys. News of the agreement was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hyrb7"&gt;The settlement is one of the largest in a publicly announced, individual gender discrimination lawsuit. Brougher’s lawyer told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that while private agreements can be bigger, they don’t hold companies accountable in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gj7KLq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is one of the largest in a publicly announced, individual gender discrimination lawsuit.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PX8CRY"&gt;In her complaint, which was filed in August, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;Brougher said she was paid less than her male colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly left out of important meetings, and given gendered feedback by Pinterest CFO Todd Morgenfeld. When she spoke up about this mistreatment, she says she was fired. Morgenfeld still works at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pwDFl"&gt;The complaint followed public statements from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks&lt;/a&gt;, two Black women on the policy team who said they’d faced racism and sexism at the company. Both said they were underpaid despite leading major initiatives at Pinterest, including banning anti-vax posts and putting an end to the promotion of plantation weddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teivXW"&gt;Ozoma and Banks got less than a year’s severance when they left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkuZtj"&gt;Pinterest announced an outside lawyer was conducting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/pinterest-hires-outside-lawyer-to-investigate-workplace-culture"&gt;an independent investigation into its culture&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of these allegations. Yet more stories continued to pour out. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published an article&lt;/a&gt; detailing new allegations of workplace discrimination and retaliation — particularly for women and people of color on the finance team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJMAsX"&gt;In a joint statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;Brougher and Pinterest said: “Pinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture. Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pushes return to office to September and will test flexible work week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NI_d9NxfAymwxWMdQnLdUEczjoA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512915/acastro_170808_1777_google_logo_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HCPruE"&gt;Google has pushed back its return to the office until September, and will experiment with a hybrid model allowing some employees to work from home part of the week, the company said. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/google-delays-return-to-office-and-eyes-flexible-work-week.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Google CEO Sundar Pichai emailed employees Sunday about plans to test a flexible work week once conditions are safe for people to return. Google employees would work three days in the office and the rest of the week at home under the new plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeUpzt"&gt;Pichai said the company is testing whether such a model would lead to greater productivity and employee well-being. “No company at our scale has ever created a fully hybrid work force model — though a few are starting to test it — so it will be interesting to try,” Pichai wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43NPnw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/google-ceo-email-delays-return-to-sept-2021-no-permanent-remote-work.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1607976163"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, Google’s hybrid work model would require employees to live within commuting distance to their offices, and a fully-remote option wasn’t offered. And some employees may not be eligible for a flexible work week, such as those who need access to specialized equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDdcvd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter, and Square are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21261798/square-employees-work-from-home-remote-premanent-policy-ceo"&gt;among the companies&lt;/a&gt; to announce they would permanently extend their current fully-remote work policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05YOOq"&gt;Google was one of the earliest tech companies to go fully remote as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173994/google-coronavirus-north-american-employees-work-from-home-sick-leave-fund"&gt;telling employees in March&lt;/a&gt; to work from home to support social distancing. It previously said it would keep its 200,000 full-time and contract employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340038/google-remote-working-employees-2021-twitter-facebook-alphabet"&gt;working remotely until July 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but has now pushed that date back again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber fined $59 million for dodging questions about sexual assaults</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfNE6aIeei3CYmxhy3nvs_MEABY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512756/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QJe06T"&gt;Uber has 30 days to pay a $59 million fine to California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for failing to answer the regulator’s questions about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;damning safety report&lt;/a&gt; released by the company in December 2019. If Uber doesn’t pay up &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;answer the outstanding questions, CPUC could suspend the company’s license to operate in the state, an &lt;a href="http://efile.cpuc.ca.gov/FPSS/0000158867/1.pdf"&gt;administrative law judge ruled on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yc8ov0"&gt;It’s the latest development in Uber’s long history of trouble with violence and assault between its drivers and passengers — trouble that competitor Lyft shares, too. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. News of the fine was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-to-Uber-Pay-59-million-and-give-data-15801080.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hLPHRr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Regulators want to know more about Uber’s own damning safety report, released in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHHRZw"&gt;The report, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;Uber itself called “jarring” at the time&lt;/a&gt;, detailed thousands of sexual assaults in the US that happened in 2017 and 2018 during trips taken with the company’s ride-hailing platform. While the &lt;a href="https://www.uber-assets.com/image/upload/v1575580686/Documents/Safety/UberUSSafetyReport_201718_FullReport.pdf"&gt;84-page report&lt;/a&gt; included a fair amount of data in aggregate, CPUC wanted to know more shortly after it was released — especially because Uber admitted in the fine print that the report did not “assess or take any position on whether any of the reported incidents actually occurred.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk0HKn"&gt;The CPUC has regulatory authority over transportation companies in the state and regularly investigates complaints against them. So it asked Uber a handful of questions about who authored the report, and also asked Uber for specific details on each incident of assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCX7dX"&gt;Uber never answered the questions, claiming that further disclosure would present a privacy risk for both the assault survivors and its employees. In January 2020, a judge denied the company’s request to avoid answering, saying Uber could file the answers under seal in order to protect confidentiality. Uber continued to fight answering the CPUC’s questions throughout the year until up Monday’s ruling, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RX5NI"&gt;In the ruling, the judge described those efforts as little more than “specious legal roadblocks” meant to “frustrate the Commission’s ability to gather information” about whether Uber is operating safely. The judge arrived at the $59 million figure by levying a $7,500 fine for every specific time that Uber refused to answer each question during the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8buolO"&gt;“Uber is a billion-dollar business that can easily afford to pay ... [e]ven during a pandemic where ridership has undoubtedly declined,” the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yrravQwglpzWOC1tZVT479bwzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney World is going to stop photoshopping masks onto people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of the castle at Disney World Orlando" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UyM6V5g7RwaBAB_DVD62Skj5YI0=/0x316:1331x1203/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512541/walt_disney_world_castle.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Becky O’Bryan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SgOYS"&gt;Today in stories that make you go “Wait, &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;”, &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/update-walt-disney-world-no-longer-placing-digital-face-masks-over-maskless-guests-in-on-ride-photos-statement-issued/"&gt;Disney World is going to stop digitally adding masks&lt;/a&gt; to people who don’t have them in their on-ride pictures, according to a report from &lt;em&gt;WDW News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT0y7W"&gt;Even if you’ve never been to a theme park, you’ve probably seen these kinds of photos: people on a roller coaster screaming or reacting in some funny way to whatever’s happening, captured by a camera built into the ride and sold at some crazy price. In the age of COVID-19, however, Disney has had to adapt to how it handles these pictures. For example, previously, if someone wasn’t wearing a mask on the ride, &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/07/guests-not-wearing-face-masks-on-attractions-will-not-receive-in-ride-photo-at-walt-disney-world/"&gt;neither they nor anybody else in the picture&lt;/a&gt; would be able to download it in the Disney app or get it printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iutd5Z"&gt;It’s understandable how this could cause some annoyance — if you were wearing your mask on the ride, why shouldn’t you be able to get the picture just because someone else wasn’t? Disney’s solution to this, apparently, was to start &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/photo-walt-disney-world-now-placing-digital-face-masks-over-maskless-guests-in-on-ride-photos/"&gt;digitally adding masks to non-wearers&lt;/a&gt; (rather poorly, as you can see in the tweet below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KrU6AT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you refuse to wear a mask on a Disney ride, cast members will photoshop one onto your face for the picture wall &lt;a href="https://t.co/4gocKiaLx0"&gt;https://t.co/4gocKiaLx0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Claire Downs (@clairecdowns) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clairecdowns/status/1336918024117342209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SErsan"&gt;It’s unclear when exactly Disney started doing this, but it announced over the weekend that it was going to stop, saying in a statement that it had “tested modifying some ride photos”, but that it will “no longer doing this and continue to expect guests to wear face coverings except when actively eating or drinking while stationary.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjph8z"&gt;What’s not clear yet is whether Disney will go back to its stricter photo policy, where it won’t allow anyone in the photo to purchase a copy if someone isn’t wearing a mask in it. Either way, it’s a good idea to wear a mask even regardless of whether your vacation pictures depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook launches its Collab music app to the public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Facebook Collab logo next to a smartphone showing a screenshot of the Collab interface." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gqPy438PDczMoiCXhZ8HY3T43qk=/0x15:768x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512379/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.00.57_AM_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaB9TH"&gt;Facebook has publicly launched Collab, an experimental music-making app that first launched as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21270640/facebook-collab-npe-invite-only-beta-release-music-making-app"&gt;invite-only beta&lt;/a&gt; back in May, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jTqAn"&gt;The app allows users to create short-form music videos by combining up to three independent videos. So, for example, three musicians could each play a different part of a song and combine them into one video. But each video that’s created is also posted to a public “Collab” feed, where people can view and play along with it if they choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FeEiI"&gt;So you could also record one part, then mix it with two other parts you find on the Collab feed that other people have recorded. Or you can just mix other people’s videos together — you don’t need to be a musician yourself. (Every user is properly credited for their contributions, according to Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLWkdJ"&gt;You won’t have to worry about lining all the videos up — Collab includes in-app tools to sync the parts together. Per its App Store page, “We make sure that as you swipe, the videos play at exactly the right moment to be in sync.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nD70JX"&gt;The app isn’t directly integrated with Facebook (yet, at least), but you can export the finished products to your Instagram story (as well as other platforms, including TikTok) via iOS share sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOLd38"&gt;Collab is free on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collab-band-together/id1507800473"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and you can download it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bxwQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woEYCQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 leak shows off the upcoming 2021 flagship in photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewUM02R_Z9tORzE39Ylx8ymVTIk=/0x1:1874x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512324/oneplus_9_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images of a prototype device confirm some previously leaked spec. | Photo: PhoneArena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vov8Sx"&gt;The OnePlus 9 likely won’t arrive until spring 2021, but thanks to some &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-9-5g-hands-on-specs-leak-exclusive_id129026"&gt;photos published by &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we won’t have to wait that long for a glimpse of it. The images are of an alleged prototype device complete with unique pre-prod branding, and some software screengrabs reveal a little extra detail about the upcoming flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG6KWK"&gt;First up: the screen. It looks like OnePlus will stick with the flat screen format it used in the OnePlus 8 and 8T – the 9 has a flat 6.55-inch display with a hole punch camera in the upper left corner. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s screen features a design that curves around the edges of the phone, which we found lead to more accidental touches than occurred with the flat version. &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena &lt;/em&gt;reports that the 9’s screen is a 2400 x 1080 panel with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jFYLMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 8 review: familiar formula","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219278/oneplus-8-review-specs-features-camera-battery-screen-price-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8 Pro review: big league","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8T review: the numbers game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CDjerY"&gt;The pre-prod device also looks to include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888 processor&lt;/a&gt;, the chipset of choice for 2021 flagship phones. And that leads into another previously leaked OnePlus 9 feature: 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbvvAx"&gt;As for imaging hardware, the images show a camera bump pushed to the upper left corner of the device’s rear. There’s also new “Ultrashot” branding on the bump not seen on previous models, though it may or may not remain on the final device. The specs gleaned from this early look don’t give away exact details about camera sensor resolution or focal length, but it seems likely that two of the rear cameras seen in these photos will be standard wide and ultrawide modules. The third could be a macro or depth-sensing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SIM card slot and USB-C port on the OnePlus 9" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dGuOND5MSj5KH4h8sSbq6SA3V2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170084/oneplus_9_leak_4.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A look at the SIM card slot and USB-C port on the upcoming OnePlus phone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lL48kO"&gt;Other details include a 4500 mAh battery, Android 11 with Oxygen OS, and a version with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM (there will likely be an option with a different memory configuration). There’s no confirmed launch date for the OnePlus 9, but the company’s schedule for past releases — and the timing of this leak — mean early spring 2021 looks likely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Fitting a lot of tech into a small space&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gBdQ3J"&gt;Working from home has its advantages, but one of the problems that many people have to face is trying to find enough space in a crowded environment. Jon Porter, who is the London-based news reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has had to be especially resourceful in putting together a place where he could report, write, and review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1FcUQ"&gt;We talked to Jon to find out how he’s managed to do such great reporting out of a small space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2qSlJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdG2ny"&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s UK-based news reporter. I’ve lived in London basically my entire life, and I’ve been with the site for a little over two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwWlGG"&gt;Day-to-day, I’m responsible for covering any tech news that breaks during UK hours before the US wakes up. But once the East Coast is awake, I can get down to business &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36QUbG5nPDk&amp;amp;t=97s"&gt;reviewing phones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c8UdKX6GBA"&gt;building keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"&gt;complaining about the iPhone’s lack of USB-C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFXAFp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEmUES"&gt;That’s putting it lightly. I share my flat in London with three other people, so a corner of my bedroom is about as much space as I can spare for a home office. I honestly don’t think I’d manage it if I hadn’t lucked out and found this desk being given away for free on the weekend I moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_vvFBYtuLs0xpj0G4wkSU1Vfq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158036/jporter_201208_4323_0019.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kwYkh6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you manage that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMPZ9y"&gt;When we moved in, the flat was completely unfurnished, and we spent the first few months frantically scouring through services like &lt;a href="https://www.freecycle.org"&gt;Freecycle&lt;/a&gt; for any furniture people were giving away. Long story short, we met some people who were leaving the country and had a flat full of stuff to get rid of, so we rented a van and carted it all home. The van broke down en-route (don’t ask), but most of the furniture has served us well ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9UwEu"&gt;All of which is to say that I have absolutely no idea where the desk is from, who made it, or how much it would cost to buy new. But it’s very good at packing in a lot of stuff. There’s a little shelf under the monitor where I have a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-4-pro-black-1tb%2F10134659.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 4 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and an Arcam irDAC stashed, and the keyboard tray lets me keep the desk surface itself clear-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ShiGy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a wrist rest you have in front of your keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM3U28"&gt;Absolutely! I love mechanical keyboards, but their keys are so tall compared to laptop-style keys that I find I need a rest to keep my wrists at a comfortable angle. I know you’re technically supposed to keep your hands raised while you type, but honestly that’s just so exhausting on my arms that I’ve never been able to stick with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDuWdk"&gt;The keyboard itself is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Filco-Majestouch-2-Tenkeyless-FKBN87M-EB2/dp/B004WOF7QM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b7e79c45caf9815118023c76fc3a2e2a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Filco Majestouch 2 Tenkeyless with Cherry MX Brown&lt;/a&gt; switches. I firmly believe that Filco makes the keyboards that feel the best to type on, and they’re what I’d recommend to anyone looking for a keyboard. The only problem is that the lettering on their keycaps can wear out a little quickly, so I swapped out the stock caps for a set manufactured by GMK. Oh, and I also installed a programmable keyboard controller in there so I could add some keyboard shortcuts for turning the volume up and down and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxHK7zIUKVyNvUU7G3O5F3-PyUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158042/jporter_201208_4323_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wArvXR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looks like you’ve got a classy desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0J1M5"&gt;This Herman Miller Aeron was the main investment I made this year after I’d been working from home full time for a few months. I bought it after I got tired of having to sit with a pillow supporting my lower back to stop it from hurting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCFDdM"&gt;In normal times I probably would have actually gone into a store and tried out a bunch of chairs in person, but unfortunately that wasn’t really possible. Instead I played it safe, and bought the chair that always seems to come up whenever people online talk about the best office chairs. I got my Aeron secondhand off eBay from a company that was clearly selling leftovers from office clearouts, but it’s treated me well so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjMlQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226965"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0WqRz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jWYqV"&gt;Alrighty! It’s a bit of a work-in-progress at the moment while I wait for AMD’s new CPUs and Nvidia’s new graphics cards to come down in price, but for the time being I’m running an &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU&lt;/a&gt; paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17877968/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-review-benchmarks-performance-features"&gt;Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; and 16GB of RAM. That’s all packed into a &lt;a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=522&amp;amp;area=en"&gt;Silverstone FT05 case&lt;/a&gt; which, much like my keyboard, I like because it’s incredibly understated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iATjCQ"&gt;One day I want to upgrade that GPU to an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726553874957965631" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, slap a &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-5600x"&gt;Ryzen 5600X&lt;/a&gt; in there, and downsize the whole machine into a small form-factor case, but who knows when that’ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVhCx9sSAagAn8noTcUN1wDNul8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158038/jporter_201208_4323_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZaMdR4s9AbPw39CWImLx9mU14Aw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158040/jporter_201208_4323_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hefi-igiQlWja18O51fvV1JPIXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158035/jporter_201208_4323_0021.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HrpsS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got an interesting arrangement of displays. You’ve got one hanging off the wall, and the other is, well, impressively big. How did you come up with this arrangement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdqI7r"&gt;I have to confess this isn’t how I’d have things set up if I had the choice. My main monitor is an &lt;a href="https://agon.aocmonitorap.com/au/product_ag352UCG.php"&gt;AOC AG352UCG 1440p ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; which would normally be out of my price range, but I got a deal on it because it’s a little… well… broken. Its DisplayPort works perfectly, and it supports G-Sync to keep games running smoothly, but unfortunately the HDMI port seems to be busted, so I can’t use it with the PS4 Pro I’ve got sitting underneath it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiFoZu"&gt;That’s why I have the second monitor sitting in landscape orientation to the left of it, for the PlayStation. Otherwise I’d have it in portrait and use it to read Twitter or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAlm3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yN25ln"&gt;From left to right there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Textured-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d9858b9243b3e5ec844044ebc69beb4&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Snowball microphone&lt;/a&gt;, which does exactly what I need it to and means I can get away with wearing normal headphones on calls. Then we’ve got my &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726554111787728059" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech Z200 speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which were just the cheapest I could find. They’re fine, but whenever I’m listening to something that matters I’m using headphones or streaming to an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-black-00464617%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22165831%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jon-porter-nvidia-ps4-tech#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea Symfonisk Sonos speaker lamp&lt;/a&gt; I have on the other side of the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F6y9Df"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10227163"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LzfHjp"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBXNV58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=fa544d7577613f1571bfde2ea745914c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; stand on my desk for when my phone needs extra juice during the day, which rarely happens now that I’m at home all the time but it’s nice to know it’s there. The PS4 Pro sitting to the right of it needs no introduction. That little bar sitting on top of it is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-W010-Wireless-Sensor-DolphinBar/dp/B00HZWEB74/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=75a36df2d93c99d0fded1ce39e3c96ff&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mayflash W010 USB sensor bar&lt;/a&gt;, like the Nintendo Wii console used to have. I bought one for my PC so I could use it to emulate Wii games, and hopefully get around to completing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 3&lt;/em&gt; one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoybT3"&gt;Next up is the Arcam irDAC which handles audio for both the PS4 and my PC, and those accessories on top of it are an Anker SD card reader and a pair of Samsung’s Galaxy Beans, ahem sorry, Galaxy Buds Live. There’s a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flogitech-c920%2Fp%2FN82E16826104635&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 webcam&lt;/a&gt; on top of my monitor with a privacy shutter, and I have a bunch of USB cables hanging off of what’s supposed to be a headphone hook to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9v8i2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oyxbRJ"&gt;Phew, that sounds like a lot! But remember that I live in a flatshare, so I basically have one room that all my tech lives in. One day all this stuff will spread out when I have the space for it, but for now it’s all here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZv_Aun3vNC1Ea3nH3824TetVSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158041/jporter_201208_4323_0011.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5iSzhzRpOtl2LBQUs14HHwUM60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158033/jporter_201208_4323_0024.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yR7QFz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a relatively clean desk — is that how you like to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jp037d"&gt;In my ideal world, this would be how tidy I keep it all of the time. But the reality is that when review season hits and the devices start rolling in, I quickly end up with piles of phones, headphones, coffee cups, and whatever else on my desk. Thankfully we’re in a bit of a quieter period at the moment so I can keep things a little more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSeQdT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see there’s a notebook front and center.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfgPGD"&gt;It’s the only way I can stay organized. I know there are lots of good to-do list apps out there, but for me nothing beats keeping track of work using a physical notepad. Every day I force myself to write out what needs to be done, and the manual process helps me to remember each task. I also just find it much more convenient to quickly note down something on a physical pad while I’m on the phone, rather than trying to do everything from the same device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSr9zz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a pint glass I see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBwJ7H"&gt;Gotta keep hydrated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXi6DJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your guitar. Do you keep it nearby for occasional breaks, or is that just a handy place to store it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YULd6c"&gt;Oh, it’s totally just a musical fidget spinner. Whenever I’m stuck, I pick up the guitar, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fender-Player-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar/dp/B07CTYNK7C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ccf904b38de122cfc30f90e8f67d7bbf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mexican-made Fender Stratocaster&lt;/a&gt;, and play a couple of chords while I think. I also used to play a lot while I waited for things to load, but SSDs put an end to that. I must have had it for 15 years or so, and although I rarely get around to playing seriously anymore, I could never bring myself to part with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKNo8C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yFIezv"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>The Office is leaving Netflix, but its first two seasons will be free on Peacock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_ZnadpbdVnW9ScOZxuX8Xb3sTE=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512209/theofficepeacock.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peacock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34ETVF"&gt;The end of an era is approaching: &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;will leave&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Netflix on January 1st and exclusively move over to Peacock, NBCUniversal’s streaming service. Peacock confirmed the January 1st launch date today and explained how viewers can watch all 201 episodes of the show. The first two seasons will be available for free, but seasons 3 through 9 will require a paid subscription. Viewers can either pay $4.99 per month with ads or $9.99 monthly without ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbKASM"&gt;Peacock’s building out an entire experience around the show, which will likely be an important one for the service and potentially encourage many more people to subscribe. Subscribers can view extra material, like behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, and interviews as well as curated collections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuYrKg"&gt;The loss is a big one for Netflix, although the company knew the date was coming. The show’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;widely considered one of its most popular with more than 52 billion minutes watched in 2018, some 3 percent of all Netflix minutes watched in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-battles-rivals-for-its-most-watched-shows-friends-and-the-office-11556120136"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pweoFa"&gt;As Netflix loses more of these comfort watches, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035338/friends-netflix-leaving-january-2020-hbo-max-may-streaming-seinfeld-the-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll have to rely on its in-house content to maintain its subscriber base, while also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;charging more&lt;/a&gt; so it can keep making shows. It’s already cranking out content routinely, which gave it a major advantage in 2020 when most video shoots were sidelined because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But now, Netflix is entering the new year with the loss of one major show and a backlog of content to shoot and prepare for the service. It might have a rough year or two ahead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229587/netflix-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-streaming-entertainment"&gt;depending on when shooting resumes&lt;/a&gt; and how well its competitors are able to produce their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxEC2d"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qm0oCU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
