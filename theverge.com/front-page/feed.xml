    <title>The Fortnite island flipped over during Chapter 2’s final event</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7y7ROd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; big chapter-ending event just ended, and it was a big one. After an all-out war against UFOs, zombies, and the Cube Queen, players were saved in a rescue mission led by Dwayne Johnson. (Well, his in-game character.) Then, the island flipped over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ltc4yY"&gt;The event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rrOiPg"&gt;Let’s back up a bit. The game’s latest season has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;all about the cubes&lt;/a&gt;, and right when the event loaded up, a mysterious giant blue cube spawned on the map next to all of the players in my lobby. Jumping at the cube bounced players away, but it otherwise, didn’t do anything beyond loom ominously. We also could look at the Cube Queen in the distance, which has been floating in an energy ball over the center of the island for part of the season. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyngylDLXA8sXyzize2dhGAAgq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063270/IMG_1454.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, blue cube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xyZP7rFCyAS1qvKdo_vUhKGC-l8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063427/IMG_1457.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cube Queen floats menacingly in the distance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xW8QJz"&gt;When the even’t countdown clock reached 10 minutes, the Cube Queen’s evil laugh echoed over the island and zombies started spawning in front of our base. Fortunately, weapons were added to everyone’s inventory, so players worked to fend off the incoming zombie troopers (though the zombies didn’t seem to pose any real threat).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MNK_riUlL539Qrsz07GmoNafueA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063437/IMG_1458.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay back!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1YFjl"&gt;When the clock reached zero, an alarm blared over the island, and the Cube Queen’s pyramid shone bright. She launched a beam into the sky that opened up a huge portal revealing a horde of giant UFOs. During the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;seventh season&lt;/a&gt;, the island was under the shadow of just one UFO; the Cube Queen had brought an army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDKtJG"&gt;UFOs and zombies approached the blue cube as players tried to fend them off. But the battle began to look unwinnable, and things went from bad to worse when a UFO blew up the blue cube. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpGGsy-uxF_jTLehS2yfywUrpME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063439/IMG_1465.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RwJ5A0"&gt;After that, the event took an interesting twist, moving the perspective under the surface of the island to a CGI cutscene. (It was kind of like if Netflix made a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; TV show.) The game’s main character, Agent Jones, was strapped to a laboratory chair with a device on his head, and Doctor Slone, who betrayed players at the end of last season, was seemingly about to end Jones’ life. Then, a hulking figure known as The Foundation burst in to save the day — and he took off his mask to reveal that he’s played by, &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/fortnite-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-teases-his-role-as-the-foundation-in-new-energy-drink"&gt;as suspected&lt;/a&gt;, none other than Dwayne Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfX7Gc"&gt;As Jones and The Foundation tried to get to safety, two other characters dressed similarly to The Foundation rescued players on the surface and brought them down to the inner island. Players were then given control to follow someone called The Scientist to get to Jones and The Foundation. But during the escape, the island began to tip over bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgPM-iYrIV5Gcz4oWBV0kinPzkQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063440/IMG_1462.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The island began to tip over slowly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x2bUzD"&gt;Eventually, players made it to Jones and The Foundation at the Zero Point (essentially a big ball of energy that has been a key plot point in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;). The Scientist assured everyone that we were safe, but then one of the giant zombies smashed a window, causing water to rush in and for all of us to be forced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W38q40"&gt;Soon, my character surfaced and watched as the island slowly tipped up to be completely vertical and then fall the other way. That crushed the Cube Queen, which caused the giant portal with the UFOs to close up. Then the island flipped all the way over revealing a whole new landscape. At a distance, you could see a little bit of the new areas to explore, but a tidal wave quickly swept my player out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jDiqjZ"&gt;When will Fortnite be back?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ymml0JsfclZsh1AYTFxU1dG5h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063392/IMG_1464.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just me and the open water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8U68t5"&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; just shows my player at sea on an empty log. I can’t move, and there’s hardly anything on screen except for me, my log, and the vast open ocean. It’s all reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/dca1e75e-a6d7-45c9-bcfe-687edf804521#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite%2Dgame%2Dshutdown%2Dblack%2Dhole%2Devent%2Dstorytelling"&gt;bla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/dca1e75e-a6d7-45c9-bcfe-687edf804521#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite%2Dgame%2Dshutdown%2Dblack%2Dhole%2Devent%2Dstorytelling"&gt;k hole&lt;/a&gt; that bridged the transition between Chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc195h"&gt;There’s no timer or any sort of indication of when Chapter 3 might be playable. But if you want a sneak peek of what’s to come, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817525/fortnite-chapter-3-leaked-trailer-spider-man-new-island-gears-of-war"&gt;a leaked trailer&lt;/a&gt; looks to have spoiled a lot of what you can expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkeLHf"&gt;This chapter, which kicked off in October 2019 after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;multi-day downtime featuring the black hole&lt;/a&gt;, pushed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;growing narrative ambitions&lt;/a&gt; with events featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;first-person storytelling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;an arcade shooter against a Marvel villain&lt;/a&gt;, a thrilling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;single-player event to try and stabilize reality&lt;/a&gt;, and even a mission inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an alien mothership full of cubes&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 2’s concluding event took things another step forward, and now we’ll have to wait and see what Epic has in store for Chapter 3. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard won’t play a part at The Game Awards this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dcd527AmZe8fDHYM2xNpt-Ux18s=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229215/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAxe1p"&gt;Geoff Keighley, the executive producer and host of The Game Awards, sent out a tweet to confirm that outside of its nominations, Activision Blizzard “will not be a part of this year’s #TheGameAwards.” This is in light of claims about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"&gt;the company’s toxic culture&lt;/a&gt;, as well as allegations of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;CEO Bobby Kotick’s history of abuse and harassment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lzDblY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beyond its nominations, I can confirm that Activision|Blizzard will not be a part of this year’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheGameAwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467007741214347264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pm3aij"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/game-awards-announcements/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Keighley hinted at Activision Blizzard’s potential removal from the award show, noting that he was contemplating how to “navigate” the situation with the company without harming its developers or employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPUQZG"&gt;Although Activision Blizzard won’t have a role in this year’s Game Awards, the company may still cast some influence over the show. Rob Kostich, the president of Activision Blizzard serves on &lt;a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/about"&gt;The Game Awards’ board of advisors&lt;/a&gt;. While the board doesn’t have a say in terms of which games receive nominations and awards, it still helps “guide and advance the mission” of The Game Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="svBS8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no place for abuse, harassment predatory practices in any company or any community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eW5G9M"&gt;Other game companies have spoken out about the controversy surrounding Activision Blizzard, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation sending out a company-wide notice&lt;/a&gt; to condemn the claims, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;Xbox boss Phil Spencer saying&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is reevaluating its relationship with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUpXjR"&gt;“There is no place for abuse, harassment or predatory practices in any company or any community,” Keighley wrote. “We all need to work together to build a better and a more inclusive environment so everyone feels safe to build the world’s best games.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify removes popular comedians’ content over royalties dispute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rci_RmjlUAmzi6qNx9Tet_QCtGs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228946/acastro_180213_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDBNxY"&gt;Spotify has pulled the works of some of the most popular comedians, including Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish, John Mulaney, and Jim Gaffigan due to a royalties dispute. First reported by &lt;a href="http://wsj.com/articles/spotify-removes-some-comedians-work-from-streaming-service-11638626401"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a number of high-profile entertainers are pursuing royalty payments for their jokes when they’re played on the radio, as well as on services like Spotify, Pandora, YouTube, and SiriusXM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zZqTr3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After failed negotiations with Spoken Giants, Spotify removed hundreds of comedians’ content from the service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MHdoNv"&gt;The comics’ efforts are backed by global rights administration company, Spoken Giants, which works to ensure that entertainers are properly compensated for spoken-word content. As the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, comedians are typically paid by their label or distributor — along with digital performance rights organization SoundExchange — when a digital service plays their content. However, they’re technically not compensated for writing that content, something that Spoken Giants hopes to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhuy2q"&gt;After failed negotiations with Spoken Giants, Spotify removed hundreds of comedians’ content from the service. In a statement to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Spotify said that it already paid “significant amounts of money for the content in question, and would love to continue to do so.” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Spotify with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CM5o5"&gt;There’s no word whether Spotify will try to reach an agreement with Spoken Giants again, or if the comedians’ content will ever return. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746682/spotify-q3-2021-earnings-podcast-music-streaming-financials"&gt;Spotify expected to have over 400 million users&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year, the affected comedians may be missing out on massive amounts of visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Fortnite trailer reveals Spider-Man and a new island for Chapter 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tovuV8bRglAD53Ee0Hfv3nvecbo=/238x0:2635x1598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228889/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_11.50.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man appears to be coming to &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://streamable.com/3jtpmq" target="_blank"&gt;Streamable video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4jpqK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Chapter 2 comes to an end on Saturday, but a trailer for Chapter 3 has already leaked, reportedly from Epic Games’ Polish YouTube channel (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-3-trailer-leaks-revealing-spider-man-1848161056"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Based on &lt;a href="https://streamable.com/3jtpmq"&gt;the trailer,&lt;/a&gt; the next chapter is poised to be a significant update, adding a brand new island, new mechanics, and your friendly island Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fYa1gy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW FORTNITE CHAPTER 3 TRAILER LEAKED ONLY WATCH IF YOU WANT TO!! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteChapter3?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FortniteChapter3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/N0SBoJaF4I"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N0SBoJaF4I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GalaxyBoi ❄️ (@DaRealGalaxyBoi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaRealGalaxyBoi/status/1467063354745257985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spKmVP"&gt;The Chapter 3 island looks to have a lot of new areas to explore, including the Daily Bugle and a location reminiscent of the Aztec-themed Sunny Steps from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; first chapter. There appear to be new ways to get around, such as sliding down hills to get some extra speed and swinging from high places. And it seems you’ll be able to retrieve stashed weapons from previous matches using tents, which could add some extra strategy to playing a few rounds with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzeQF4"&gt;The leaked trailer shows some new playable characters joining the game, including Spider-Man (who looks to be available in the battle pass) and skins for Marcus Fenix and Kait Diaz from &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt;. Epic also appears to be adding The Foundation, a mysterious character from Chapter 2 who &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/fortnite-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-teases-his-role-as-the-foundation-in-new-energy-drink"&gt;might be played by Dwayne Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZu0fs"&gt;One thing the trailer doesn’t reveal is exactly when &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Chapter 3 will be available. The black hole downtime between chapters 1 and 2 lasted for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;nearly two days&lt;/a&gt; — hopefully, we don’t have to wait as long to swing onto the new island in Chapter 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53bnKL"&gt;If you want to watch the end-of-chapter event, you might want to log on soon, as it kicks off at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22799221/fortnite-chapter-2-end-date"&gt;4PM ET Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter reportedly suspended accounts by mistake after extremists abused new private media policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfC6_5lNHTJKQcUxm4WS-LFt9mw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228616/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woLOsv"&gt;Twitter has reportedly suspended a number of accounts by mistake after far-right extremists began exploiting the platform’s new private media policy, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-admits-error-in-account-suspensions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5oEoq"&gt;The platform has since launched an internal review of the matter and has made the necessary corrections, &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; notes. Twitter’s new policy, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809746/twitter-ban-personal-information-private-media-photo-videos-harassment"&gt;allows individuals to request takedowns of photos or videos&lt;/a&gt; that contain them, has become the target of far-right activists who seek to remove pictures of them taken at hate rallies. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465738076978774018"&gt;platform originally said&lt;/a&gt; that the rule was put in place to “curb the misuse of media to harass, intimate, and reveal the identities of private individuals,” which Twitter says disproportionately affects “women, activists, dissidents, and members of minority communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHrHpr"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/02/twitter-media-rule-used-by-extremists/"&gt;extremists began abusing Twitter’s new system&lt;/a&gt; shortly after it debuted. Far-right activists reportedly used services like Telegram and Gab to organize against anti-extremist accounts that work to expose and keep track of white supremacists at hate rallies — they sought to get these accounts suspended and have their personal photos removed (via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8ITie"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;URGENT: As we feared, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterSafety&lt;/a&gt; is already locking and suspending the accounts of extremism researchers under its new "Private Media" policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The video is from September (predating the policy) and shows two right-wing extremists IN PUBLIC, planning violent assaults. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dp7zlt1u4r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dp7zlt1u4r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chad Loder (they/them) (@chadloder) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1465831941157052416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FPiMMq"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; points out, some extremist researchers learned that their accounts had been suspended for violating the platform's rules “against posting media of an individual from a country with a recognized right to privacy law” the same day that Twitter launched the policy. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter spokesman Trenton Kennedy reportedly told the outlet that the company has been hit with a “significant amount” of wrongful reports, resulting in “a dozen erroneous suspensions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F7kpna"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So far, Twitter's new “private information policy” has disproportionately penalized working journalists and researchers of the far-right. Some have been locked out over photos they took at *public rallies.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this is the bar, we've all crossed it. &lt;br&gt;Fix this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterSafety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bRJtTqSjLc"&gt;https://t.co/bRJtTqSjLc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Campbell (@AndyBCampbell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBCampbell/status/1466887540745674755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxzTu6"&gt;Twitter has faced criticism over the vague wording of its new policy, specifically because of the ramifications it could have on journalists or other users who have a legitimate reason for posting others’ photos online. In a thread on the feature’s launch day, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1465738082292887554"&gt;Twitter said&lt;/a&gt; that it “will take into consideration whether the image is publicly available and/or is being covered by journalists,” and that “images/videos that show people participating in public events (like large scale protests, sporting events, etc.) would generally not violate this policy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywgLzo"&gt;It remains unclear if Twitter plans on taking steps to clarify this policy, and whether it will specifically outline what types of personal photos are and aren’t allowed on the platform. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Twitter with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ludwig’s livestream was interrupted by a copyright warning days after joining YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDebIKeFdsOfEX217bwtUVrhZEw=/208x0:2620x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228280/ludwig_youtube_suspended_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ludwig via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=API5Lt8t7Ho" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3oQbdo"&gt;Just three days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808873/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-subathon-youtube-gaming"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren left his massive Twitch following for YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, he was hit with what he thought was a suspension from the platform. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/former-twitch-subathon-star-ludwig-suspended-days-after-1848156400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ahgren was playing other YouTube videos during his stream, when he landed on the infamously catchy &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; song. His stream was shut down shortly thereafter, giving his viewers — and himself — the impression that he was banned for violating YouTube’s copyright policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LSzvcl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;you could say the switch has been going well... &lt;a href="https://t.co/dnkjSUkT0o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dnkjSUkT0o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ludwig (@LudwigAhgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1466576027858001928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzAuO"&gt;However, Ahgren wasn’t actually struck with a copyright strike or a suspension. “Ludwig wasn’t suspended,” Lauren Verrusio, the head of creator and consumer communications at YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our Content ID tool picked up his playing of an unlicensed video while he was going live to fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSufM1"&gt;The whole incident was just a case of confusion. “If Ludwig were to have just stopped playing the copyrighted material, he could have continued the livestream just fine,” Verrusio explained. “But he wasn’t sure of what he was seeing on the backend and thought it was a suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx7RrR"&gt;Ludwig addressed the incident in a video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDPKQb86Qw0"&gt;his secondary channel&lt;/a&gt;, in which he interprets the warning as a ban. “I’m pretty sure the corporate overlords who own &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; have, like, an iron fist on YouTube, and so they took me down.” Verrusio notes that YouTube is in touch with Ahgren to explain the platform’s copyright rules, and that Ludwig plans on going live again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on0k1Y"&gt;DMCA, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, has caused issues across all video sharing and livestreaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;with creators getting videos unknowingly taken down and demonetized&lt;/a&gt; for having copyrighted material. Earlier this year, Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335929/twitch-dmca-vod-mass-delete-copyright-strike-dmca"&gt;rolled out a tool&lt;/a&gt; that makes it easier to delete old videos that contain copyrighted music, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-wave-warning-notice"&gt;issued a wave of copyright strikes&lt;/a&gt; in response to DMCA complaints. Like Twitch, YouTube also operates with a three-strike policy — accrue three copyright violations and you’re permanently banned. To help soften DMCA’s blow, YouTube started telling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335728/youtube-checks-monetization-copyright-claim-dispute-tool"&gt;creators if their content contains copyrighted material&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; their videos are posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJkTE5"&gt;As Ludwig gets acquainted with his new streaming hub, his mistakes likely won’t go unnoticed. He currently has 2.19 million subscribers on YouTube, with more bound to trickle in from what’s left of his fanbase on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buy two Nintendo Switch games and get one free at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R1nc4AQVlNYnmJd0H9GbpL8v5uY=/222x0:840x412/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70227915/Screenshot_2021_12_03_144418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Buy two, get one free&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bLY7np"&gt;Best Buy is still hosting its mix-and-match sale featuring some excellent titles from the Nintendo Switch game library. Right now you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf77Eria2mK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a third game of equal or lesser value for free if you buy two other select titles&lt;/a&gt;. This offer includes first-party titles like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis: Aces&lt;/em&gt; that rarely see discounts. While this offer is limited to 11 titles, this is one of the best ways to stock up on games that are exclusive to the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TtZyEq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The next N64 game for Nintendo Switch Online is Paper Mario","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22815382/n64-switch-paper-mario-release-date-announced"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XSyRF2"&gt;While not quite as enticing as Black Friday prices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf77ITyjJM2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has discounted all models of the 11-inch iPad Pro that launched in 2020, with some versions receiving discounts of up to $200&lt;/a&gt;. This tablet is available with up to 1TB of built-in storage and comes with many of the same features you’ll find on the latest version, except the M1 processor. This includes USB-C charging, a 120Hz refresh rate display, and dual-lens rear cameras. However, if you’re in the market for something with a bit more screen real estate, Best Buy is offering similar discounts on 2020 model of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KNsYYC"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus is a quick and easy way to transform your iPad into a MacBook. Currently, Brydge is offering the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D31717947441257&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F4%2F22816014%2Fnintendo-switch-games-asus-zephyrus-gaming-laptop-apple-ipad-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch version of this combination screen protector and keyboard for $120&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D31717947408489&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F4%2F22816014%2Fnintendo-switch-games-asus-zephyrus-gaming-laptop-apple-ipad-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch for $130&lt;/a&gt;, taking $30 and $40 off the regular prices, respectively. This case is designed to closely emulate the classic look and feel of the backlit keyboard on the MacBook Pro and even includes a trackpad in its list of features. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam Byford noted in his review&lt;/a&gt; that the Brydge Pro Plus transforms the iPad Pro into a convenient laptop form factor, even though some of the gestures you can use on the Apple magic keyboard aren’t available here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Czgpgd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OvhcNP"&gt;Ponder having your own personal orb that you can talk to with this sweet discount on the latest Echo Dot. This version of the spherical speaker is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749437417640247273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $30, its lowest price ever. This omnidirectional speaker boasts all the functionality of previous Alexa-enabled speakers, just in a slightly more attractive form factor. It still features top-mounted touch controls, and is available in black, white, or blue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pDW4hB"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf77LBUaeWf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32-inch curved Asus TUF Gaming Monitor is currently discounted to just $290 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, taking $100 off the regular price. This monitor features a 165Hz refresh rate and  1440p resolution, as well as support for AMD FreeSync to help minimize screen tearing. This model features a pair of HDMI inputs as well as a DisplayPort jack, and a 3.5mm audio jack for headphones. The stand’s height, tilt, and swivel can be adjusted, but the monitor also supports VESA mount, if you’d prefer a wall-mounted or arm-based solution. This is one of the better prices we’ve seen for a monitor with these specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wISf2y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9739259"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R39XwA"&gt;The 15-inch Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop is still discounted to its Black Friday price. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf8e6fNlSML" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering this capable laptop for $1,900&lt;/a&gt;, knocking $300 off the regular retail price. This laptop comes equipped with a a QHD display, an RTX 3080, an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for storage. Like virtually all of the gaming laptops available at Best Buy, the G15 also comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, a perfect combo for playing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; on launch day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E293gW"&gt;Monica Chin was thoroughly impressed with the Zephyrus G15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/search?q=Asus+ROG+Zephyrus+G15" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in her review&lt;/a&gt; (though she tested the RTX 3070 model), and it even occupies the top spot for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;. Unless you absolutely need a built-in webcam, which this model lacks, the Zephyrus G15 is otherwise an excellent choice for your next gaming laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zu235T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10385239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZxPkWf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few more sweet deals for you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty made $3 billion in 2020, so of course Activision Blizzard is laying off QA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-z5N5MzDtg9qct8KVPvd_3pBgA=/0x0:1623x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70227150/WZP_S1_ANNOUNCEMENT_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ti08sJ"&gt;One of the studios responsible for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s success is laying off QA testers that are reportedly earning $17 an hour for their work on the franchise &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201204005140/en/"&gt;Activision Blizzard said&lt;/a&gt; brought in $3 billion dollars in 2020. Raven Software, known for its work on &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CoD: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; has now laid off a third of its contract QA testers, according to reports &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-qa-testers-face-layoffs-after-reportedly-b-1848159708"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/raven-software-layoffs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73PVfY"&gt;Raven’s Associate Community Manager Austin O’Brien said that team members were&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eyyohbee/status/1466890788235878409?s=20"&gt; being called into individual meetings&lt;/a&gt; to be told whether or not they would still have a job come January 28th. So far, the company has reportedly laid off about a third of its QA testers, or around a dozen people, but it’s possible more could follow&lt;em&gt;. The Post&lt;/em&gt; quotes an anonymous Raven contractor who said that “everyone was told, ‘you did nothing wrong,’ after being given the bad news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vqcsY"&gt;A Better ABK, an employee advocacy group, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1466937163845709827?s=20"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; many of the employees moved to Wisconsin for the job, without receiving assistance from Activision Blizzard. O’Brien also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eyyohbee/status/1466890788235878409?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company had been promising team members they would get raises after Activision (Raven’s owner) completed a pay restructure, and that may be coming true in a cruel way: &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-qa-testers-face-layoffs-after-reportedly-b-1848159708"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the workers who get to stay will receive a raise from $17 an hour to $18.50 an hour, along with better benefits and bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M5O9c9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These people were asked to relocate to Madison, WI to work here. Now they are out of a job on January 28th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our QA team does incredible work but this will not only increase their workload but crush morale. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If any industry friends have open positions, please share them.&lt;/p&gt;— Austin O'Brien (@eyyohbee) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eyyohbee/status/1466891349584715778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOzMep"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Jason Schreier &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466926920914903042"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that some testers he spoke to won’t know their status until next week, which likely means they’ll have to endure an uncomfortable weekend before they find out if they’ll have to spend the holidays job hunting. One QA tester for the studio &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/esheggeby/status/1466898804863651846?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that they wouldn’t know until Tuesday, and &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reported that the studio’s developers learned about the layoffs via word of mouth, instead of an official announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FBO8NC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I've been in touch with about half a dozen Raven testers tonight. The company is informing them individually whether or not they're being laid off. But some don't have their meetings scheduled until next week, so they head into the weekend not knowing if they still have jobs&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466926920914903042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Du0Fc1"&gt;Activision Blizzard has shown a pattern of laying off workers amidst booming business, as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; points out. In 2019, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222484/activision-blizzard-layoffs-cuts-jobs-record-results-2018"&gt;laid off around 8 percent of its employees&lt;/a&gt; after CEO Bobby Kotick announced that its 2018 financial results were the best in the company’s history. In June, Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-bobby-activision-ceo-kotick-pockets-a-cool-dollar155-million/"&gt;reportedly received $155 million dollars&lt;/a&gt; after a shareholder vote — a few months before that, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334569/activision-blizzard-layoffs-esports-overwatch-call-of-duty-league-covid-pandemic"&gt;laid off around 50 employees that managed events&lt;/a&gt;, giving them three month’s severance and $200 Battle.net gift cards. &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-14-call-of-duty-launch-sales-down-40-percent-year-on-year-uk-charts"&gt;Gamesindustry.biz reports&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, a game made by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision, was the second largest game launch in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSercY"&gt;Activision Blizzard has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;recently been in the spotlight&lt;/a&gt; for having terrible work conditions and for not acting on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;repeated claims of abuse and sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; from employees. There are also allegations that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;Kotick knew about the issues for years and had his own history of harassment&lt;/a&gt;. In less than a week, the company is set to release an expansion to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; that ties into &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLmwPw"&gt;Activision didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s the last Bandcamp Friday of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The BandCamp application seen displayed on a Apple MacBook..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ym5M2TutxakqsOFGE2eGW5NGETA=/974x0:5000x2684/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70226755/962083828.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IhuPzR"&gt;In March 2020, &lt;a href="https://bandcamp.com/"&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188143/bandcamp-waives-sales-fees-artists-affected-coronavirus-pandemic'"&gt;started a promotion&lt;/a&gt; where it would forego taking a revenue share from sales artists made on its platform, providing some additional support to performers with suddenly limited opportunities due to the coronavirus pandemic. The arrangement turned into a monthly event, as Bandcamp Fridays encouraged fans to keep the support coming by purchasing audio tracks and merchandise over the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cr7xs"&gt;Bandcamp pledged to keep things going throughout 2021 and has dutifully turned off its cut on the first Friday of each month. The only question left is, what happens next? The note about Bandcamp Friday sticking around for 2021 is no longer included on &lt;a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-2021"&gt;the blog post announcing the promotion&lt;/a&gt;, and no one has updated customers or creators about the plan for 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77nHlx"&gt;We have vaccines, and shows are playing again, but the pandemic isn’t quite over yet, and I know I’ve gotten used to having a day where I can tell myself it’s OK to buy an extra album or two because it’s just the right thing to do. It’s also provided some extra incentive for artists to tell their fans about Bandcamp as an alternative to streaming over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;Spotify or other music services that have fancy year-end graphics&lt;/a&gt; but don’t share as much of the money with the people who create what you’re listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fbaRO5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Music’s terrible year in review is giving me serious Spotify Wrapped FOMO ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="kkGKoB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s still Bandcamp Friday.&lt;/p&gt;— bandcamp (@Bandcamp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bandcamp/status/1466905282215391236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GofwY0"&gt;When Bandcamp Fridays launched, co-founder and CEO Ethan Diamond said, “For many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not.” Bandcamp says that over 800,000 fans have participated, paying over $61 million to artists and labels over the 15 days. It says that on average, 93 percent of your money reaches artists and labels when the promotion is active and, again on average, 82 percent when it isn’t, so there’s still plenty of reasons to show some appreciation with a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7ONtN"&gt;But at least for a few more hours (until 12AM PT on December 4th), yes, it is Bandcamp Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV’s nifty new personalized profiles have been delayed  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYKC8zfgqLI1ARIyc55AGYY7h48=/66x0:782x477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70226747/image004__3_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="535AB1"&gt;The individual user profiles that were expected to arrive on Google TV last month have been delayed, meaning those personalized content recommendations are unfortunately on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zpaxr"&gt;The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22716932/google-tv-profiles-watchlist-ambient-mode-philo"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; the new user profiles would arrive on Google TV last month, but Google spokesperson Ivy Hunt tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that the profiles will now begin rolling out “in the coming months.” News of the delay was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/03/google-tv-profiles-delay/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kuAeF"&gt;That’s a bit of a bummer for multi-user households who were looking forward to profile features like customized watchlists, personalized help from Google Assistant, and weeding out the content interests of others using the same device (e.g., roommates, kids, etc. — although Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318824/google-tv-kid-profiles-announced-features-parental-controls"&gt;previously introduced&lt;/a&gt; kids’ profiles earlier this year). Having to share a single experience among multiple users is a bit like handing over your Netflix algorithm. Not ideal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfMS4L"&gt;Google didn’t offer a reason for the delay, but with any mercy, its TV experience will bring us personalized user profiles early into the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
