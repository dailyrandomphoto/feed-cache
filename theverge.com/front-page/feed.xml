    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The best phone of 2021: iPhone 13, Pixel 6, iPhone 13 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 13 Mini, Pixel 5A, and Samsusng Galaxy Z Fold 3." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QthQgLW_qoVuV8_gEhvnwYZf3x4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_Fall_2021.12.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="k1bPmC"&gt;Due to a confluence of factors in 2021 — from production delays thanks to the ongoing pandemic, rising costs of labor and components, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; — prices for flagship phones have been higher than ever. The absolutely premium phones, like the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, now cost well over $1,000, or about the price of a good laptop. Even if you’re willing to shell out top dollar for the best smartphone of 2021, it’ll take lots of luck and patience to get one into your hands this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxr7Qk"&gt;Thankfully, you no longer have to spend a huge amount to get something amazing, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $600 to 800 this year. In fact, if you like Android, the best phone for your buck this holiday season is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$599 Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. For everyone else, our pick for the best overall phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;$829 Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ugNMR"&gt;And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even less. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I7S1w"&gt;A great smartphone should last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. After all, upgrade cycles are slowing down: people are holding onto their phones for longer, so they’re looking for features that will last a few years. Believe it or not, most top phones are pretty neck and neck in terms of their user experience and features these days — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 can do it all: it hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="63WdF8"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meCBEI"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2xAh9b"&gt;Out of the four iPhone 13 variants that Apple launched in 2021, the $829 iPhone 13 (unlocked) hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWggHi"&gt;It has a new processor, a bigger battery, 128GB of internal storage, and uses the same large camera sensor as the acclaimed iPhone 12 Pro Max, but you wouldn’t know it from its compact size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtOjH2"&gt;In fact, the 13 looks almost identical to the 12 but is just a bit thicker and heavier, with substantially bigger camera bumps and lenses that swapped places. (No, you won’t be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for the 13.) Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same 12-megapixel selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. On top of all that, it comes in five colors (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfcR8W"&gt;What’s different with the iPhone 13’s new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years to come, but it’s difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones. The new chip helps the iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZlh8X"&gt;Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and videos in 2020, the iPhone 13’s main wide-angle camera has &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyZ2NJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzMqAW"&gt;significantly improved. Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been minorly updated for better low-light performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwNczv"&gt;Video quality is also great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super well. It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between subjects by changing the depth of field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymvwy3"&gt;The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage. Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on how you’ll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 (right) is Google’s first flagship phone, and it’s already right up there with the best from Apple and Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1IUao"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5xQzeU"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HijJkz"&gt;The Pixel 6 is a lot of phone for $599. As Google’s first true flagship phone since 2019, the Pixel 6 gets many things right and is right up there with the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in camera quality, overall performance, and battery life. When you consider the fact the Pixel 6 is a good $200 less than its rivals, it’s simply the most value-packed flagship phone for Android fans this year. Sorry, OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKm2Sq"&gt;You can tell the Pixel 6 from the Pixel 6 Pro by its slightly smaller 6.4-inch, 1080p OLED flat display and bolder color choices like two-tone red or green (black is also an option). For a relatively big phone, the Pixel 6 is not too thick yet feels substantial. That said, its glossy body is super slippery, so you’ll need to budget for a third-party case (forget the Google ones, they aren’t worth the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j9tZm"&gt;At the heart of the Pixel 6 is Tensor, Google’s first proprietary mobile processor that is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip inside other Android flagships. Tensor allows the new Pixel to lean into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to learn some new tricks. You can use the Magic Eraser to remove photo-bombers from your photos, take &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fUDR1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s simply the most value packed flagship phone for Android fans this year.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2QbW6"&gt;photos that better reflect real skin tones, as well as use Google Assistant to handle automated calls for you. The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, and runs the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12 software&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s new Material You theming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmSNYb"&gt;Inside its sizable rear camera bar are dual cameras, 50-megapixel wide and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras, along with a laser detection autofocus sensor for low-light and depth. Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the 6 doesn’t have a telephoto camera. Still, its images are very good in both normal and low light and very competitive with the best from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 4,614mAh battery (should last two days for light users), supports Qi wireless charging, and has some protection from rain storms (IP68). Its main weakness is a slow under-screen fingerprint scanner, and the phone lacks a face unlock option. While not perfect, the Pixel 6 is an all-around good phone for $599 and is our pick for the best Android phone to buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IyREhz"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same camera system, so either Pro models will be good for content creation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ovaxxT"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dctrOj"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BudYKV"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year, and they are our pick as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;iPhone for photos and videos. This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with either of the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CewoNz"&gt;The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, particularly in low light. If photo and video quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYma8C"&gt;The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main 12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or challenging lighting conditions. Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to its new close focus capability. In addition, the 3x optical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKFScJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jxI2pw"&gt;zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great portrait photography. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization make for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light. You can even shoot and edit videos directly in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832"&gt;ProRes&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;For those looking for the best Android camera system available, we recommend getting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$899 Google Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, especially if a telephoto lens is a must. We pitted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro cameras in a comparison video&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are pretty evenly split. While the Pixel 6 Pro’s video capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro’s. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini has all the same cameras and features as its siblings but packs a smaller battery for light users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fEdsxM"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fRQPIp"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yu67SC"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 13 Mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 13 Mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALR5kS"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the Mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OR8NaU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLWG16"&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery that probably won’t last a power user through a whole day without a charge. It’s really designed for a lighter user who isn’t glued to the phone all day. Otherwise, the Mini is the same phone as the iPhone 13: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 13 Mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a built-in S Pen and a battery that can last two days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGzRrM"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="osyeHY"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium phone with a stylus and amazing battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the one for you. Because this device originally launched in 2020, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;rumors that Samsung will be discontinuing the series in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczza1"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant 6.9-inch OLED display is 4K in resolution and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM, so it can perform without a hiccup. Together, these elements make the S Pen sing by cutting down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G41prk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOPhPE"&gt;the latency between inking and what you see on-screen. While its triple rear camera system is not as good as the iPhone 13 Pro’s, it’s still one of the most advanced you can get. With its 4,500mAh battery, you can expect about two days of use before you’ll need a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;Although you can technically use the S Pen with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it isn’t built into the phone like it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. If you want your S Pen and phone in one clean color-coordinated package, you’ll need to get the Note 20 Ultra while it’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the perks of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is its 1.9-inch exterior screen for widgets and notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PoZM83"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kSVtiN"&gt;Best flip phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PDkqPQ"&gt;Sick of smartphones that only get bigger and heavier when all you want is for some new ways to use your phone? Samsung’s third go at a flip phone seems to strike the right balance of whimsy, technical prowess and price that make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 appealing to mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdAmnF"&gt;For $999.99, this 4.2-inch pocketable device can transform into a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display that is bright and has a fast 120Hz refresh rate. The screen can also be used as a split screen for multitasking. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch outer second screen, which displays handy widgets like app notifications and audio player controls without making you open the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="77t8Vy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcXpK"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as any other flagship phone released in 2021. Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screen time between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLTJff"&gt;It’s too bad its dual cameras did not get an upgrade from the previous iteration. Both the 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, as well as the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, take good but not great photos. Due to the Z Flip 3’s form factor, it can double as a mobile tripod for the cameras, which makes for some fun new ways to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,400 Motorola Razr (2020&lt;/a&gt;), the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone. It’s hard to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;how durable this foldable screen&lt;/a&gt; will be, but at least you can be among the first to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZtA5cf"&gt;Best phone under $300 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8vynA"&gt;Not everyone needs a premium flagship phone, and even a budget phone can be a delight to use these days. If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S will defy your expectations for what a budget should look and feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI5uYL"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional security option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xa3xoR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WI8Y8C"&gt;While the 20S’s camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1ZKhC"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even a $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, good battery life, for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A will receive three years of OS and security updates from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R9fmdS"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r9nZkH"&gt;Best Android phone under $500 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nicCXJ"&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album: those who are in the know love it, but most casual Android users may not even know it exists. It’s only available from Google’s online store because carriers don’t carry the Pixel 5A, but it’s worth the effort to get this hidden gem of a $450 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62kYmA"&gt;The Pixel 5A has made some key upgrades from the discontinued Pixel 5: its screen is now a bit bigger at 6.3 inches, it has a slightly bigger battery at 4,680mAh, and it provides some dust and water protection (IP67). Otherwise, it has the same beloved camera sensor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, 6GB RAM, as well as 5G connectivity (sub-6GHz 5G). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="DFlWgw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xRhhw"&gt;Like its predecessors, the Pixel 5A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with flagships that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually a few years old now. It means the Pixel 5A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the benefits of getting a Pixel is that it’ll be first in line for the latest Android updates. Google has committed to providing three years of OS and security updates to the 5A. Android 12 is already available for it, and it will be one of the first models to get the next version after that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third time’s the charm for the $1,800 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it’s still too expensive for most.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xBwOAb"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PiiTyN"&gt;Best folding phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fWZzLE"&gt;If you’ve been waiting patiently for the foldable phone to mature before dropping some serious coin for one, this might be the year to get the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738082/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-folding-phone-dual-screen-multitasking"&gt;Microsoft’s dual-screen Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; is a distant second to the Fold 3, in this early two-device race.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ADSUM"&gt;The Fold 3 is Samsung’s third-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a skinny smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WScnfM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cJXDD"&gt;browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone. It also has an extra 6.2-inch screen on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution, so you can use it for quick tasks when you don’t have enough time or space to unfold the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WmHwM"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 3 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, all its cameras are sub-par, and its 4,400mAh battery is a bit small to power so many screens. While the Fold 3 is water resistant (IPX8), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;durability of its foldable screen and hinge&lt;/a&gt; remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 3 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. At $1,800, you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half. If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 3 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rsSZIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO6Eoz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the Xbox 20th anniversary event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1CRDSyaqECl1YlFfhYW7-4KPAzQ=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143735/xbox_anniversary_event_savethedate_3840x2160.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GaBzky"&gt;Microsoft is holding a special Xbox anniversary event today to celebrate 20 years to the day since the original Xbox debuted alongside &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. “While we won’t announce any new games, this broadcast will be a special look back at all the memories we’ve shared with the Xbox community over the past two decades,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynVM2A"&gt;While the event is designed as a celebration rather than a news event, that doesn’t mean there won’t be news. Rumors suggest we may well see an early beta of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer to mark 20 years of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and plenty of Xbox fans have spotted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1458932415439593474"&gt;suspicious updates&lt;/a&gt; to existing original Xbox and Xbox 360 games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvR9zz"&gt;We’re expecting the event to run for around 30 minutes in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR1IjE"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE XBOX 20th ANNIVERSARY EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the livestream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET on Monday, November 15th. If you miss the livestream, you’ll be able to catch a replay after the event wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH IT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rJG3mU"&gt;Microsoft is hosting the stream on Xbox’s official &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; channels and its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/xbox/"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. The YouTube stream is embedded above for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft blocks EdgeDeflector to force Windows 11 users into Edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jIbGHDIr-9FROnY5LPK1YPpybk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143561/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3NJz7"&gt;Microsoft has already made it more difficult to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;switch default browsers in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company is going a step further by blocking apps like EdgeDeflector. Third-party apps like EdgeDeflector and even Firefox have offered workarounds to Microsoft forcing people to use Edge in Start menu search results, even if their default browser is not Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GF5MZ"&gt;Microsoft has been forcing Windows 10 and Windows 11 users into Edge and its Bing search engine in the Start menu search results, and now with the new Widgets panel in Windows 11. It’s a frustrating part of Windows that doesn’t respect your default browser choice. EdgeDeflector lets you bypass these restrictions, and open Start menu search results in your default browser of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5alTy"&gt;The EdgeDeflector block first appeared in an early preview build of Windows 11 last week. While the block initially looked like a bug, Microsoft has now confirmed the changes will arrive for all Windows 11 users in a software update that’s arriving in the coming weeks. Microsoft has decided to prevent app developers from invoking &lt;em&gt;microsoft-edge&lt;/em&gt; protocol links, which are now restricted to the Edge browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KTFns9uTRYxamL4Apxllkq4IOQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015540/windows11defaults.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 makes it harder to set default apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sKIzLw"&gt;“Windows openly enables applications and services on its platform, including various web browsers,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “At the same time, Windows also offers certain end-to-end customer experiences in both Windows 10 and Windows 11, the search experience from the taskbar is one such example of an end-to-end experience that is not designed to be redirected. When we become aware of improper redirection, we issue a fix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir3QOt"&gt;This “fix” is now part of an upcoming &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/12/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-346-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;imminent update to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; that arrived for Beta and Release Preview users late on Friday, and the developer of EdgeDeflector isn’t happy with Microsoft’s changes. “These aren’t the actions of an attentive company that cares about its product anymore,” &lt;a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/microsoft-edge-protocol-competition.html"&gt;says Daniel Aleksandersen&lt;/a&gt;, developer of EdgeDeflector, in a critical blog post last week. “Microsoft isn’t a good steward of the Windows operating system. They’re prioritizing ads, bundleware, and service subscriptions over their users’ productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zzrYkX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"},{"title":"Mozilla has defeated Microsoft’s default browser protections in Windows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671182/mozilla-default-browser-windows-protections-firefox"},{"title":"Mozilla’s Firefox browser arrives in the Windows store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771845/mozilla-firefox-microsoft-store-windows-download"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VBV6ty"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t explained why it has suddenly started to block EdgeDeflector and other apps, but it’s very clear why. “The 500,000 EdgeDeflector users were probably never more than a nuisance to Microsoft,” explains Aleksandersen. “However, last month both the Brave and Firefox web browsers &lt;a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/anti-competitive-browser-edges.html"&gt;either copied EdgeDeflector’s functionality&lt;/a&gt; or signaled it was on the roadmap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tp2fAe"&gt;Firefox has 200 million users, so that’s likely to have caught Microsoft’s attention and lead them to patch this workaround. Mozilla isn’t impressed with Microsoft’s block here, either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwtIGJAi6Ju8Jz35JiMyYASqZXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015541/1PwQMSA.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox in the Microsoft Store doesn’t include default browser workarounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SlNYVp"&gt;“People deserve choice. They should have the ability to simply and easily set defaults and their choice of default browser should be respected,” says a Mozilla spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have worked on code that launches Firefox when the microsoft-edge protocol is used for those users that have already chosen Firefox as their default browser. Following the recent change to Windows 11, this planned implementation will no longer be possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCfoF9"&gt;Mozilla also implemented its own workaround to quickly and easily set Firefox as the default browser on Windows 10 and Windows 11 in a single click. It’s a feature that Microsoft limits to its Edge browser. While Mozilla’s workaround is available in the version of Firefox you download from the web, if you download &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771845/mozilla-firefox-microsoft-store-windows-download"&gt;Firefox from the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; then the default browser workaround is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRziqp"&gt;“Firefox ships an MSIX package in the Windows Store so that our users on Windows 10 and Windows 11 are able to download Firefox from the Store,” explains a Mozilla spokesperson. “MSIX packages run in a ‘Windows package environment.’ The aspects of the Windows environment that Firefox relies on when users choose Firefox to be their default browser do not work in a MSIX environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ673E"&gt;Microsoft’s changes here are gross, particularly the Windows 11 ones that make it more difficult to switch default browsers in the first place. It’s an aggressive strategy that reminds me of the ugly antitrust battle for bundling Internet Explorer in Windows. Microsoft also faced multiple fines in Europe over its anti-competitive Internet Explorer bundling, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/6/4069126/eu-fines-microsoft-for-windows-7-sp1-browser-ballot"&gt;$730 million fine for breaking a 2009 antitrust agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9mGcU"&gt;The strangest part of Microsoft forcing people to use Edge and ignoring browser defaults in Windows is that Microsoft Edge is a good browser. Microsoft shouldn’t need to force you into using it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ Nord 2 Pac-Man Edition pays tribute to the arcade classic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUf0nxAEZkWgxBQUdFeIdLFAwcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143278/jporter_211111_4874_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are eight Pac-Man-themed wallpapers installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYJOef"&gt;OnePlus has announced a special Pac-Man Edition of the Nord 2. It’s a new version of the company’s latest mid-range smartphone with design tweaks inspired by the classic ‘80s arcade game. But underneath the new theme this is fundamentally the same hardware as the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; released in July this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOaPFL"&gt;The Pac-Man enhancements made to the phone are mostly cosmetic. Its back has a small Pac-Man logo on it and glows in the dark to reveal a Pac-Man maze, and there’s also a semi-translucent themed case featuring the titular character alongside ghostly antagonists Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. Boot up the phone and you’re presented with a dynamic Pac-Man-themed wallpaper, one of eight in total. There’s a Pac-Man themed charging animation, and other 8-bit-style touches include redesigned icons for OnePlus’ stock apps and retro notification alert sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJy2OAWbleYMN0gKDAxkeh_rYY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007013/jporter_211111_4874_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_7l1HI8IRhD_ZWw3pKUeHR-apg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007019/jporter_211111_4874_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63qdarShk-0knxf1YblIEQ9ZbjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007018/jporter_211111_4874_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m5oT1yl1Z9ura_uuh5jL02Yrcgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007014/jporter_211111_4874_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s also a Pac-Man-themed case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="si9nzF"&gt;If you order the phone directly from OnePlus, you also get a Pac-Man-themed stand which you build yourself out of Lego-style building blocks. Oh, and there’s also a Pac-Man game that comes pre-installed on the phone: 2015’s free-to-play &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 256. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouWO5k"&gt;Otherwise, in terms of hardware the Pac-Man Edition is the same as the original Nord 2. That means it’s got a 6.43-inch 1080p 90Hz OLED display, is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI processor, and has a 4,500mAh battery which can be fast-charged at 65W. There are three cameras on the back: a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel monochrome camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Snv7A"&gt;OnePlus is of course no stranger to co-branding its devices, having previously worked with brands including McLaren with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18135063/oneplus-6t-mclaren-edition-specs-price-announcement-warp-charge"&gt;OnePlus 6T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/10/20906256/oneplus-7t-pro-release-date-price-news-features-pop-up-selfie-camera-90hz-screen"&gt;7T Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732353/oneplus-harry-potter-limited-edition-smartwatch-watch-faces"&gt;Harry Potter for a recent India-exclusive watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0OXzH"&gt;The Pac-Man edition of the phone is available with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and will cost £499 (€529 / ₹37,999) in the UK, Europe, and India when it goes on sale on November 16th. That’s a small premium over the £469 / €499 / ₹34,999 OnePlus charges for the non-Pac-Man Nord 2 with the same specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeVVQb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylvrdU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung releases Android 12-powered One UI 4 for Galaxy S21 phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwf6FBj-SQLfnJEJcWEABooTDMU=/0x0:1377x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143277/image5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One UI 4 includes redesigned widgets.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sz6dsU"&gt;Samsung is making its One UI 4 software update available for the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra starting today, the company has announced. The update is based on this year’s Android 12, was released in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672780/samsung-android-12-beta-galaxy-s21"&gt;public beta in September&lt;/a&gt;, and adds new theming options, keyboard tweaks, and privacy settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Og4k"&gt;The new features coming with the latest version of Samsung’s software should look familiar to anyone who’s been keeping up with Android 12’s upgrades. First up is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Material You-style&lt;/a&gt; overhaul, including the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/all-samsung-stock-apps-with-material-you-design-one-ui-4-0/"&gt;change the operating system’s color scheme&lt;/a&gt; based on your chosen wallpaper, and there are also redesigned widgets. New privacy-focused features include a Privacy Dashboard that keeps track of how often apps are requesting sensitive information from your phone, and there are also new indicators that show when the phone’s camera or microphone are in use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_X1Bk9yT2FmtEtgk4STYdqS5-Ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015468/image2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Privacy Dashboard shows how often apps are requesting sensitive info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="pHicdw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vJwjLz"&gt;Other new features include a tweaked keyboard that offers more animated emoji and stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1Iwfv"&gt;Although the One UI 4 update is currently limited to Samsung’s S21 series, the company says it’ll be available “soon” on a range of its other devices including older Galaxy S, Galaxy Note, and Galaxy A devices, as well as Samsung’s foldables, and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pS7BRK"&gt;Although its press release doesn’t give an official timeframe for the update’s release on these phones, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrontTron/status/1460132525657845761"&gt;notice that appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the Samsung Members app in Korea earlier today gives a better idea of timings. According to this notice, which was deleted shortly after being posted, the Z Flip 3, Z Fold 3, S20 series, Note 20 series, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip 5G could receive their One UI 4 updates in December. Older foldables, as well as Note 10 and S10 devices appear likely to follow in January, while Samsung’s tablets could start receiving the update from February, starting with the Tab S7 and S7 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1X7bsU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uV4xZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop has heart, style, and some rough edges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpf4i9VLCjwdhRW37IBwsZ8IziA=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143160/COWBOYBEB_Unit_08114RC4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Two perspectives on the live-action series&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="udRy8j"&gt;Netflix’s live-action take on &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; comes with a lot of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPn8a5"&gt;Much of those come from the existing fans, of course — those who loved the original anime with its jazz- and corgi-infused mix of noir and sci-fi and are hoping the new series does it justice. Then there are those coming to the show without existing expectations, who are just looking for some great space capers. On top of this, Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is also the latest in a growing list of attempts at turning classic anime into live-action shows or movies. For the most part, these have been an unqualified disaster, whether it’s the Americanized &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; movie or M. Night Shyamalan’s forgettable take on &lt;em&gt;The Last Airbender.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Z9lz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, though, has offered glimpses of hope in the lead-up to its debut. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691323/cowboy-bebop-netflix-opening-title-sequence-watch"&gt;the painfully stylish opening credits sequence&lt;/a&gt;, a promising cast featuring the likes of Daniella Pineda, John Cho, and John Cho’s hair, and the all-important news that Yoko Kanno would return to compose the main theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnZ2D6"&gt;To figure out whether or not the series will satisfy any of these audiences, we enlisted long-time &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; fan Ash Parrish and newcomer Andrew Webster to binge all 10 episodes and report back. Let’s go, space cowboys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="jI7aw2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULCIHP5dc44?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft9kL2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I have to admit, the show didn’t grab me at first, which was surprising. It has a lot of things I love: great music; a retrofuturistic world; elements of noir, westerns, and even a hint of samurai movies; and characters defined by mystery. The Netflix series is centered on a trio of bounty hunters — called cowboys, in this universe — who form an uneasy alliance. There’s Spike (Cho), the prototypical badass with a dark and mysterious past. Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir), his self-serious partner who used to be a cop and is trying his best to be a good dad. Soon enough, they’re joined by Faye Valentine (Pineda), an amnesiac looking to find out who she really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EaMZc"&gt;It’s a great setup, but something about it felt… off, at least early on. Some of it was the aesthetics — Jet’s strange beard that’s obviously a wig or Spike’s odd-fitting suit. The action felt stiff, and the CG looked cheap. Meanwhile, everyone behaved like a flat caricature in the early episodes. It seemed like the show expected me to already know and understand these characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYt93m"&gt;But things changed the more time I spent with them. The highlight of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; for me has been the found-family dynamic between Jet, Faye, and Spike. The way Jet can’t help but be a dad, taking everyone out for bowling and forcing them to have fun, or how Spike &lt;em&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to do the right thing but keeps getting caught up in his old life. I went from not caring about these characters to tearing up when Faye finally gets the smallest hint about her past. It took some time and looking past some of the show’s rough edges, but I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOhje7"&gt;Ash, what was it like coming to this from the anime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49YLRu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash: &lt;/strong&gt;I felt what you felt initially. &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; was such a formative experience for me as a teenager covertly watching the anime long after my appointed bedtime. I can definitively state that I wouldn’t become the person I am now without this show. Its aesthetic, from the noir-style storytelling to its jazzy soundtrack, became the foundation from which most of my taste, style, and ambitions come. But instead of recoiling with horror when the show was announced, which is understandable whenever an anime gets life action-ified, I was cautiously optimistic. If the show failed, at least I’d get new Yoko Kanno music. If the show succeeded, I’d finally have an anime adaptation worth a damn, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I’d get new Yoko Kanno music. I couldn’t lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUpevs"&gt;But my cautious optimism deflated after the first two episodes. I already didn’t like that the opening credits was a shot-for-shot reproduction of the anime’s credits, and the first episodes looked amateurish — like Netflix was putting on a &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; community theater performance rather than an ostensibly million-dollar production. It wasn’t any of the actors’ fault; I just felt they were doing their best with less than stellar dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OGy5c"&gt;John Cho (and his hair) can do no wrong, and he perfectly embodies the kind of nonchalant, wiseass I know Spike Spiegel to be. You’d be forgiven if you heard Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black and thought you were listening to Beau Billingslea from the anime dub. Pineda’s Faye was the breakout character, though. She’s not the Faye Valentine I knew but a better one, updated for modern audience sensibilities. She’s funnier than her anime counterpart, and her sexiness is transformed to make her feel more competent and less like an object to ogle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLu3h5"&gt;Faye’s transformation is the first evidence of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; being a faithful representation of the spirit of the show and not a simple recreation to the letter. A lot of characters got refreshing updates that translate better to a 2021 live-action show than a straight copy / paste from a 1996 anime would. In particular, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; the anime wasn’t particularly nice to queer characters, framing them as jokes to ridicule or tricksters to be repulsed by. Gren, from the two Jupiter Jazz episodes, was a man who became intersex after he was experimented on in prison. There’s a particularly nasty exchange when Faye catches him naked in the shower and asks, “What are you?” in a disgusted and alarmed tone. Live-action Gren, played by non-binary actor &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4317622/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t15"&gt;Mason Alexander Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;retains their&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;same&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;gender queerness but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;suffers none of the same queerphobia and is instead an integral member of the cast (while also being the best dressed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msaUBL"&gt;When the story failed for me early on, the characters kept me hooked. So we’ve talked about the cast a lot, but what did you think of the world of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHhwRsOsHxTGOeyuA_sXnMNexMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006593/COWBOYBEB_Unit_02503RC.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kirsty Griffin / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/15ue01vY5G6LMvF8mK1x_hIpdSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006599/COWBOYBEB_ArtDept_00543R2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2yjXZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t understand how they made this universe work. There’s so much going on, all pulled from so many very obvious inspirations, and yet it feels cohesive. We’ve seen shows like &lt;em&gt;Firefly&lt;/em&gt; struggle to pull this off, for instance; the Western and sci-fi elements of that show worked together, while the attempt to add aspects of Chinese culture seemed forced. But here, everything feels seamless. When the main villain, Vicious (played by a wonderfully menacing and maniacal Alex Hassell) wields a katana, it doesn’t feel out of place, even if he’s a blonde with an English accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5WdKt"&gt;I think the reason for this is the sheer attention to detail in the worldbuilding. The universe feels like a real, lived-in place with history. You can see it in the grim, dirty streets of New Tijuana or the old Macintosh computers and pager-like cellphones everyone has. (Between &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;it’s been a good year for retro hardware&lt;/a&gt;.) The Bebop itself looks like a beat-up space truck on the outside and a dorm room on the inside. You can see various cultures on display everywhere: Jet relaxes with a bonsai garden, listens to Coltrane, keeps a stash of Jamaican rum, and is always on the lookout for new dumpling recipes. I also loved some of the more offbeat worldbuilding elements, like the goofy infomercial-style show that cowboys watch to stay up to date on new bounties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6ki54"&gt;The only thing that lets it down is the uneven CG work. The sets, props, and costumes in &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop &lt;/em&gt;are almost uniformly good (I even warmed to Spike’s suit), but the various effects mostly looked cheap and out of place. This is especially true for just about every scene that takes place in outer space. It goes from a gritty noir western to a made-for-TV sci-fi movie very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKfqkR"&gt;Still, though, there’s something undeniably stylish about it, even when the show’s reach sometimes extends beyond its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKOoLQ"&gt;Now about that music...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMVQ8W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash:&lt;/strong&gt; Did someone mention &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; music?! When this project was first announced, I remember stating loudly in all caps that this endeavor would unequivocally fail without Yoko Kanno’s music. If she declined to participate or the show’s producers neglected to consider her involvement, then the project should cease, full-stop, because &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; without its music. The soundtrack, produced by Kanno and performed by her jazz band The Seatbelts, is &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s sixth man. The music is integral to &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s defining moments; Spike walking up to the church in “The Ballad of Fallen Angels” just does not have the same impact without the blaring organ of “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/6GB3_O9-iEw"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt;” accompanying him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTSbNL"&gt;I was happy, jazzed if you will, to hear my favorite songs in the world remixed and repurposed for a new show. I broke into the biggest grin when Spike appeared for the first time and “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MduJjbcLSqE"&gt;Spokey Dokey&lt;/a&gt;” was playing on his headphones. One of my biggest concerns early on was that the new &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; would be a shot-for-shot recreation of the anime. I’m so glad it’s not that at all, but there’s a moment that I won’t spoil when the show is a shot-for-shot recreation down to the music, and it works so perfectly that I stood up and hollered. In that moment, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; understood its assignment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTHdxM"&gt;I wish the show dug out some of its less well-known tracks like “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FAgYC89I73Y"&gt;Want It All Back&lt;/a&gt;” — which would have made a great chase sequence song — instead of relying on old standards. I’m also mightily annoyed that I didn’t hear “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YA4P1A3jtu0"&gt;What Planet Is This&lt;/a&gt;” once during the whole show. Missed opportunity. There’s one new song that shows up in the penultimate episode that oozes Kanno. I heard its moody, synthy vibes and instantly recognized Kanno at her best. It will be a crime of the highest order if Netflix doesn’t release the soundtrack. Better yet, a Netflix-sponsored The Seatbelts North American tour. A girl can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAZ7Yb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: The best thing I can say about the show is this: despite the occasionally stilted action, goofy wigs, and uneven CG, it has finally convinced me to binge the anime. It only took 23 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="w7ArVO"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cowboy Bebop &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;starts streaming on Netflix on November 19th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about how Amazon tries to evade responsibility in delivery vehicle crashes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ReGLnf4GWtuNxNoByKgoMzSsID4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70142050/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLQpW9"&gt;Amazon’s fleet of delivery drivers may be detached from Amazon warehouses, but the company still monitors its drivers; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;installed always-on cameras in its delivery trucks&lt;/a&gt; and even asked drivers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347945/amazon-delivery-drivers-ai-surveillance-cameras-vans-consent-form"&gt;consent to yawn-detecting AI surveillance&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s that very surveillance system that puts Amazon in the crosshairs of a lawsuit that claims Amazon is at fault for a life-altering car accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6MC0a"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-12/amazon-com-algorithms-blamed-in-crash-that-paralyzed-aspiring-doctor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report describes the details of the accident, as well as how one lawsuit may change the way legal teams approach similar situations in the future. The accident happened earlier this year, when 24-year-old Ans Rana was riding in the backseat of a Tesla Model S on a bustling Atlanta highway. After the car came to a stop behind a disabled vehicle, an Amazon delivery vehicle slammed into the back of the Tesla, leaving Rana with major brain and spinal-cord injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sityiZ"&gt;Rana filed a lawsuit against Amazon in June, claiming that Amazon is responsible for the accident. But as the report notes, Amazon says it can’t be held accountable due to the fact that the delivery driver technically wasn’t an employee of Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDg0sd"&gt;The delivery driver actually worked for Harper Logistics, LLC, one of the many Delivery Service Partners that Amazon uses for shipping. The Delivery Service Partners program was rolled out in 2018, and according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon’s partners employ over 260,000 drivers globally, some of who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423560/amazon-delivery-drivers-unsafe-reckless-driving-monitoring-app"&gt;claim that their employers tell them to turn off their safety apps&lt;/a&gt; to meet quotas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xstcKI"&gt;That’s why Rana’s lawsuit cruxes on Amazon’s algorithms, apps, and devices that Amazon uses to micromanage its workers. The lawyer on Rana’s case, Scott Harrison, aims to prove that Amazon still exerts control over its Delivery Service Partners using technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="94zLuN"&gt;Amazon closely tracks delivery drivers’ every move, the lawsuit states, including ‘backup monitoring, speed, braking, acceleration, cornering, seatbelt usage, phone calls, texting, in-van cameras that use artificial intelligence to detect for yawning, and more.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OcG3ST"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, most commercial vehicle lawsuits like this are typically resolved without much attention. However, Rana’s case is noteworthy due to his legal team’s claims that Amazon’s monitoring systems make the company liable. Rana’s attorney wants to look into exactly how Amazon’s machines control its operations, but doing so would reveal Amazon’s algorithms, which Amazon reportedly argues could be classified as “trade secrets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="idnUkT"&gt;The company designs and assigns routes and determines how many deliveries each driver should be able to accomplish in a 10-hour shift. It monitors each driver’s performance via smartphone app, cameras and other hardware installed in Amazon-branded delivery vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIzgGk"&gt;The company can tell the delivery partners to take drivers it deems too slow off the road, essentially firing them. Rana’s lawsuit argues that such practices made Amazon negligent in the crash because they ‘forced drivers to rush to the point it was unsafe’ and ‘focused on speed and delivery efficiency without giving due consideration to the safety of the public.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P0i68b"&gt;If Rana’s legal strategy works, this could influence the outcome of a number of lawsuits to come. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; mentions that Amazon Logistics has been the defendant in 119 vehicle injury lawsuits this year alone, which reportedly quadruples the number of incidents that occurred last year. And with the holiday season coming up, that number may be on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F09TBI"&gt;In February, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; states that a Texas couple reportedly sued Amazon for $1 million in damages following an alleged crash with a delivery driver — but the case has since been dismissed. Another man in Massachusetts reportedly suffered from brain injuries after a head-on collision with an Amazon delivery driver who allegedly fell asleep at the wheel. Amazon supposedly has yet to respond to that case, which &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says was filed in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baV1xz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-12/amazon-com-algorithms-blamed-in-crash-that-paralyzed-aspiring-doctor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;/a&gt; is an eye-opening story that’s both heartbreaking and angering, but still provides a small shred of hope that something might change. Most importantly, it sheds light on Amazon’s treatment of delivery drivers, as well as how that may have an impact on everyone else on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Business Essentials subscriptions support small businesses that only use Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Business Essentials" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/214E4eCO0GHP-fXd2cfEyioGrgM=/0x33:1500x1033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141412/Apple_Apple_Business_Essentials_11102021_1500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Business Essentials | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epZ2WM"&gt;This week Apple unveiled another beta program, but instead of offering early previews of software for your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, it’s a new initiative &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/business/essentials/"&gt;called Business Essentials&lt;/a&gt;. In line with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;recent shift toward selling services&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a subscription package aimed at small businesses with three different plans and a move that has been anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.fleetsmith.com/fleetsmith-acquired-by-apple"&gt;since it acquired the device management platform Fleetsmith&lt;/a&gt; a little over a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOgfna"&gt;Starting at $2.99 per device per month, they can cover employees across a single device, more than one device, or a more expensive plan that covers multiple devices and adds more cloud storage. An AppleCare+ package will be available when it launches full in spring 2022, adding 24/7 phone support, access to training, and on-site repairs from Apple-trained technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cpUisD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OushE7mq0Ak?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgUa2W"&gt;Like many other device manage platforms, it streamlines the onboarding process, preinstalled apps, as well as management of security settings like FileVault for disk encryption and Activation Lock to secure devices if they’re lost or stolen. There’s also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212754"&gt;a new Business Essentials app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that puts all of the various settings in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSjMeu"&gt;I spoke to Vox Media senior VP of IT, Oumar Sall, who points out that it could be beneficial for startups during periods of high growth. Particularly while dealing with more remote workers, it can help get new employees up and running as quickly as possible even if a business doesn’t have the other parts of its network fully formed yet. It could also be helpful for schools if Apple’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/education/k12/it/"&gt;School Manager&lt;/a&gt; system isn’t a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bYN5BX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vox Media’s Eric Arredondo on working as IT support","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22444109/it-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk"},{"title":"How Apple’s enterprise app program became the new Wild West of mobile apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18232583/apple-ios-developer-enterprise-program-store-mobile-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H9JRyT"&gt;It also has the advantage of being available from Apple itself. However, it’s unlikely to challenge mainstays in the industry since, at least so far, it is limited by the number of employees supported, and it isn’t available across different platforms. There’s also the question of how exporting data works if a company wants to leave iCloud, endpoint security management, and the other issues that can crop up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nsP40"&gt;Jamf is one of those companies, as it provides device management to a number of organizations, including Vox Media. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4468740-jamf-holding-corp-jamf-ceo-dean-hager-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;On an earnings call Friday&lt;/a&gt; after Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-introduces-apple-business-essentials/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Dean Hager said that he expects the service will help improve Apple’s built-in management tools that Jamf also relies on, without competing directly with many features Jamf provides. If Business Essentials helps kickstart adoption among small businesses or startups, it gives them a basis to buy even more Apple devices and services as they grow, even if they eventually move to more on-premises support or another provider altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly relying on states to pay for digital ID rollouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MSYOHsRuYaylI_sE51MNxp6dFS0=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141339/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ftM9p0"&gt;Apple will soon let users in participating states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;digitally store their driver’s licenses&lt;/a&gt; or state IDs on their iPhone’s wallet, but according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/apple-sticking-taxpayers-with-part-of-the-bill-for-digital-id-rollout.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the initiative will be partially funded by the states — and their taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPDAbi"&gt;CNBC got ahold of contracts signed by Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, and found that Apple will maintain tight control over its deployment. It reports that Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program, including its device compatibility, the service’s launch date, states’ marketing campaigns, as well as how states report on the initiative's performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qXNBn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R1qbG0"&gt;The contract also says that each state will have to “allocate reasonably sufficient personnel and resources (e.g., staff, project management and funding) to support the launch of the Program on a timeline to be determined by Apple.” This includes testing out the service on different types of Apple devices “in accordance with Apple’s certification requirements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9AUXV"&gt;Additionally, states are responsible for promoting the digital ID service to citizens, as well as encouraging its adoption among members of the federal and state government, including local police and the Internal Revenue Service. State agencies are required to “feature the Program in all public-facing communications relating to Digital Identity Credentials,” which is subject to Apple’s review and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNp0wG"&gt;And if that isn’t enough, Apple is holding states accountable for the authenticity of the program’s identity verification. The contract absolves Apple from any discrepancies in its verification system, stating: “Apple shall not be liable for any Verification Results, and Agency acknowledges that all Verification Results are provided ‘AS IS’ and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i54w6P"&gt;Despite being an Apple-led program, taxpayers are footing the bill to roll out this single-platform digital ID program in their states — even if they don’t have an iPhone. The contract clearly says “except as otherwise agreed upon between the Parties, neither Party shall owe the other Party any fees under this Agreement,” meaning that the participating states will be funding its promotion and adoption using taxpayer’s tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQQcCq"&gt;Having a digital ID program — especially one paid for by states — raises a number of concerns, the most obvious one being security. Users are expected to transfer their most sensitive documents to their iPhones, essentially establishing their identities on a single device. If implemented incorrectly, it sets a precedent for surveillance; what happens to user information when a digital ID is scanned at an airport or at an age-restricted concert? This type of tracking information is tempting to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDQ6WF"&gt;Much like what Apple is trying to do with its digital ID program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516653/clear-identity-health-covid-airports"&gt;Clear, a digital identification app&lt;/a&gt;, serves as a fast pass to the front of security lines in airports and sports stadiums, or as an app to store proof of your COVID-19 vaccination. As an article by &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, Clear considered selling user data in the past, but instead uses that data to promote relevant ads to users. No matter how Apple chooses to leverage this data, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;digital ID system is making its way to Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, Maryland, and Utah, in addition to the four aforementioned states, very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG3sqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
