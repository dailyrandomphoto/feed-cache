    <title>Microsoft is getting back into physical retail — sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOiLy6nmMlxa6cEzDmR1u3jAOZo=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423450/twarren_190709_3533_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IyGoax"&gt;Microsoft is returning to selling products at brick-and-mortar stores, kind of. The software giant will start selling products at its “Experience Centers” in London, New York City, and Sydney next month. Select Microsoft products will be available on July 1st, but the global chip shortage will impact what’s available to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsDSdJ"&gt;Xbox Series X / S consoles won’t be available initially, until stocks of these devices improve to meet demand. Other Xbox-related products will be available, alongside Surface devices and Microsoft 365 subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hTlM8"&gt;“Our Microsoft Experience Centers were created to provide customers a way to experience our products in person,” said Travis Walter, Microsoft’s head of retail stores, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We use these spaces to test and experiment, and continue to evolve the experience based on customer feedback. Starting July 1st, customers will be able to purchase select Microsoft products at the New York, London and Sydney locations.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Experience Center in London.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xYniNS"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21297400/microsoft-retail-stores-closing-cities-open"&gt;permanently closed its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; in the US and around the world last year, shortly after the pandemic began. The company has been moving store employees to areas that help sell to, train, and support Microsoft’s business customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9wyqu"&gt;This move doesn’t signal a return of Microsoft’s retail stores, and there won’t be online ordering or pick up in store available. Microsoft has been using its four Experience Center locations to host business customers, and the ability to purchase items is primarily aimed at those who visit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI secretly launched an encrypted messaging system for criminals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NETHERLANDS-EU-POLICE-CRIME" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjL0GxXmzYAJTp8lg_9KzZRkhxI=/483x0:4205x2481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423325/1233329640.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JERRY LAMPEN/ANP/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uKFDmm"&gt;An encrypted phone service called Anom was secretly run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a yearslong international sting operation. Law enforcement agencies across Europe, the US, and Oceania revealed Anom’s origins earlier today, saying they had &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/800-criminals-arrested-in-biggest-ever-law-enforcement-operation-against-encrypted-communication"&gt;arrested 800 criminal suspects&lt;/a&gt; based on intercepted communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoJMeB"&gt;According to public statements, the FBI and other agencies seeded secure Anom phones with suspected crime syndicates, gradually building a network of around 12,000 total (and 9,000 active) devices. The phones secretly siphoned 27 million messages between 2019 and 2021, resulting in Operation Greenlight / Trojan Shield — a large-scale bust that included seizing around eight tons of cocaine, 22 tons of cannabis and cannabis resin, 250 firearms, and $48 million in traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0QPp0e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anom filled a void left by other encrypted service shutdowns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DGy2Cr"&gt;Seamus Hughes, a George Washington University researcher, offered more details from &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20799201-operation-trojan-shield-court-record"&gt;court records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shield-anom-fbi-secret-phone-network"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; based on Hughes’ work, Anom started in 2018 after police shut down Phantom Secure, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pa73dz/fbi-tried-to-plant-backdoor-in-encrypted-phone-phantom-secure"&gt;an encrypted device network&lt;/a&gt; used mostly (the FBI alleges exclusively) by drug traffickers and other organized criminals. An unnamed informant, who had previously sold Phantom Secure phones, told the FBI they were building a “next generation” encrypted device called Anom. The informant offered the system to the FBI and Australian Federal Police in exchange for a reduced sentence on criminal charges, then agreed to sell Anom phones to their existing distribution network that catered to organized crime, giving the new system credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blTkav"&gt;Unbeknownst to buyers, each Anom message included a “master key” that would let law enforcement decrypt its contents, and each device tied a fixed ID number to any username the owner chose. The messages secretly routed to servers that the FBI — as well as the AFP and later other police agencies — could access. A court filing cites examples of these messages, including photos of cocaine packages and conversations about how to smuggle shipments of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqgQ7h"&gt;Most early Anom users were located in Australia. But the network ultimately covered 90 countries, with Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, and Serbia seeing the most users. Its growth surged in early 2021, when law enforcement &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88aybp/sky-secure-shuts-down-blackberry"&gt;shut down Sky Global&lt;/a&gt;, another encrypted messaging company. A press release from Europol says that 300 criminal syndicates used Anom devices, including “Italian organized crime, outlaw motorcycle gangs, and international drug trafficking organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YM5WUC"&gt;Beyond direct busts made with Anom data, the FBI described Anom as a move to “shake the  confidence in this entire industry” of encrypted device services. Police have tried to plant backdoors in &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-time-tim-cook-stood-his-ground-against-fbi/"&gt;both general-purpose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pa73dz/fbi-tried-to-plant-backdoor-in-encrypted-phone-phantom-secure"&gt;specifically crime-focused&lt;/a&gt; messaging services, and they’ve &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hansa-dutch-police-sting-operation/"&gt;hijacked platforms&lt;/a&gt; like dark web marketplaces to catch illegal activity — but it’s rarer to see an agency help launch a brand-new phone network for the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse and its clones have an accessibility problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nine colorful squares on a pale blue background. The middle row of squares have audio waveforms in them. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpUlsGdkyy3lrsoej-Hw1Psthig=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423308/acastro_210430_1777_audioApps_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RX6ygo"&gt;Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;took off&lt;/a&gt; last year and spurred competitors to add their own voice chat rooms that can host hundreds if not thousands of people. But the hit app has had a serious problem from the beginning, consistently &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-a-club-so-exclusive-it-excludes-disabled-people-by-design/"&gt;pointed out by accessibility advocates&lt;/a&gt;: it excludes disabled people, with the most obvious issue being that the audio-based app doesn’t have built-in captions. This makes it unusable for deaf people and difficult to use for people who are hard of hearing or struggle with audio processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPCY8R"&gt;Companies will often mention that their products are still in development or beta testing when discussing accessibility options, but the ideal development process involves working with disabled people from the earliest design stages. Tech accessibility has improved in major ways over the years, but it’s still frequently tacked on well after products are launched. The reality is that disabled people often have to use products and services that don’t have even the bare minimum of features that suit their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmbDrF"&gt;Clubhouse “excludes millions of people around the world who are Deaf and hard of hearing,” says Adam Pottle, a Deaf author. “We cannot access these conversations, and it’s especially dispiriting because many of the conversations taking place on this platform are fascinating and cultural and timely, yet we can’t take part in them.” Pottle notes that a January Clubhouse blog was titled “&lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/welcoming-more-voices"&gt;Welcoming More Voices&lt;/a&gt;,” but made no mention of transcription, sign language interpretation, or captioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDHTW0"&gt;Now, with a number of competitors working on social audio functions that are similar to Clubhouse, it’s a prime chance to step back and look at how each one approaches accessibility. Some companies, like Twitter’s Spaces, have more detailed accessibility strategies than others. But others, like Discord, already have voice or video functions that are at least partially inaccessible and didn’t have many details to share. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of current and upcoming Clubhouse competitors and how they stack up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6aXhj"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SWU24V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability&lt;/em&gt;: Available on iOS and Android, invite-only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxrOzG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Besides the lack of captioning, Clubhouse also doesn’t support text resizing, which is essential for many people with low vision. Though it was exclusive to iOS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22424399/clubhouse-android-app-release-date-news-features"&gt;until last month&lt;/a&gt;, it didn’t support VoiceOver, Apple’s screen reading software, until February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pklxSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessibility details&lt;/em&gt;: “Our goal has always been to build Clubhouse for everyone,” says a Clubhouse spokesperson. Clubhouse says it is “grateful” for the feedback from disability-related clubs that have formed within the app, and says it has been working closely with The 15%, a club for disabled people and allies. Clubhouse says it plans to introduce closed captioning “in the near future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7tdDQA"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vsSdyB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability&lt;/em&gt;: Accounts with over 600 followers can host, anyone can listen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azsEDf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;faced criticism&lt;/a&gt; last year after introducing voice tweets without captions, which spurred the company to create accessibility teams and be more transparent about its accessibility efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9tsQ6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessibility details&lt;/em&gt;: Spaces has an option to turn on automatic captions, though they’re not &lt;a href="https://liamodell.com/2021/01/16/twitter-spaces-deaf-captions-clubhouse-audio/"&gt;consistently accurate or easy to read&lt;/a&gt;. Buttons within Spaces are labeled so that screen readers can identify the function of each one. Twitter says &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-spaces-accessible.html"&gt;it’s working on improvements&lt;/a&gt;, including making captions more accurate, enabling scrollback and pausing, making the color and size of captions customizable, and possibly adding a text input option in addition to speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iEqr6u"&gt;Discord Stage Channels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6BkAVR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Only in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server"&gt;Community servers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwX8jt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Discord already had voice channels, which don’t have built-in captioning. An accessibility section with options for reduced motion, autoplay, and text-to-speech was added to the user settings menu &lt;a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2021/05/04/discord-announces-accessibility-menu/"&gt;in late April&lt;/a&gt;. It already supports screen readers, keyboard navigation, and third-party captioning and transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnCzuC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessibility details&lt;/em&gt;: Like voice channels, Stage Channels currently don’t have a built-in option for captions. A spokesperson said Discord is working on more ways to make Stage Channels accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="K7l0oh"&gt;Reddit Talk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GF77VK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability&lt;/em&gt;: Currently in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391875/reddit-talk-clubhouse-social-audio"&gt;initial testing&lt;/a&gt; with subreddit moderators, tentative plans for larger launch in coming months&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XNyDJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Some blind people &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/reddit-blind-visually-impaired-social-media-platform-for-people-2020-6"&gt;favor Reddit&lt;/a&gt; over other social platforms because so much of it is text-based. But images still don’t have alt text, which has led to an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/"&gt;entire subreddit&lt;/a&gt; of volunteer transcribers who write image descriptions and video captions for as many posts as they can. Reddit has had livestreams since 2019 but so far hasn’t had built-in captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qq57b4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessibility details&lt;/em&gt;: The version that’s in testing doesn’t have captioning. Reddit says accessibility, possibly including caption support, is a priority for the official launch but didn’t provide any additional details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Bo6KOl"&gt;Facebook Live Audio Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M9PjLe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability&lt;/em&gt;: Expected across Facebook, including Messenger, this summer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEWqXR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Facebook enabled caption support for Facebook Live &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/making-facebook-live-more-accessible-with-closed-captions/"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/new-automated-captions-powered-by-ai/"&gt;added auto-captions&lt;/a&gt; last year. It also &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2020/07/30/web/facebook-com-accessibility/"&gt;made improvements&lt;/a&gt; to its screen reader support, added scalable font sizes last year, and &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/how-facebook-is-using-ai-to-improve-photo-descriptions-for-people-who-are-blind-or-visually-impaired/"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; its automatic alt text in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4AkDB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessibility details&lt;/em&gt;: A Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; says captions will be offered for Live Audio Rooms and other upcoming audio features. Facebook didn’t respond to a request for further information about plans for accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xaFCdG"&gt;Slack audio meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HBMDmB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability&lt;/em&gt;: Currently &lt;a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/blog/collaboration/innovation-for-a-new-moment"&gt;in testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta1jKi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Slack’s &lt;a href="https://slack.com/accessibility"&gt;accessibility settings&lt;/a&gt; include screen reader support, keyboard navigation, adjustable zoom levels, and toggles for emoji movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BiZaw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accessibility details&lt;/em&gt;: Slack confirmed its audio feature will have captioning, livestream transcription, and screen reader support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NYn2Z0"&gt;Other platforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nHMSpU"&gt;There are even more platforms with Clubhouse-like audio rooms in the works. LinkedIn didn’t share any details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;its audio plans&lt;/a&gt;, but it did &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-linkedin-live-auto-captions-alana-smith-she-her-/"&gt;add automatic captioning&lt;/a&gt; to LinkedIn Live earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Fireside&lt;/a&gt;, a combination podcast and live audio app planned for launch this year, says in a statement that providing accessibility options is “hugely important,” and that it will have multiple features including audio transcription. Spotify didn’t respond to a request for information about accessibility plans for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;upcoming live audio conversations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsqcuP"&gt;So far, none of these platforms make for perfect templates of accessibility, and it’s hard to find popular sites that meet every single &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"&gt;web accessibility standard&lt;/a&gt;. There are always many elements to factor in because disabilities are so diverse. Screen reader compatibility doesn’t mean sites and apps are easy to use without needing to see the screen. Automatic captions are never completely accurate, especially for speakers with accents and speech differences. There are other considerations like color contrast, notification sounds, and overall layout. A mobile app might be accessible in ways that a desktop app or web version isn’t, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8okPEn"&gt;Disabled people have said over and over that accessibility needs to be considered from multiple angles at every step of development. A real commitment to accessibility looks like hiring disabled people, continually seeking feedback, and being transparent about what works and what doesn’t. It’s easy for companies to release vague statements saying they value accessibility, but they have to prove it by actually putting in the work to make their products usable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s live-action take on Cowboy Bebop is coming this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cowboy Bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MvR00kfjHLDV2aQHwJOG0XSr4mg=/0x11:1146x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423298/bebop.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wl61Bm"&gt;Netflix has announced that the long-awaited live-action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop &lt;/em&gt;will premiere this fall. The science fiction, noir, and Western-infused bounty hunting series will also feature new music from the anime’s original composer, Yoko Kanno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV7vMJ"&gt;There was, unfortunately, no trailer alongside Netflix’s announcement, but it did reintroduce a few of the cast members, who already seem to be fitting into their roles quite well — specifically John Cho as Spike Spiegel, Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black, and Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="etzR9m"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yoko Kanno, the composer behind the iconic soundtrack of the original COWBOY BEBOP anime will be creating the soundtrack for the new Live Action Series. Also confirmed...Cowboy Bebop is coming this Fall. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6lHZQcoFR6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6lHZQcoFR6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1402301557094244352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MoTZIU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15745990/cowboy-bebop-live-action-series"&gt;Reports first surfaced&lt;/a&gt; that Netflix was producing a live-action adaptation of the iconic series in 2017 and were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115752/cowboy-bebop-netflix-live-action-series-announced"&gt;later confirmed in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The full cast of actors playing the show’s bounty hunters was revealed in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295535/netflix-cowboy-bebop-john-cho-spike-live-action-series"&gt;including Cho&lt;/a&gt; as the series lead. The show is set to receive a 10-episode season written by one of the screenwriters of &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; Christopher Yost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAUNzJ"&gt;We’ll have to wait a bit longer for a real look at the new &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, but at least we can rest assured space bounty hunting antics will be kicking off later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram chief explains how the service decides what you see</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ccao1Z"&gt;Instagram chief Adam Mosseri shed some light on how the social network decides what you see in a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works"&gt;new blog post published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The explanation seems to be meant at least in part to combat persistent rumors that Instagram intentionally hides or disfavors certain posts, which Instagram says isn’t exactly true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFu2ai"&gt;The short answer to how Instagram works is that it’s complicated. Instagram uses “thousands” of signals to determine what you see in your feed, according to Mosseri, and there isn’t just one algorithm that decides what shows up for you. But the company is also committed to better explaining why content is taken down and how the service surfaces posts, he writes. One of the more surprising revelations: most Instagram followers won’t see your posts anyway because “most people look at less than half of their Feed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="USQttL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Most people look at less than half of their Feed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YVdfRz"&gt;Tuesday’s blog is just the first of a series that “will shed more light on how Instagram’s technology works and how it impacts the experiences that people have across the app,” for example, so it seems we can expect more detailed breakdowns in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUln4e"&gt;In this first blog, Mosseri explained that Instagram uses “a variety of algorithms, classifiers, and processes, each with its own purpose” to determine what to show you. He then broke down the “signals” Instagram uses to surface something in your feed or in stories. Here are the “most important” signals, “roughly in order of importance:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RiSv8C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information about the post&lt;/strong&gt;. These are signals both about how popular a post is – think how many people have liked it – and more mundane information about the content itself, like when it was posted, how long it is if it’s a video, and what location, if any, was attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVdSgZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information about the person who posted&lt;/strong&gt;. This helps us get a sense for how interesting the person might be to you, and includes signals like how many times people have interacted with that person in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoPctI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your activity&lt;/strong&gt;. This helps us understand what you might be interested in and includes signals such as how many posts you’ve liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLHXPA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your history of interacting with someone&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives us a sense of how interested you are generally in seeing posts from a particular person. An example is whether or not you comment on each other’s posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IXRPPz"&gt;Instagram will then predict how you might interact with a post, such as commenting or liking it. “The more likely you are to take an action, and the more heavily we weigh that action, the higher up you’ll see the post,” Mosseri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtNC3M"&gt;Mosseri also addressed how people accuse the service of silencing or “shadowbanning” users and said the company will do a better job of explaining why content is removed. “We’re developing better in-app notifications so people know in the moment why, for instance, their post was taken down, and exploring ways to let people know when what they post goes against our Recommendations Guidelines,” Mosseri said. Instagram will have “more to share soon” on those updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqnC86"&gt;The blog post also details the signals the company uses to show you content in the Explore tab and on Reels (Instagram’s TikTok-like video service) — which, notably, primarily show you content from accounts you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtaryI"&gt;Mosseri’s explanation hits as Instagram is kicking off &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPBYK14I3nq/"&gt;its Creator Week event&lt;/a&gt;, designed to help creators build their brands on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aqara M2 ecosystem review: a smart home for less</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Why spend more?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nhD158"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AqaraSmarthouse/status/1402247808489508864"&gt;Aqara M2 smart home hub officially launches in the US today&lt;/a&gt;, making it the ideal time to take a deeper look at the company’s inventory of inexpensive smart home devices that work with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtqviP"&gt;While Aqara might not have the brand cachet of Philips Hue or Samsung SmartThings, it’s been around since 2016 — an eternity for smart home companies. The Aqara brand is owned by Lumi United Technology, a Xiaomi ecosystem company based in Shenzhen, China. Aqara entered the US market in 2019 and now claims to serve over 2 million customers across 192 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWqIAh"&gt;Aqara bills the M2 as the company’s “&lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/product/hub-m2"&gt;most advanced and future-proof smart home hub&lt;/a&gt;.” It connects to your home network via ethernet or 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and the Zigbee 3.0 radio controls up to 128 related devices like smart bulbs, switches, and sensors. It’ll even control infrared devices like air conditioners, fans, TVs, or humidifiers thanks to a 360-degree IR blaster that circles the hub. One day “soon,” Aqara says the M2 will also control Bluetooth LE sensors and bulbs, for example, but this wasn’t ready for me to test. The M2 is fitted with a small speaker than can be used for security alerts, a doorbell, or alarm clock. The whole thing is powered from a 5V 1A Micro-USB port, meaning the M2 hub can run for up to 30 hours when plugged into a typical 10,000mAh portable charger in the event of power failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db1qpl"&gt;I’ve been intrigued by Aqara for some time, so I decided to test the new M2 hub alongside the older M1S hub and 12 Aqara devices here in Europe where the M2 has been shipping for a while (it was announced in 2019). I also ran everything through HomeKit since the M2 takes advantage of both adaptive lighting and HomeKit secure video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="85adXU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More capable than expected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wHa50T"&gt;All in all, setup was quite easy and intuitive, and several of Aqara’s devices proved more capable than I expected. There were quirks, but they’re easy to overlook for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lAW3WL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10596437"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMYFv2"&gt;My Aqara test network consisted of 16 Aqara devices spread across three floors of a narrow but tall Amsterdam home. I placed the new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-Control-Automation-Supports-Assistant/dp/B08Y1PJZZH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$57.99&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Control-Gateway-HomeKit-Compatibility-Ethernet/dp/B08X23Z55L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€56.99&lt;/a&gt; M2 hub in my office on the top floor (third) and the older M1S hub in the living room on the ground floor (first) mainly because it has a very useful nightlight built in. The M1S is also totally self contained in a unit that plugs into any wall outlet without any cabling mess. Although my router is on the ground floor I have ethernet runs to my office, making the distance to the M2 a non-issue. With this setup, I was able to ensure top-to-bottom Zigbee 3.0 network coverage for all the Aqara child devices: six bridged to the M2 and six bridged to the M1S. The Aqara Home app makes it easy to view signal strength for each child device on a scale that ranges from poor to acceptable to good, with graphs showing how the strength changes over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znG2Xn"&gt;Unfortunately, you can’t move child devices between hubs. This could be useful in cases where you move a sensor originally assigned to, say, the M1S to a room that receives a stronger signal from the M2. Instead, you have to remove the sensor from the original hub and add it back to the new hub. Fortunately, the process isn’t destructive as it maintains any automations already created in the Aqara app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJbDPD"&gt;Here’s a list of all the Aqara devices I tested alongside Aqara’s recommended retail prices in USD and Euros where available: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ALVFeb"&gt;One Camera Hub G2H (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-Security-Family-Friendly-Wireless-Surveillance/dp/B08F2DBP3Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$64.99&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Aqara-Camera-Hub-G2H-HomeKit/dp/B08X1PSG8K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€75.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VXuz4d"&gt;One Wireless Remote Switch EU (double rocker) (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/WRS-R02-Wireless-Remote-Switch-Version/dp/B094QL17GY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€29.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0KrNOT"&gt;One Smart Wall Switch H1 EU (no neutral) (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/WRS-R02-Wireless-Remote-Switch-Version/dp/B094QL17GY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€39.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uC0s82"&gt;One Smart Plug (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-12LM-ZNCZ-Smart-White/dp/B07CJ2MM6Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29.99 &lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Aqara-Smart-Plug-EU-HomeKit/dp/B087M8LF63?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€32.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E9hG8S"&gt;Four Door and Window sensors (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-MCCGQ11LM-Window-Sensor-White/dp/B07D37VDM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$17.99&lt;/a&gt; /&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/WSDCGQ11LM-Aqara-Door-and-Window/dp/B07D37FKGY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; €16.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7UDpoq"&gt;One Water Leak Sensor (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-11LM-SJCGQ-Water-Sensor/dp/B07D39MSZS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$18.99&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/SJCGQ11LM-Aqara-Door-and-Window/dp/B07D39MSZS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€21.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AXiqPc"&gt;One Vibration Sensor ($19.49 / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Aqara-DJT11LM-vibration-sensor-detector/dp/B07PJT939B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€18.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IWvQ5e"&gt;One Motion Sensor (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-RTCGQ11LM-Motion-Sensor-White/dp/B07D1CRRVF?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20.49&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/RTCGQ11LM-Aqara-B07D1CRRVF-Motion-Sensor/dp/B07D1CRRVF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€23.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0D4GBF"&gt;One Temperature and Humidity Sensor (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-WSDCGQ11LM-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor/dp/B07D37FKGY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.99 &lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Homekit-Temperature-Humidity-Compatible-WSDCGQ11LM/dp/B087LWH5L1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€18.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4mPlBM"&gt;My test network is fairly representative of the Aqara ecosystem, which varies in availability by region. Generally speaking, the &lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/products.html"&gt;US has the least amount of choice&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/eu/products.html"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; where Aqara also ships lightbulbs, a greater variety of wired and wireless dimmers and switches, a smart door lock, and even a controller for window shades. &lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/cn/productIndex"&gt;China has far greater choice&lt;/a&gt; still, much of which will likely eventually trickle out to the other Aqara regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFN9xw"&gt;So, let’s briefly dig into each of these Aqara child devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkc30dZUP7ZFphgASHlyUi7rsNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644693/verge_DSC_4403_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aqara M2 Hub (left), G2H camera hub (center), and M1S hub (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J8gfei"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera hub G2H&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SbAEE9"&gt;As the name implies, the G2H camera has the unique ability to also act as a hub for Aqara child devices. This can be useful for smart home newbies who aren’t ready to fully commit to Aqara but would still like an indoor camera that’s compatible with Apple’s excellent HomeKit Secure Video service. For example, you could drop the G2H into your home network and pair an Aqara Vibration Sensor to it that would tell the camera to start recording if a window was broken or forced open, without ever having to install an Aqara M1S or M2 hub. The G2H can connect up to 64 Aqara child devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPGcB2"&gt;The G2H camera also features two-way audio, ultra-wide 140-degree coverage, 1080p resolution, infrared night vision, definable activity zones, and a magnetic mount for easy placement on tables, walls, or the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtCnA7"&gt;The G2H can record video in three ways: to the Aqara cloud, to a local microSD card (up to 32GB), or to your iCloud drive with HomeKit Secure Video enabled. I disabled the Aqara cloud recording features in favor of both microSD and HomeKit Secure Video (requires a compatible iCloud subscription of 200GB or more). Recordings to microSD benefit from an event timeline. In my home for example, I can scroll the timeline quickly by looking at the colored bars that signal the front and back doors opening, or the booze cabinet opening (I have teens). HomeKit Secure Video allows me to confidently flip on AI face recognition linked to my iCloud library so that I receive notifications when family members come home. HomeKit Secure Video also stores videos for up to 10 days without affecting my storage quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxTqgp"&gt;Aqara homes can be configured in one of six predefined regions: China Mainland, Europe, United States, South Korea, Russia, and Other. When selecting Europe, like I did, I’m protected by European GDPR law as explained in &lt;a href="http://cdn.aqara.com/cdn/app/mainland/h5/index.html#/privacyPolicy_GDPR?language=en"&gt;Aqara’s EU privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. Aqara has its own &lt;a href="http://cdn.aqara.com/cdn/app/mainland/h5/index.html#/privacy/general/en?language=en"&gt;privacy policy for the United States&lt;/a&gt;, which you should read if you’re concerned how this Chinese company might handle your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKj2DI"&gt;Overall, I really like the G2H as a do-it-all camera for the home, especially for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/53IhWN-TacMmDGLPlCN2I7eYaUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644688/verge_DSC_4457_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Smart Wall Switch H1 installed in my kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tQMKxp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired and wireless switches and smart outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YaPKYW"&gt;I tested two Aqara switches: the &lt;a href="https://www.aqara.com/eu/product/smart-wall-switch-h1-no-neutral"&gt;Smart Wall Switch H1 EU (single rocker, no neutral)&lt;/a&gt; and the double rocker Wireless Remote Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yi5sIsrZ7RpeJfyVNH1F5A_rxFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644685/verge_IMG_7921_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Installing the H1 Switch in the original socket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1suScRBNx04zDG-EvAWCcYevS1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644686/verge_IMG_7923_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wiring the H1 into household electricity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PuO9Vf"&gt;The H1 wall switch is powered from the household wiring like any other light switch but results in making standard lightbulbs smart. I installed mine in the kitchen to control four existing LED spotlights that illuminate the countertop during food preparation. In addition to enabling Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa voice control, I was able to define an automation in the Aqara app so that the lights will automatically turn off after 30 minutes whenever anyone is making a late-night snack and forgets to turn off the spots (teens!). I like the finish of the H1 and the reassuring heavy-mechanical &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt; it makes when pressed. Aqara also makes &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-REQUIRES-Automation-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B081ZQWX1F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US versions&lt;/a&gt; of these switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSC0n5"&gt;Although the Wireless Remote Switch shares the same form factor and tactility of the H1, it’s an entirely different product. First, it’s battery powered and meant to control other Aqara devices like smart lightbulbs or smart plugs. By default, it’s added in what Aqara calls a “high-speed click mode” which I immediately changed to “multi-function mode” to expose the single-click, double-click, and long-press actions to HomeKit for both the left and right buttons of the double-rocker switch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hybaulH5KQCfy3YAf4-onAMKc-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644687/verge_DSC_4463_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aqara Wireless Remote Switch next to an old Hue remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5T0MTP"&gt;In the Apple Home app, I assigned a single press of the left button to turn on the Aqara Smart Plug behind my TV (with a Govee Immersion LED light strip plugged in), my Apple TV box, and LG OLED TV; and defined a double press to turn it all back off. While the Aqara app can show the energy usage of the Smart Plug over time, it can’t expose this information to HomeKit, nor can it use the information as a trigger even in the Aqara app. Ideally, I’d just plug my TV into the Aqara Smart Plug and kick off a bunch of automations when the plug detected that the TV had just turned on or off. Alas, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ8r0o"&gt;I couldn’t test the in-wall Single Switch Module T1 from Aqara as I was sent the version that requires a neutral wire. Nevertheless, I’m happy to see Aqara making these for people who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447008/hue-wall-module-make-any-switch-smart"&gt;prefer to make their existing switches smart instead of their lightbulbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgGKZ1IyuXKJiGcKkDyBTUANZe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644689/verge_DSC_4440_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aqara Motion Sensor also contains a light sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="167PIW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Door, window, motion, vibration, temperature &amp;amp; humidity, and water sensors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sdk44k"&gt;Aqara sensors offer great value and functionality that the company claims will last for two or more years on a single coin battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0ttdF"&gt;The nondescript white Door and Window sensors are particularly notable. For just $17.99 / €16.99  each, you can attach the little sensors on all your doors and windows with double-sided tape to enable any number of smart home scenarios. I have a HomeKit automation that sends me an alert when my roof hatch is open and rain is expected in the next 15 minutes (or has already arrived). I also have them configured to send alerts when the front door or freezer door have been left open too long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icxRPS"&gt;The Door and Window sensors are also useful when tied to any of the four native HomeKit alarm modes (Home, Away, Night, and Off) supported by the M2 Hub (the M1S only supports on and off). In that way, the Aqara M2 can be used to create a basic home security and self-monitoring solution without having to pay any subscription fees. However, the M2’s speaker is anemic at best, so triggered alarms won’t be heard by any neighbors and are barely audible on other floors when music is playing. Anyone needing a dependable home security solution should look elsewhere for a professionally monitored service.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sq8VnND7b4DG1jRg0O4wzP3mPcU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644690/verge_DSC_4428_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two halves of a Door and Window Sensor shown far apart and reporting “open” in the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fXggUf"&gt;The $20.49 / €23.99 Aqara Motion sensors are also incredibly useful. I configured the sensor to automatically trigger a Hue bulb whenever anyone enters the laundry room. It then shuts off the light automatically after five minutes. I love the tilting mount than can be placed just about anywhere, as long as you don’t mind the double-sided tape. The tape is convenient until you have to move the sensor and potentially strip paint or paper from the wall. The motion sensor has a reasonably fast reset time of one minute and includes a light sensor in the device. While the light sensor can’t be used as a trigger in HomeKit, it can in the Aqara app. Overall, the Aqara sensor is reasonably priced compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310841/ikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test"&gt;Ikea’s Tradfri motion sensor&lt;/a&gt; with slower three-minute reset, no light sensor, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tradfri-wireless-motion-sensor-white-60377655/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22310841/ikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22074882__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$14.99&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/tradfri-draadloze-bewegingssensor-wit-70429913/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22310841/ikea-shortcut-button-motion-sensor-homekit-smart-home-review-test&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22074882__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€12.95&lt;/a&gt; price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1egbn"&gt;I was dubious of the Aqara Vibration Sensor before testing it out but eventually figured out a way for it to be useful. It detects vibration, tilts, and drops in addition to being configurable for three sensitivity settings (low, medium, high). Tilt is useful on a mailbox opening, for example, assuming your Zigbee signal will reach the end of a driveway, while vibration can be useful for detecting broken windows and identifying when the washer and dryer are running. I put mine on a tilting cabinet door to alert me when someone is accessing my prized collection of brown booze (teens!!).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muRf_OlLrqMc4P-coJySRmDG_Qc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644691/verge_DSC_4426_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aqara Water Leak Sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kYXklu"&gt;The Aqara Temperature Sensor and Humidity and Water Leak Sensor also work as advertised. The Temp sensor, like many similar cheap sensors, is inaccurate when exposed to direct sunlight, measuring almost twice the actual air temperature at times. Otherwise, it’s useful for triggering a Smart Plug to turn on a fan, humidifier, or smart blinds. Aqara envisions its Water Leak Sensor being used to send a signal to the Aqara Smart Plug to shut off a smart water valve in the case of a water leak. I currently have my review sensor sitting in a saucer just inside my roof hatch to alert me when rain comes inside. I’m tempted to try &lt;a href="https://home-assistant-guide.com/2021/02/03/turn-an-aqara-water-leak-sensor-into-an-instant-rain-meter/"&gt;this hack&lt;/a&gt; to turn it into a real-time rain sensor so I can prevent the water from accumulating in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc0LCz"&gt;The M2 seems to offer a slight advantage over the M1S in terms of Zigbee coverage. For example, the M2 on my third floor was able to maintain a “poor” connection to the Water Sensor when moved to the first floor, but the M1S on the first floor lost connection to the same Water Sensor when moved to the third. But if coverage is your issue, then it’s better to plop another powered Aqara device into your network (like a Wall Switch or Smart Plug) which also double as range extenders for the Zigbee mesh network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iqz9Wo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;360-degree infrared control &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uZ17pr"&gt;Although I don’t have much use for a 360-degree IR blaster, it’s neat that the M2 includes it, I guess. There are plenty of IR controllable home devices like TVs, window shades, air conditioners, and fans in the world that would benefit from being included in the smart home. Just keep in mind that it’ll require line of sight visibility to the black plastic M2 hub, which looks better in a utility closet than out on a shelf. Nevertheless, I did test the IR capabilities on a handful of devices. I was able to train the M2 to control a cheap strand of LED lightbulbs and my LG OLED TV, yet it failed with another strand of LED lights and my old remote-controlled Hunter Douglas blinds. When successful, added devices can be controlled in the Aqara app and Aqara automations but aren’t exposed to HomeKit at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bFCEEA"&gt;Overall, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the M2 hub and the Aqara ecosystem of products. They’re inexpensive like Ikea’s Zigbee-based Home Smart lineup, which also works with HomeKit, Google Assistant, and Alexa. But Aqara devices are much easier to set up and frequently offer more features and better build quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyOKZ3"&gt;The M2 is mostly an improvement over previous Aqara hubs with support for Zigbee 3.0 (and more child devices), reliable ethernet, HomeKit’s nuanced security modes, and IR control for those who really need it. But it also lacks the clever nightlight, louder speaker, and minimalistic design I enjoyed with the old M1S hub. Aqara also wouldn’t commit to updating the M2 with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter / CHIP support&lt;/a&gt; when asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0kKsO6"&gt;So while I can’t say it’s the “most advanced and future-proof smart home hub” ever, as Aqara claims, I can confirm that building a DIY smart home around the Aqara ecosystem of feature-rich devices is relatively easy, won’t break the bank, and maintains compatibility with Apple, Google, and Amazon smart homes. And really, what more can you ask for?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Playdate preorders begin next month, and here are the first games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6CVApkJ5iiy8GHBok-Z8qSwyiE=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423056/June_hello.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRAsaD"&gt;Panic has announced that the Playdate, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22466184/panic-playdate-handheld-price-double-season-one-games-update-preorder"&gt;$179 handheld console&lt;/a&gt; with a crank and a black-and-white screen, will be available to preorder in July with shipping starting later in the year. The company doesn’t have a specific date lined up just yet, but says it’ll provide at least a week’s notice before orders open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAcSPO"&gt;Panic is doing its best to avoid a PS5/RTX 3080-type stock situation by implementing its own ordering system. “The sooner you order, the sooner you’ll get one, but we’re not going to close the door on you,” says co-founder Cabel Sasser in a video update.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XU9JwDeCEbM3I7qIEJS37ZLb2so=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644670/Playdate_photo_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lkHHDN"&gt;The company is also announcing an adorable stereo dock accessory for the Playdate, which makes it look like an old TV and works as both a Bluetooth speaker and a pen holder. Panic hasn’t given pricing or release information for the dock yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdjhiQ"&gt;Finally, Panic has announced 21 out of the 24 titles that will feature in the Playdate’s first “season.” Details are intentionally being kept secret until each game is automatically downloaded onto the device; owners will get two games a week over 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRnkny"&gt;Here are title screens for all 21 games:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTfEOQNyA3t1w2DKDRdDc0BgZvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644673/Playdate_Season_One_games.png"&gt;

    <title>macOS and tvOS are getting spatial audio support with the AirPods Pro and Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cldvICuW5DevDXGBeqxPhGZAFA8=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69423054/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_10.48.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbWXbF"&gt;Apple is extending support for spatial audio to macOS and tvOS. The feature will work with the company’s high-end AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, using the devices’ built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes to create a 3D audio effect that tracks the listener’s head movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KziSGB"&gt;Apple initially announced spatial audio for the AirPods Pro last year and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;impressed us with the feature’s immersive quality&lt;/a&gt;. At this year’s WWDC, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;extended support for spatial audio to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522889/apple-facetime-android-windows-web-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjAYV5"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fmacos-monterey-introduces-powerful-features-to-get-more-done%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22523914%2Fmacos-tvos-spatial-audio-support-airpods-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, spatial audio for macOS will only work with the AirPods Pro and Max on Macs with the company’s latest M1 chip and the macOS Monterey operating system. During this week’s WWDC &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=2357"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Apple said spatial audio would arrive on tvOS sometime “this fall,” offering a “full-surround experience” and “dynamic head tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IrFYs"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/tvos-and-macos-will-get-spatial-audio-support-for-airpods-pro-and-max"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that spatial audio on tvOS will only work with the Apple TV 4K, and it’s not clear what apps on the Apple TV will support the feature. Or when support for spatial audio through other headphones on either platform will be available. We’ve reached out to Apple to find out more and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces WF-1000XM4 noise-canceling earbuds with LDAC and IPX4 water resistance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0vMMuuTsWDKK31U5J1jXHs_XDmk=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69422893/WF_1000XM4_B_wearing_Mid.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RXiwLY"&gt;After a few weeks of leaks, Sony has today formally announced its latest flagship true wireless earbuds. The new WF-1000XM4 earbuds cost $279.99, and the previous WF-1000XM3s, released in 2019, will remain in the company’s lineup at $229.99. The new headphones will be available in either black or light gray — both with gold accenting. They’re available starting today from retailers including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742864069041575151" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cypifD"&gt;Featuring a completely revamped design that’s 10 percent smaller than their predecessors, the 1000XM4 buds also have a new processing chip that results in improved noise cancellation “at all frequencies,” according to Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JRcEKrq1k0xtdu-mVpC4wLq48A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22644966/1000xm4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0o2YVN"&gt;Battery life has been upped to eight hours of continuous playback when NC is enabled, which soundly beats competitors like the Apple AirPods Pro, Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, and Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. The charging case has been significantly downsized and is 40 percent smaller than before. Aside from plugging in over USB-C, it also supports Qi wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3B2R1"&gt;Sony has also addressed a disappointing omission from the 1000XM3s: these new earbuds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. The 1000XM4s also have an updated voice call system that uses both beamforming mics and bone conduction sensors to improve performance. But here’s the one standout disappointment: there’s still no support for multipoint Bluetooth connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAr07R"&gt;If you’re wondering how all of this shakes out, I’ve been using Sony’s new premium buds for several days. You can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22287625" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;read my full review&lt;/a&gt; of them right now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki’s first two episodes are a blast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p-Pi8q7JATdzDCR631OFJVU10Uw=/642x0:3198x1704/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69422897/TPL2300_101_comp_v810.1037.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A promising start for the trickster’s debut on Disney Plus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WuWpFc"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1084177/9358?subId1=VergeLoki&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt; is first captured by an organization devoted to maintaining the purity of the timestream, it’s a bit like a trip to the DMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AslUsU"&gt;His time at the TVA — otherwise known as the Time Variance Authority — includes taking a number to wait in line, walking through a metal detector-like security device, and verifying some paperwork. But there are some differences compared to getting your license renewed. Failing to queue up properly at the TVA can result in death. And that paperwork? It’s a massive stack consisting of literally everything Loki has ever said (including the two confused words he utters while standing in the office). It’s extremely funny to watch an all-powerful deity be forced through a confusing bureaucracy — and it’s the perfect way to start off the new &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; series on Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHXydg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This review contains light spoilers for the first two episodes of Loki.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAg077"&gt;While Loki has been part of the MCU for a decade, his role has been somewhat scattershot: a handful of memorable appearances spread across six films. &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, a six-episode series on Disney Plus, is his first chance at a starring role. The show follows the character, once again played by Tom Hiddleston, after he stole a magical doodad called a Tesseract in 2019’s &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. Almost immediately, he’s captured by the TVA and accused of being a “variant” that has disrupted the timeline. He’s given a choice: be destroyed or partner with TVA agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) to help track down another fugitive variant who has been killing agents across various time periods. Naturally, Loki chooses the option where he doesn’t die.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDC1o6"&gt;Like other bureaucratic entities from movies like &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hellboy, &lt;/em&gt;the TVA is the kind of organization that exists in the margins, unknown to almost everyone. Its objective is an important one: to maintain a timeline created by three beings known as the Time Keepers in order to prevent anomalies that will create new potentially dangerous timestreams. But they also operate like a straight-laced government department. There are rules and procedures to follow. Men and women sit behind desks oblivious to the outside world, as they appear to exist outside of time and space. (At one point, Loki threatens to gut an office worker like a fish; unfortunately, the desk jockey has no idea what a fish is.) Even magic doesn’t work within the confines of the TVA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX0szZ"&gt;The result is a wonderfully absurd contrast between the mundane and the fantastical. Loki is completely out of place in this world, where his powers are useless and he has no idea what’s going on, making it impossible to truly plot ahead. At first, he’s his old arrogant self. When a judge asks whether he pleads innocent or guilty to being a variant, Loki says simply that gods don’t plead. But eventually, he comes to realize that he can’t fight the TVA, at least until he learns enough about them to come up with a scheme. There are some great slapstick moments, like when Loki is outfitted with a collar that lets a TVA guard send him back in time; every time Loki hops out of a chair for a sneak attack, he’s zapped back into his seat. Later, he fails to get a librarian’s attention until he rings a bell &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;right. These moments drive home just how out of place Loki is — and how in many ways he’s really just&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;another cog in a big cosmic machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5csiS2"&gt;The relationship between Loki and Mobius is one of the most important parts of the show. It almost has a buddy comedy dynamic. The two clearly don’t trust each other, but they form a sort of uneasy alliance. At one point, when Loki tries to convince Mobius to follow one of his hunches, the TVA agent seems to think he’s being led into a trap. To assuage his fears, Loki tells him: “Trust one thing — I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to be right.” The chemistry between Wilson and Hiddleston is great, with the pair able to seamlessly transition from throwing barbs to contemplating serious revelations. Mobius has spent a long time studying Loki, and he’s both unfazed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; impressed by him. Early on, he shows Loki pivotal scenes from his life, asking questions like “Do you like to hurt people?” Eventually, Loki breaks down and starts to worry that he’s a villain. “That’s not how I see it,” Mobius tells him. It’s a touching moment that further complicates an already complicated character, as you can never really tell what side Loki’s on (aside from his own).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbXYIo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; also has a vibe that — at least early on — feels unlike anything else in the MCU. The TVA has a retro-futuristic quality, with computers and interior designs that look ripped from the 1970s. The agency even has a cute little watch mascot, which also appears to be sentient, sort of like a holographic Siri mashed with the Kool-Aid Man. It’s both surreal and grounded, like something Douglas Adams would dream up. And as opposed to the more typical action-oriented Marvel stories, &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;plays out a bit like a police procedural, as Loki and Mobius attempt to figure out just who the fugitive variant is. Without his superpowers, Loki is forced to spend hours at a desk, flipping through files in hopes of finding a clue, before venturing out into the field to investigate. He quickly goes from god to amateur detective. The time travel premise also means that the show is able to jump around a lot, with visits to everywhere from Pompeii to a futuristic big box store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3QXk20"&gt;Much like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is evidence that there’s a lot of room to experiment within the tight confines of the MCU. It blends elements of buddy comedies and police procedurals with a hefty dose of classic sci-fi, helped along by an incredibly charming cast. It’s also a story that seems ideally suited for episodic storytelling, with the space to dig deeper into a character that’s often stuck on the periphery of larger moments. In its first two episodes, &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; nails the formula — now we just have to see if that momentum keeps up for the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
