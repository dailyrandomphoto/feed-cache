    <title>Microsoft tries to evade scalpers by offering Xbox Series X and S to Xbox Insider members</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J9RIFU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxinsider/status/1392168474961747973"&gt;Microsoft is introducing&lt;/a&gt; a new “Console Purchase Pilot” program that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/na2cm6/a_limited_pilot_is_available_to_xbox_insiders_to/gxr3f10/"&gt;will give selected Xbox Insider members&lt;/a&gt; the chance to register to reserve an Xbox Series X or Series S console directly from the company through their existing Xbox One consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBhVCk"&gt;The new program is only rolling out in the US for now, and even if you are given the chance to sign up, it doesn’t mean that you’ll actually be selected to buy one of the highly in-demand consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3GS7GU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we're introducing the Console Purchase Pilot, allowing US &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxInsiders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#XboxInsiders&lt;/a&gt; on Xbox One to register for a chance to reserve an Xbox Series X|S console. Check the Xbox Insider Hub on Xbox One for details. Limited space is available and not all who register will be selected. &lt;a href="https://t.co/MBkQmbSDWc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MBkQmbSDWc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Insider (@xboxinsider) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxinsider/status/1392168474961747973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbpa6a"&gt;Customers will also have to use the Xbox Insider Hub app on an Xbox One console to both sign up for the Console Purchase Pilot and purchase the console itself — you won’t be able to conduct the transaction on a PC, web browser, Xbox 360, or Xbox Series X / S by design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmY9B8"&gt;That means that the program will be intentionally targeted to dedicated Xbox fans who already own an Xbox One console and are looking to upgrade, and it could help cut down on scalpers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/8/13561008/microsoft-xbox-insider-program"&gt;Introduced in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program"&gt;the Xbox Insider program&lt;/a&gt; lets dedicated Xbox fans give direct feedback to Microsoft and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/10/16123506/microsoft-xbox-insider-program-test-preview"&gt;test future software updates and features&lt;/a&gt; ahead of broader public rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdym0n"&gt;And with next-gen consoles expected to be hard to find for months to come — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;at its last update&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft said to expect the new Xboxes to be tough to buy until at least June — testing out new ways to directly sell consoles to fans could be the best way to make sure that more units don’t end up on the eBay aftermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cO1faG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer claims its new Blade 15 is the ‘thinnest’ 15-inch RTX gaming laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QUWkEMZwMgYYEpE0VDP9uFZhvL0=/0x1:3218x2146/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267557/razerblade15advancedmid2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The starting model is roughly one millimeter thinner than the previous generation.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nDSFX"&gt;Razer has just announced new versions of its Blade 15 workhorse gaming laptop, complete with some of the biggest changes to the lineup in some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yyz6e"&gt;Like many other laptops announced today, the new Blade 15 Advanced features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187586"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen H-series processors&lt;/a&gt; and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics chips, with up to a Core i9 11900H (2.5GHz base clock, 4.9GHz boost clock), an RTX 3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory (Razer declined to share the total graphics power ahead of publishing), and a 4K touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKbdjU"&gt;The most welcome improvement might be the new fingerprint-resistant coating making its way to all of these new models. I can’t imagine that it’ll eliminate fingerprints altogether, but this should address one of the biggest annoyances with the prior models. The Windows Hello webcam is getting bumped up to 1080p resolution (from 720p), and Razer claims the trackpads have improved palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg1VuV"&gt;For the new design, Razer managed to shave off a little more than a millimeter from the thickness of the Blade 15 Advanced, coming in at 15.8mm thick. Razer claims that it’s the smallest 15-inch gaming laptop with RTX graphics and is 17 percent smaller by dimensions compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;. This size reduction applies only to the starting model that has the RTX 3060, though. Thinner might sound more appealing, but it isn’t usually better for gaming performance. Nvidia allows OEMs like Razer to choose the wattage and clock speed of the GPU based on their laptop designs, and generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;the thinner the laptop is, the worse it can be running games&lt;/a&gt; compared to thicker laptops that typically allow for bigger cooling systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTyuNS"&gt;The higher-specced options are thicker than this 15.8mm model, but that’s roughly the same thickness as the previous generation. The width and depth of these machines debuting today are also unchanged from the previous gen at 355 and 235mm (13.98 and 9.25 inches), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JSfDKqUjLcrQ5hGoJSXDlRfsIEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504795/razerblade15advancedmid2021_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 15 Advanced can be configured with an FHD, QHD, or 4K display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WHkNjI"&gt;The latest (and thinnest) Blade 15 Advanced starts at $2,299, and this model has a 240Hz QHD IPS panel with 2.5ms response time and 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut. It has an octa-core Intel Core i7-11800H processor, the RTX 3060 GPU with 8GB of video memory, and 16GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200MHz. This thinner model has a 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD that supports PCIe 4.0 for faster read / write and transfer speeds and a 65Wh battery. All other Advanced models have a 80Wh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyJhmY"&gt;The selection of ports across the Advanced lineup is similar but not exactly the same as the models released earlier in 2021. The most notable exceptions are the two new Thunderbolt 4 ports. In addition, you’ll find an UHS-III SD card reader, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a headphone jack, and an HDMI 2.1 port. Aside from that, all new Blade 15 models support Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, 20V charging via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gKwsm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Razer Blade 15 Base review: losing its edge","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4kOAoR"&gt;All of the Advanced models also support upgradeable storage and RAM. The starting model has only one M.2 slot because of its thin design, but all other new models have an additional M.2 slot for a total of up to 4TB of storage supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVwH9Q"&gt;Spending more will get you a better screen, processor, and GPU. Below you can see the specs of each option, as well as the most recent version of the prior Blade 15 Advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Afmvr9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10492453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuAWei"&gt;All of these new Blade 15 Advanced machines will be available for preorder starting Monday, May 17th from Razer. They’ll go on sale and ship sometime in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfWFiP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Razer’s original press release and website incorrectly listed battery capacities. The thinnest Blade 15 Advanced has a 65Wh battery, while the thicker models have a 80Wh battery. This story has been updated with the correct battery information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose a photo storage service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Photos on the Google Pixel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYXwhBgMRaP0gsWNtPB0Z6ePB8k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67778301/google_photos_vlad_savov.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q9HfSI"&gt;Last November, Google — which until now has offered unlimited storage for “high quality” (read: compressed) photos — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;announced that “unlimited” is being changed&lt;/a&gt; to “up to 15GB on your Google account.” In other words, while photo and video storage currently does not count against your total of 15 free gigs on a Google account, it will as of this coming June 1st — along with your Gmail, Google Drive files, and other stored data. Once you hit that 15GB wall, you will have to buy into the Google One service to increase your storage capacity. (Unless you own a Pixel, in which case you still have no limits on “high quality” photos.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTbl7b"&gt;If you’re a Google Photos user who finds all of this a bit irritating, you may be thinking of leaving. But first, it’s a good idea to check out your alternatives. Below are some of the main photo storage services available to you, along with their basic fees, so you can figure out whether you want to switch. (Note: We’ve only included services that are specifically geared toward photos, not more general storage services such as OneDrive or Dropbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chKhYl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXH35MCZPB-qOWTZMXZFKj3STjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504078/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_9.57.42_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qoZVjQ"&gt;Google provides each of its accounts with 15GB of free storage. However, for the last few years, photos have been treated differently: under its “high quality” plan, Google stored an unlimited number of photos for free as long as you allow them to be compressed to 16 megapixels. (According to Google, photos that size can be printed without issue up to 24 x 16 inches.) Videos were kept to a maximum of 1080p. (Data such as closed captions could be eliminated to save space.) “Original quality” photos — those that were not compressed — were not part of this unlimited plan but were counted as regular files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5YwJy"&gt;However, all of that is changing. As mentioned above, starting on June 1st, 2021, Google will be including photos in its storage calculations. Once you hit that 15GB ceiling, you will have to buy into the &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;Google One service&lt;/a&gt; for additional storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVXGQL"&gt;Google One currently starts at 100GB of storage for $1.99 a month ($19.99 a year) and proceeds to 200GB for $2.99 a month ($29.99 a year) or 2TB for $9.99 a month ($99.99 a year). The 2TB plan also comes with a VPN for Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxaryX"&gt;Before you run to invest in Google One, be aware that there are several mitigating factors Google is offering its users. When the new plan goes into effect, that is when the clock starts; photos you uploaded before then won’t count toward your 15GB limit. Also, if you’re a Pixel owner, then you can continue to upload high-quality photos without affecting your 15GB limit. (Of course, Pixel owners used to get unlimited original quality for free, rather than having to upload their photos in “high quality.” But hey, it’s something.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTIED4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/photos"&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iCloud Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OhHlPR3hHSzYXLHM4BHWLPypgyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045506/Screen_Shot_2020_11_16_at_9.50.00_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iCloud Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gIMWLM"&gt;If you’re part of Apple’s ecosystem, then you have easy access to iCloud Photos, Apple’s equivalent to Google Photos. iCloud Photos is connected to the Phone app on your Mac or iOS device as a backup for your photos. You automatically get 5GB of storage space associated with your iCloud account; after that, it costs 99 cents per month for 50GB, $2.99 per month for 200GB, and $9.99 per month for 2TB. (This is for the US; &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"&gt;other countries have different fees&lt;/a&gt;.) Windows users can also access iCloud Photos via an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283"&gt;associated app&lt;/a&gt;; Android users will have to access it using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yZr3Oh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Flickr page" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rs5L-CTH_oyitP0u2yut9q5965c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13692625/flickr_interface.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flickr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0WoADA"&gt;Flickr has a free plan as well, but it’s limited to 1,000 photos — within certain guidelines: photo files are limited to 200MB and video files to 1GB. For &lt;a href="https://help.flickr.com/pricing-faq-r1qHsTEbU"&gt;unlimited storage without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you pay either $6.99 a month or $59.99 annually (plus tax). Other advantages to a paid annual membership include stats about which of your photos are trending and a variety of discounts from several companies, including Adobe and SmugMug (which is now part of Flickr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BrJgci"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smugmug.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21561171%2Fphoto-storage-service-google-amazon-flickr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmugMug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Smugmug" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8w07DX4OmmluqYJWke4hyZfYgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22032766/smugmug.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: SmugMug&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmugMug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mH6JCv"&gt;Speaking of SmugMug, this long-lasting service is also available, offering storage, portfolios, and sales opportunities for professionals. For $55 a year or $7 a month, you get unlimited uploads and a customizable website. The Power plan ($85 a year or $11 monthly) adds site customization and your own domain name. If you’re looking to be a professional photographer, the Portfolio plan adds e-commerce features for $200 a year or $27 a month (you keep 85 percent of the markup). And finally, the Pro plan lets you create events, price lists, and branded orders, among other features, for $360 a year or $42 a month. If you’re interested in trying it out, you can get a two-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m3pftc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://500px.com/"&gt;500px&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="500px" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OvSPHukZyZ_L03o3HavAkQfYvd8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22045546/500px_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: 500px&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;500px&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YKFo5I"&gt;Canadian company 500px is actually more for professional photographers than your average snap-and-save picture taker. It offers pros a place to store, exhibit, and license their work. So if you have ambitions to start peddling your photos, 500px may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oJbxb"&gt;The site offers two paid plans. The first, modestly named Awesome, offers unlimited uploads, priority support, no ads, a history of “liked” photos, gallery slideshows, and a profile badge for $59.88 a year or $4.99 monthly. The Pro plan adds a way to display your services and organization tools for $119.88 a year or $9.99 monthly. (You get a discount on your first year: Awesome costs $47.88 a year or $3.99 monthly, while Pro goes for $71.88 a year or $5.99 monthly.) And if you want to make a bit of money, you can submit your photos to be licensed for stock usage through 500px. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67i7IV"&gt;There is a free ad-supported plan that gives you seven uploads a week. When you sign up, you can try out the Pro plan for two weeks before committing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZgbkNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.photobucket.com/explore"&gt;Photobucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photobucket" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRnWvdW4CSwYhI3v_juEr5ai-1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504081/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.54.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photobucket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fui9Kk"&gt;Photobucket offers a limited free plan, allowing you to upload up to 250 photos for free — more a trial plan than anything else. If you like what you see, you can start with the Beginner plan at $5.99 per month or $64.68 annually, which gives you 25GB of storage, along with no ads, password-protected album sharing, and an image editor. For $7.99 per month or $86.28 annually, the Intermediate plan provides 250GB of storage and unlimited image hosting. Finally, for $12.99 per month or $140.28 annually, the Expert plan offers unlimited storage and no image compression, among other extras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1bm9gL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z7uIFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/"&gt;DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt; calls itself “the world’s largest art community” with a social network for visual artists of all kinds. It offers visitors a wide range of artist galleries to view, divided into categories such as traditional, animation, and illustrations. DeviantArt (or DA for short) even has its own publishing platform called Sta.sh — emphasizing the fact that this site, like 500px, is less for simple storage and more for showing (and selling) your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YBRVT"&gt;With a free membership in DeviantArt, there are no restrictions on how much you upload for public access, and you get admission to DA’s community of artists and art lovers. &lt;a href="https://www.deviantart.com/core-membership/"&gt;Core Members enjoy additional perks&lt;/a&gt;. For $3.95 a month or $39.95 a year, you get to sell your art with no service fee (but a 20 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales) and a $100 max price per digital item, along with 20GB of private storage space in Sta.sh. For $7.95 a month or $79.95 a year, you can charge up to $1,000 per item and pay a 12 percent fee on Premium Gallery &amp;amp; Premium download sales, along with 30GB of private storage. Finally, $14.95 a month or $149.95 a year lets you charge up to $10,000 per item, lowers your fee to 10 percent fee per sale, and gets you 50GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iBQOi3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage"&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon Photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uyGvuT12uD0xtAZPBYAG3hjy6Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504092/Screen_Shot_2021_05_10_at_10.58.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Photos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRZOow"&gt;Amazon provides its Prime members with a grab bag of extras along with the free shipping. In addition to the video offerings, music streaming, and other goodies, you get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos"&gt;unlimited photo storage&lt;/a&gt; for $119 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzQzPt"&gt;A nice perk is that you can share that unlimited storage with five friends or family members in what is called the Family Vault. Everything there is accessible to everyone who shares the Vault. “Unlimited,” by the way, does not include videos or other files; for those, Prime members get 5GB of storage, and after that, there is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/photos/storage/plans"&gt;a long list of storage plans&lt;/a&gt; available starting from $1.99 a month for 100GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJVY1"&gt;That’s something to keep in mind if you drop your Prime membership. In that case, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201480950"&gt;according to the Amazon instructions&lt;/a&gt;, “the unlimited photo storage benefits associated with the membership end. All uploaded photos count toward your Amazon Drive storage limit.” The total storage for non-Prime members (stills and video) is 5GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqq6cZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 12th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include SmugMug and to explain that it only covers photo-specific services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rH9748"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 16th, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add iCloud Photos and to update the prices and screenshot for 500px.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose gets into hearing aid business with new FDA-cleared SoundControl hearing aids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A pair of hands holding a small case with Bose hearing aids inside." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UnGkLyzIMH-_r7YioI72PC9ToLM=/0x29:823x578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269707/Screen_Shot_2021_05_11_at_12.10.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose SoundControl hearing aids.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bose&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9iQt2Q"&gt;Bose &lt;a href="https://globalpressroom.bose.com/us-en/pressrelease/view/2111"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it will begin selling direct-to-consumer SoundControl hearing aids for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss on May 18th. They’ll cost $849.95 and will be sold directly by Bose in five states — Massachusetts, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas — before they’re available nationally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETt8mA"&gt;The hearing aids are meant to be fit and controlled by the wearer without needing to see an audiologist for a hearing test and professional fitting. They use standard hearing aid batteries that Bose says will last up to four days if used 14 hours a day. Volume, treble and bass, and modes for different listening environments can be adjusted and preset in the Bose Hear app on iOS or Android. There’s a “Focus” feature with different settings, including a “Front” setting for filtering noise in busy rooms and an “Everywhere” setting that allows all sounds during walks outside or around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A smartphone propped next to the Bose hearing aids. On the phone’s screen is a page that shows scrolling sliders for adjusting World Volume on the left and Treble and Bass on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q1LGnsuVEBNJ3Gavak5U-dNnN-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506841/Bose_SoundControl__Hearing_Aids_with_Bose_Hear_App_2111_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volume and bass / treble adjustment in the Bose Hear app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p5vU5K"&gt;“In the United States alone, approximately 48 million people suffer from some degree of hearing loss that interferes with their life. But the cost and complexity of treatment have become major barriers to getting help,” said Brian Maguire, category director of Bose Hear, in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz84yt"&gt;Prescription hearing aids can cost several thousand dollars and are rarely fully covered by insurance. Less costly personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) are sold in stores, but they aren’t as effective or adjustable as hearing aids and aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The SoundControl hearing aids are the first to be authorized by the FDA for use without assistance from a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1F0rb"&gt;An older design for Bose hearing aids with “self-fitting technology” was &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-allows-marketing-first-self-fitting-hearing-aid-controlled-user"&gt;cleared by the FDA&lt;/a&gt; through De Novo classification in 2018, meaning it’s a low-risk product, and there are no direct-to-consumer devices like it on the market. That design had a neckband and a rechargeable battery like &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_wellness_support/hearphones.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose’s Hearphones&lt;/a&gt;, a hearing amplifier that was &lt;a href="https://www.seniorliving.org/hearing-aids/bose/"&gt;discontinued last year&lt;/a&gt;. The new design looks more like traditional hearing aids, with a receiver behind the ear and a small tip that sits in the ear canal, and was &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K211008"&gt;cleared by the FDA&lt;/a&gt; last week based on substantial equivalence to the 2018 De Novo authorization. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung won’t physically attend Mobile World Congress 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ezmLRqcs1IDwwHnoP_QeGiz9_f0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269623/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLp3y9"&gt;Samsung representatives won’t show up in person to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-will-attend-barcelonas-world-mobile-congress-remotely-la-vanguardia-2021-05-11/"&gt;a statement obtained by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it has “made the decision to withdraw from exhibiting in-person” and will instead attend remotely to prioritize the health and safety of its customers and employees. Samsung has yet to announce what its remote presence will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMKwuD"&gt;The in-person event is still scheduled to happen in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and difficulties with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421558/us-covid-coronavirus-vaccines-patent-waiver"&gt;vaccination availability outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. The GSM Association, which organizes the event, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;fought against shutting down last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; early on in 2020 before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;several big brands dropped out&lt;/a&gt;. This year, we’ve already seen Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;announce that it won’t be exhibiting&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to Samsung’s remote announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2zZY"&gt;We’ve reached out to several other large brands about their attendance plans, including ZTE, Huawei, Sony, and Lenovo. None were immediately available for comment, but we’ll update this article if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is reportedly pulling a Facebook and adding in-app shopping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ly8oGOnMH-fhcstTfoE89EJxeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269572/acastro_190402_3308_Guide_TikTok_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aogItH"&gt;TikTok’s next move to compete with Facebook might be to add an in-app shopping feature, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication writes that TikTok is testing in-app sales in Europe by partnering with several brands, including UK-based streetwear company Hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkbyNY"&gt;TikTok’s made some shopping moves in the past, like giving creators the ability to sell merchandise through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408539/tiktok-teespring-merchandise-apparel-commerce-monetization"&gt;an integration with Teespring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://news.shopify.com/dancing-to-a-new-beat-shopify-brings-commerce-to-tiktok"&gt;partnering with Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, and reportedly working on some kind of &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-live-stream-shopping-feature-in-app-purchases-2021-2"&gt;live-video informercial product&lt;/a&gt;. This new prototype sounds more like how shopping’s been integrated on Instagram, with a separate shopping tab under a brand’s account that lists products with images and prices, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Il4KSZfDn9ZqgVML4J7IWWAc1ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506865/TikTok_Shopping.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hype account page on TikTok shows what looks like a shopping tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="engzTb"&gt;The Hype account page currently does show what looks like a shopping section (though it’s blank for my US account) and the company did confirm to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that it was participating in the test. We’ve also reached out to TikTok for further confirmation the shopping test is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIBFv"&gt;Shopping and TikTok seem like they could have a real peanut butter and jelly type of relationship. The bite-sized length and “stickiness” of TikTok videos seem perfectly suited for advertising, while the passive watching that TikTok encourages (at least in me) makes it easy to consume a lot of content. So far, this shopping prototype doesn’t sound quite as video-focused as whatever informercial-style feature TikTok was previously considering, but I wouldn’t be too surprised to see links to the hypothetical shopping tab littered throughout a brand or creator’s videos at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx7LMd"&gt;It’s also more or less exactly what Facebook’s on its way to doing with Instagram, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165957/instagram-reels-shopping-update-global"&gt;TikTok competitor Reels&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399858/facebook-shop-app-update-sell-product-instagram"&gt;the normal Facebook app&lt;/a&gt; itself. The company went on a slightly different kind of shopping spree in 2020, adding commerce functionality like the previously mentioned shopping tab, product information in Reels, and it hasn’t stopped there. Facebook is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323398/facebook-stories-ads-stickers-creator-monetize-update"&gt;testing sticker ads&lt;/a&gt; in Stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqf6jE"&gt;Wherever TikTok lands with shopping, tests like these seem to show the viral video app is ready to take advantage of its status as a household name and grow — whether it’s shopping or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22422980/tiktok-log-in-sound-kit-app-integration-developers"&gt;spreading TikTok features across other apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter is the new name of Project CHIP, the partnership that promises to simplify your smart home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epha63qFJ9tZiyXSdZwKbEQHEpg=/249x0:1881x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269556/matter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yym2p2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427139/amazon-apple-google-zigbee-alliance-open-source-smart-home-standard-2021-launch"&gt;Project Connected Home over IP (CHIP)&lt;/a&gt; — the ambitious smart home partnership that will see Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, the Zigbee Alliance, and dozens of other companies work together on an open standard — has gotten a new name: Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCp9iP"&gt;The rebranding comes ahead of the first Matter certifications, which are set to arrive before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387252/project-chip-will-finally-ship-later-this-year"&gt;the end of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The new branding and logo are designed to help make it easier for customers to tell which devices work with Matter’s unified system, with the logo set to appear on future hardware products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-v7LDftjLpwcTSLmERNUBtqukyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506925/Matter_Smart_Bulb.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="03T3RD"&gt;The goal of Matter is deceptively simple: make sure you’re able to use your smart home devices with the voice assistant (or assistants) of choice, whether that’s Apple’s Siri / HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. At launch, Matter will run on Ethernet Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth Low Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLRZUM"&gt;Other big companies, like Philips Hue, are on board: the company has already promised to release a simple software update in the coming months that will make all of its past and present products compatible with Matter once it launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2phxrb"&gt;It’s an ambitious goal, which could vastly simplify the confusing parts of smart home setup — assuming companies are willing to put in the work to issue software updates and integrate the standard into their current and future products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Mpwn"&gt;As part of the announcement, the Zigbee Alliance (which created the Zigbee standard for interconnected smart home gadgets) has announced that it’ll rename itself to the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) as it expands to focus more on projects like Matter in addition to the existing Zigbee network.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PRO Act would reshape the tech industry — will it get the chance?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers First Address To Joint Session Of Congress" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5XbyuM3hyRxQPZEZwr8xDu3GD0=/0x0:2934x1956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269537/1232585550.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rb0J2"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) is holding a hearing this week to contest the results of the Amazon union election. Organizers say the retail giant interrogated employees, spread anti-union propaganda, and held captive audience meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hF1IQ9"&gt;These tactics might seem dirty, but most aren’t explicitly illegal. “According to the letter of the law, workers have the right to organize, but it doesn’t pan out that way in practice,” says Kelly Russo, an organizer with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 2. “Labor laws are weak or have loopholes that allow employers to dissuade people from forming a union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJaNIH"&gt;The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 was meant to defend worker organizing. But the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947 poked holes in many of its protections. The legislation allowed states to pass right-to-work laws, forcing unions to represent workers who don’t pay dues, which weakens their position financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gpSxT"&gt;Now, Congress is considering a law that would dramatically reshape American labor. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act (also known as the PRO Act) would eliminate many of the roadblocks that workers face when they try to unionize. Among other things, it would ban companies from forcing employees to attend captive audience meetings where managers spread anti-union messages; allow unions to collect dues from non-union members — increasing their budgets and their ability to effectively organize; and establish penalties for companies that violate workers’ rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NriN9J"&gt;“The PRO Act is the most significant piece of labor legislation since the New Deal,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings. “It really addresses the ways that workers’ rights to organize have been eroded, which is why we see these huge misinformation campaigns and well-funded propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LGLen"&gt;The bill would have massive implications for tech companies that have faced few consequences for union busting. After the Bessemer election, RWDSU accused Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/union-appeals-amazon-election-in-complaint-claiming-misconduct?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;of firing an organizer for handing out union cards&lt;/a&gt;. This is illegal under current labor law. But even if it were proved true, the punishment for Amazon would be minimal. “There is no repercussion, essentially,” Dubal says. “A worker would have to file an Unfair Labor Practice charge, then they wait for months and months to find out if they were illegally fired. And then the only power that the state has to enforce this is to say, ‘Look, Amazon, you have to reinstate the worker and you have to put a sign up in the break room that says that you broke the law.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BInsfC"&gt;The PRO Act could also impact the Alphabet Workers Union, which launched in early January. The union is open to contractors as well as white collar workers — making NLRB recognition nearly impossible. Under the PRO Act, that might change. The law reshapes the test for determining who is an independent contractor. “It would make it much easier for a lot of people who are misclassified right now as independent contractors to organize,” Dubal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMR3uY"&gt;It’s for that reason that Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart have spent at least $1,190,000 on lobbying efforts to influence the bill, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/05/06/pro-act-uber-lyft-doordash-instacart-lobbying/"&gt;according to reporting in &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Uber has said that the possibility of drivers unionizing could pose a business risk, writing in its 2020 financial filing: “If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWfBGm"&gt;The PRO Act passed the House on March 9th, 2021. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he’d bring the legislation to the floor for a vote if supporters rallied 50 co-sponsors, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/pro-act-labor-senate-vote-filibuster/"&gt;according to reporting in &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But right now that’s unlikely to happen. No Republicans are expected to back the bill, and &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/12/pro-act-mark-kelly-angus-king-dsa/"&gt;prominent Democrats like Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) have been reluctant to voice their support&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJhL5c"&gt;So far, only 47 senators have signed on in support of the measure, leaving the bill far short of the 60 “yes” votes necessary for it to overcome a filibuster. Three Democrats, including Kelly, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), have stayed relatively silent on the sweeping labor legislation, and unions have promised not to support the lawmakers in upcoming elections if they fail to back the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/22/unions-senate-democrats-pro-act-484280"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Labor activists have gone as far as showing up at Warner’s home on Wednesday with a cake to lobby for his support for the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/cake-mark-warner-unions/2021/05/05/f794ad28-ad08-11eb-acd3-24b44a57093a_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oQw7f"&gt;“‘Send me the PRO Act.’ Support the President,” the cake read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS79ES"&gt;With Republicans largely opposed to the legislation, the PRO Act needs every ounce of support possible from Democrats and Independents in order to send it to the president’s desk. Without 60 lawmakers in favor of the legislation, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/6/17/18681798/filibuster-senate-broke-video"&gt;one senator can prevent the bill&lt;/a&gt; from being brought for a vote by prolonging debate on it. “It’s the legacy of slave power. I have no other way to describe the filibuster than that. We need an abolition of this anti-democratic nonsense that prevents real progress,” says Tom Smith, organizing director of the Communications Workers of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5CiV3"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Warner said, “I am concerned about the portion of the bill that deals with worker classification. Many Americans prefer alternative work arrangements that give them the freedom and flexibility to set their own hours or work around their other interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLeLG1"&gt;A spokesperson for Kelly told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he was “evaluating the legislation and speaking about it with stakeholders in Arizona as he focuses on building an economic recovery that benefits working Arizonans who have been hit hard by the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixzO71"&gt;Sinema’s office did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3YELL"&gt;The lack of support from Senate Democrats has been a blow to unions that are hoping the PRO Act will help them regain some of their power. “I think the question for us is ‘are we going to take advantage of this moment or not?’” Smith says. “Are we going to make this another one of those moments in history when tens of millions of workers are able to successfully organize unions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vz0alz"&gt;President Joe Biden has repeatedly touted his support for the PRO Act. In March, he &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/09/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-house-taking-up-the-pro-act/"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the passage of the bill: “As America works to recover from the devastating challenges of deadly pandemic, an economic crisis, and reckoning on race that reveals deep disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZRPbY"&gt;That call was brought up again last month during Biden’s first joint address to Congress. “The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uKxpe"&gt;Organizers hope they’ll get a chance to do so again, noting that the current labor landscape is heavily weighted toward corporations. “The hell scape that workers face when they try to exercise their fundamental human rights, and their freedom of association — it’s just so stacked against them right now,” Smith says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subaru teases its first electric car, the Solterra EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02ZfNYBQlv9wJrmCJ32r7XN1E5w=/1x0:4500x2999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269419/Solterra2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/500px Prime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKuBbo"&gt;Subaru has released a pair of teaser images of its first electric car, which will be called the Solterra EV. Coming to the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan in 2022, it will be powered by the electric vehicle platform that Subaru has been co-developing with fellow Japanese automaker Toyota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0h67Y"&gt;In true teaser fashion, the images don’t show off too much. One, which appears to be more of a rendering than an actual photograph, reveals that the EV will... roughly look similar to Subaru’s other SUVs, though it seems to be on the smaller side. The other is a close-up of the rear badge, with a subtle splash of mud as a nod toward Subaru’s outdoorsy bona fides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLomWH"&gt;That’s basically all Subaru is saying for now, though. No pricing, no specs, and no information about whether Subaru will use the Solterra as a chance to refresh the way it designs its vehicle interiors (as many other automakers have with their first electric vehicles). Pretty much the only other detail Subaru shared is that the name “was created using the Latin words for ‘Sun’ and ‘Earth’ to represent Subaru’s commitment to deliver traditional SUV capabilities in an environmentally responsible package” — which, as far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18200592/driver-assistance-adas-names-aaa-report"&gt;corporate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://schwindter.substack.com/p/semantic-drain-and-the-meaninglessness#:~:text=The%20gradual%20creep%20of%20jargon,of%20just%20a%20few%20years.&amp;amp;text=It's%20not%20the%20word's%20fault."&gt;naming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/12/22380114/kyndryl-ibm-it-spinoff-name-infrastructure-branding"&gt;conventions&lt;/a&gt; go, is kind of refreshingly harmonic, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/04/20/all-electric-subaru-evoltis-with-oddball-design-to-be-unveiled-in-2021/"&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/subaru-of-america-is-being-super-lame-right-now-about-t-1840971831?utm_source=jalopnik_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialflow&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow_jalopnik_twitter"&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac52f4"&gt;Solterra is certainly more pleasing to the eyes than “BZ4X,” which is the name of the first SUV Toyota &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;will build on this shared platform with Subaru&lt;/a&gt;. The BZ4X is also due out in 2022 and will be built on this shared platform, which Toyota calls the e-TNGA and Subaru calls e-Subaru (which is not so harmonic). The companies have said that the vehicles built on this platform will benefit from Subaru’s experience with making really good all-wheel drive systems and Toyota’s years of developing battery tech for its hybrids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPzcJB"&gt;As thin as the press release is, being able to talk about Subaru’s first EV never felt like a total given. Along with Toyota, Subaru has avoided making a splashy or expensive transition to electric vehicles during a time when most every other automaker took the leap. The company’s slow approach has, at best, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-show-scant-interest-in-electric-vehicles-subaru-ceo-says-11579520427"&gt;seemed like a sober read of the current market&lt;/a&gt; and, at worst, seemed out of touch — like when it advertised its all-wheel drive technology as a “great opportunity to cope with recent climate change” in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamshack24/status/1201239098482016256/photo/1"&gt;a since-deleted press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox’s Quick Resume feature gets new group option in May update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsbJT3olWFZiQRUImQVbtdygQt8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269385/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oNwJ58"&gt;The Xbox Series X / S’s handy Quick Resume feature, which suspends supported games so that they boot up more quickly when you come back to them later, is getting some nice improvements in the May Xbox update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbvVHo"&gt;Once the update is installed on your console, you’ll be able to see which games are kept in Quick Resume with a new tag, and you’ll also be able to make a group of games in Quick Resume so you have access to all of them in a single spot. Microsoft is also promising that Quick Resume will have “improved reliability and faster load times,” Microsoft’s Jonathan Hildebrandt &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/05/11/may-2021-xbox-update/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pzcs_eESR65k93MCaC8_kQ-Gxps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506842/Quick_Resume_Spotlight.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Quick Resume group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nYeSMR"&gt;The new update also adds passthrough audio for media apps like Disney Plus and Apple TV, meaning that audio from those apps can be sent directly to a compatible HDMI device. There are also new parental settings that let parents unblock multiplayer mode for individual games and a new dynamic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKT0Zg"&gt;The May update should be rolling out now, and it might already be available for you. While writing this story, I booted up my Series X and it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFccDl"&gt;Microsoft also announced that it will be sunsetting the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-one-smartglass%2F9wzdncrfhvx2%3Frtc%3D1%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox One SmartGlass app for PC&lt;/a&gt; starting in June. “This means the SmartGlass app will be removed from the Windows Store and there will be no further updates for those who have the app already downloaded to their devices,” Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;
