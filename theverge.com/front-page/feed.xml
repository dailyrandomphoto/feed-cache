    <title>GM envisions electric vehicles with 600 miles of range with new battery research center</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOxxbIJIyn55NPMWyk6qqRUz6EY=/366x0:4299x2622/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952803/01___SW_w_Building_Sign___2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3CZXK1"&gt;General Motors is building a new 300,000-square-foot battery research facility in Michigan to help it realize its mission of building electric vehicle batteries that are longer-lasting, quicker to charge, and more sustainable for the environment. Through this new center, GM is setting the stage for a battery breakthrough that will help it build electric vehicles that can travel as much as 600 miles on a single charge — roughly twice the range of most EVs on the road today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzKEL6"&gt;The new facility will be named the Wallace Battery Innovation Center after Bill Wallace, a battery engineer at GM who died in 2018. The center will be located in Warren, Michigan, near the campus of the automaker’s 710-acre Technical Center in Southeast Michigan. GM wouldn’t disclose the number of engineers that will eventually fill the center’s labs, nor would it say much money it would cost to build, but expects it to be in the “hundreds of millions of dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j1YigR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“large format prototype cells, up to a meter wide or even wider”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eno6pz"&gt;The innovation center will be “one of the only ones in North America that can use large format prototype cells, up to a meter wide or even wider than that, with uniform stacked electrodes,” said Ken Morris, vice president for electric and autonomous vehicles at GM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiCeEa"&gt;The goal is to produce batteries with an energy density of “up to 1,200 watt-hours per liter,” Morris said — a staggering number that &lt;a href="https://themobilist.medium.com/gm-claims-its-on-the-verge-of-commercializing-the-most-exotic-battery-chemistry-of-all-a310254fd1e2"&gt;some experts have questioned&lt;/a&gt;. “And that means that you can easily have a 500- or a 600-mile vehicle on a single charge that’s possible, creating a new reality for our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqfKWr"&gt;That would be beyond the range advertised for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium battery architecture&lt;/a&gt;, which the company has said would allow for driving ranges of “400 miles or more.” When they were first announced, GM said that it would design its Ultium batteries to be large-format, pouch-style cells, compared to cylindrical cells that are used by Tesla and others. This enables them to be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack, as the automaker sees fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfFkUg"&gt;“With these high-energy-density, low-cost vehicles, we really think we can have a better package that’s less mass, better for the vehicle, better for the customer, and it can be the reality as quickly as we can through the Wallace Innovation Center,” Morris added. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pPyAF61NhHAeMTJF9j6sZ9Vot1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900939/07___Aerial_SW_w_Building_Sign___2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mJ1VGb"&gt;The first generation of Ultium batteries will make their debut in the Hummer EV pickup truck, which is scheduled to go into production next year. The Wallace Center is being set up to develop future versions that will be completely different from the current lithium-ion composition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUBJNv"&gt;“The Wallace Center is going to be a colocation of development engineers, research engineers, and manufacturing engineers, where we’re going to accelerate this next generation,” Morris said. “Technology like lithium metal or pure silicon anodes, even solid-state batteries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnMjCl"&gt;The innovation center is not a battery manufacturing facility — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;GM is building two of those with partner LG Chem&lt;/a&gt; — but it will be set up for pilot assembly lines so the automaker can experiment with different production methods. Other projects will include intellectual property that’s being developed under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325241/gm-electric-vehicle-battery-range-cost-solid-energy"&gt;a joint venture between GM and SolidEnergy Systems&lt;/a&gt;, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is focused on improving the energy density in lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSmL5q"&gt;GM grew to be the largest automaker in North America on the back of combustion engines. Now, it needs to ramp up production of electric vehicles in order to become a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;carbon neutral company by the year 2040&lt;/a&gt; and meet its goal to halt sales of light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2035. Having a ready supply of batteries is, therefore, a fundamental concern for GM’s future. The company had already vowed to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025 and even redesigned its logo to look more like an electrical plug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9s get new look and features in OxygenOS 12 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Igjpap2aW3dgzQiRZWP61guC9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949662/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZspA1"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;OnePlus is a sub-brand of the Oppo family&lt;/a&gt;, the two companies not only merged their R&amp;amp;D departments in early 2021, but they are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;consolidating code for their two Android-based operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. While OxygenOS 12 will be used on global OnePlus phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;ColorOS 12 will only be on China-only&lt;/a&gt; Oppo and OnePlus phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2pODX"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;Android 12 to AOSP today&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus is releasing the first open beta of OxygenOS 12 to the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro now, while those with older models will have to wait for a later update. Once this version is deemed stable, it is likely a full version will be released within a month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;according to XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p4SNh5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="479hSr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3mUnD"&gt;The new and improved OxygenOS 12 is colorful and minimalist like “&lt;a href="https://jamesturrell.com/"&gt;James Turrell’s&lt;/a&gt; Light and Space artwork,” as explained &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-12-open-beta-1-for-oneplus-9-series.1502946/"&gt;in its forum post&lt;/a&gt; announcing this release. OxygenOS 12 shares some of the same design languages as ColorOS 12 and Android 12 by extension. All three OSes make liberal use of white space, as well as large sans-serif typography to “enhance readability and ease of use.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoGgdw"&gt;OxygenOS 12 also follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Material You aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, where the new icons use simple lines, and new widgets use shapes to make information and actions more clear and accessible to a diverse group of users. Just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679087/oppo-oneplus-coloros-12-update-announced-release-date"&gt;ColorOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus software is enhanced with more shadows and subtle gradients to give OxygenOS 12 a more premium look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QM3BN5-sJCAvznQ-UQDo0IcSwac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900111/darkmodes_3up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OxygenOS 12 offers three levels of Dark Mode to give you more control over your phone’s UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="orGxgt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hviAhT"&gt;In addition to its new look, OxgyenOS 12 also learned some new tricks to improve your experience with OnePlus phones. If you’ve been playing with the developer preview of Android 12 on the OnePlus 9 series, you’ll be happy to know these features have made it into the open beta of OxygenOS 12:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t5RKxn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Private Safe&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature isolates sensitive files to a secured part of your phone, where you can safely store and protect specific photos, videos, audios, and documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yprYw6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Updated OnePlus Shelf &amp;amp; OnePlus Scout&lt;/strong&gt;: The handy Shelf has been enhanced with even more widgets: from notes, step counting, weather, to the calculator, according to &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-dp-2-oneplus-9-pro-oxygenos/"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;. You can even search for anything on your phone using OnePlus Scout, which is now part of the Shelf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WDehnM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Zen Mode &amp;amp; World Life Balance 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt; First popularized by OnePlus’ Indian users, both modes help you manage work-life balance by separating your personal and work accounts. You can set up different profiles with different Wi-Fi networks, with different app notifications and messages depending on the time of day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1EPmDl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dark Mode:&lt;/strong&gt; This lets you choose between three levels of dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t6WlFY"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note app: &lt;/strong&gt;This updated app now lets you doodle as well as type out your thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9dG93J"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Canvas AOD 2.0: &lt;/strong&gt;The app lets that you create a wireframe image on your lockscreen, based on your wallpaper, is back with more functionality. It now includes more brushes and lines for you to use, as well as more photos and effects available to support your artistic vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="dY7zR8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10789206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nDAAI"&gt;It’s possible that this is the end of the road for OxygenOS, as the two companies could more fully integrate their software into one, rather than maintain two OSes. If that’s the case, OnePlus will hopefully be able to bring some of its most popular features like the Canvas AOD 2.0 and Work Life Balance 2.0 mode to future ColorOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxTi9w"&gt;If you have a OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro and want to try out this open beta of OxygenOS 12, then head to &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-12-open-beta-1-for-the-oneplus-9-and-oneplus-9-pro.1502946/"&gt;OnePlus’ community forum page&lt;/a&gt; to download it onto your computer, and follow the instructions to install the software onto your OnePlus phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxpzMs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:30AM, October 5th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Updated download link to new location for the update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Ryzen 5000-equipped MateBook 16 is getting a global release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/78dM6rTuThHbhhRdaK0kygHwH_c=/0x0:723x482/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952687/huawei_matebook_16_kv.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0vx91c"&gt;Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fmatebook-16%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22702083%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-ryzen-5000-laptop-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MateBook 16&lt;/a&gt;, a laptop that combines a large 16-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio and a Ryzen 5000 series processor, is getting a global launch. The laptop was first announced for the &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/05/20/huawei-matebook-16-with-32-display-amd-ryzen-7-5800h-and-84wh-battery-launched/"&gt;Chinese market in May&lt;/a&gt; but will shortly be launching globally with prices starting at the equivalent of €1,099 (around $1,274) for the Ryzen 5 model, and €1,199 (around $1,390) for the Ryzen 7 version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o995vR"&gt;Huawei calls the MateBook 16 its “first high-performance notebook” thanks to it being configurable with AMD’s latest Ryzen 5000 series laptop processors. There’s a choice of either a Ryzen 5800H or a 5600H, paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of NVMe storage. Connectivity specs include Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vkA5kS_52XGPIpIld3Z_2ULXdP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890054/huawei_matebook_16_overview_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MateBook 16’s 16-inch 2520 x 1680 display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RLGjDC"&gt;The MateBook 16’s display is a 16-inch IPS panel with a 2520 x 1680 resolution, which works out to a 3:2 aspect ratio (our preference for productivity laptops). Around the screen you’ll find a typically thin Huawei laptop bezel, helped by the fact that its 720p webcam is hidden inside the keyboard. If Huawei’s previous laptops are anything to go by, that’s likely to be great for keeping the screen bezels small but could make for a terrible nostril-focused angle for video calls. There’s also a fingerprint sensor built into the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byHFwZ"&gt;Ports include two USB-A sockets, two USB-C, a full-size HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Charging the laptop’s 84Wh battery is handled via an included 135W USB-C power adaptor. Other features include dual mics and dual front-firing 2W speakers, as well as Huawei Share support that lets you do things like mirror a Huawei phone’s screen and control it via the laptop, or use a paired tablet as a drawing surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bm54cl"&gt;Huawei did not provide release dates or markets prior to publication, but confirmed that the laptop will initially be available in “select markets in Western Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU09vW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRpXAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch HBO’s teaser trailer for Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SPpnoEUivKzqpX8etlnVxTXg2O8=/216x0:2673x1638/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952561/Screenshot_2021_10_05_at_18.55.58.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y9t7Zc"&gt;HBO has released a teaser trailer containing the first real footage of &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; prequel series. The show was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20939230/game-of-thrones-spinofff-series-house-of-the-dragons-ordered-hbo-max"&gt;announced two years ago&lt;/a&gt; and is based on George R. R. Martin’s &lt;em&gt;Fire and Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a book that centers around the history of the Targaryen family and is set two centuries before the events of the &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; novels, which &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; was based on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syjMA1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; trailer doesn’t reveal much about the show’s plot beats, but does demonstrate its impressive cast: actors including Paddy Considine, Matt Smith, Sonoya Mizuno, Steve Toussaint, Rhys Ifans, and Olivia Cooke are all on board. As you’d expect, there appears to be a lot of sword fighting and references to dragons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6k6LQk"&gt;The question, of course, is how many &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; fans will return for &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; considering how the former show’s final season proved to be, shall we say, divisive — not least because of the writing of a certain character with the surname “Targaryen.” HBO hasn’t given a specific release date other than to say that &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; will air in 2022, and it will of course be on the HBO Max streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat launches Run for Office portal to encourage users toward political campaigns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C01TwWhKN2v5M_a4oLyhv-jycR8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952508/RFO_Partner_Assets__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat has introduced tools to help users run for office | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gd3NVR"&gt;Snapchat is launching a new tool aimed at guiding its young user base to consider running for political office. The company says it wants to help potential future candidates deal with common barriers to launching political campaigns by providing information, resources, and encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6U6tOA"&gt;The Run for Office Mini — a set of miniature applications that run within Snapchat — will let Snapchat users explore issues they care about and find information about political offices in their ZIP code. They’ll be able to connect to candidate recruitment organizations, including &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://runforsomething.net/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6ee8i21k6A%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run for Something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.newpolitics.org/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6ecR_BzCmQ%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.rungenz.com/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6efzEFLVzg%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run GenZ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://victoryinstitute.org/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6ecLT22vIg%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LGBTQ Victory Institute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can provide training and resources to prepare for a campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8mhOc"&gt;The tool has a portal based on BallotReady’s API that lets Snapchat users find issues important to them and includes information about 75,000 upcoming elections on the federal, state, and local levels. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47wBQTe-7DU_QFxLcamY7Wa9VRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900867/Issues_Screen_2.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nFChow"&gt;Once the user picks the issues they’re most interested in, the app will surface potential roles that might be a fit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JiSE6tKeYjDO1yWMdw0RqBTBTkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900859/School_Board_Position.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a potential role for a Snapchat user thinking about running for office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2KgyI"&gt;The tool also includes a campaign dashboard to show Snap users what steps they need to take to get on a ballot, including any filing deadlines or signature requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oz8HexK1_UkiF3ypNfliGifgh_c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900872/My_Campaign.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mMMTH9"&gt;And, they’ll be able to share stickers from the portal to “campaign” within the app and share their candidacy with friends in Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UGbPGIi-iNFZVcD9AruqCso2seM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900890/Sticker_Example_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jBbCK4"&gt;Users will also be able to “nominate” friends who they see as future leaders and encourage them to run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKdpZg"&gt;This isn’t Snapchat’s first foray into get-out-the-vote efforts; in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/25/17899984/snapchat-voter-registration-2018-midterm-elections-turbovote"&gt;2018, it added voter registration&lt;/a&gt; within its app, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357023/snapchat-voter-tools-election-app-registration"&gt;2020, the company introduced more in-app features&lt;/a&gt;, including a voter guide and voting checklist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuDSS7"&gt;The company said it helped more than 1.2 million of its users register to vote in 2020, and half of those were first-time voters. It estimates that the in-app voter education tools were used by more than 30 million Snapchat users. The company claims to reach 90 percent of 13- to 24-year-olds in the US, and much of that demographic either has yet to vote or was eligible to vote for the first time in the 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PijM8b"&gt;The Run for Office Tool builds on the work Snap has already done, partnering with the Center for Information &amp;amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University’s Tisch College. According to &lt;a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/poll-young-people-believe-they-can-lead-change-unprecedented-election-cycle"&gt;CIRCLE’s research&lt;/a&gt;, this younger, diverse generation wants to lead political change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j397Vc"&gt;“We hope launching the ‘Run for Office’ mini changes the idea of who can be in office — that no matter who you are, where you come from, that you can make a difference in your local community by running for office based on the issues they care most about,” said Sofia Gross, Snap’s head of policy partnerships and social impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dV8Uq0"&gt;She added that the company believes it has an important and long-term role to play in encouraging the next generation of leaders to run for office. “We want to help shape a more reflective and equitable democracy for all Americans, and that includes the Snapchat Generation — we can’t wait to see all they will do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kobo announces two new e-readers, including $260 note-taking Sage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLNuMHVg7ZdZRb-duRUmRFEs2dU=/77x0:890x542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952490/kobo_sage_stylus_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sage can function as a e-note device, with support for the Kobo Stylus ($40, sold separately). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Kobo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bP7XZx"&gt;Kobo has announced a pair of new e-readers: the $260 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-sage&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710302%2Fkobo-e-readers-note-taking-sage-waterproof-libra-2-prices-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kobo Sage&lt;/a&gt;, which is the company’s new top-end device, and the $180 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-libra-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710302%2Fkobo-e-readers-note-taking-sage-waterproof-libra-2-prices-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Libra 2&lt;/a&gt;, an update to its mid-range Libra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUiSs7"&gt;Both devices keep the asymmetrical design popularized by Amazon’s Oasis e-reader, offer E Ink Carta 1200 screens with Kobo’s ComfortLight Pro feature (which adapts the screen brightness and color based on the time of day), and add Bluetooth support for wireless headphones (though they can only play Kobo’s own audiobooks). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUiBJT"&gt;The Sage is the larger of the two and also functions as an e-note device. It’s compatible with the company’s Kobo Stylus (sold separately for $40), which lets users make handwritten notes on ebooks and PDFs that can be can converted to plain text. With an 8-inch (1440 x 1920) E Ink display, this makes the Sage smaller than Kobo’s dedicated e-note slate, the 10.3-inch Elipsa. It’s also cheaper, too, as the Elipsa is priced at $399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PmG6Vn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10790551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TjrvEs"&gt;The Sage also works with Kobo’s new $80 &lt;a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0894/8792/products/PowerCover_Cadmus_Magnetic_EN_521x521.jpg?v=1633343561"&gt;PowerCover&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically wakes and sleeps the device when opened and closed, has a place to keep your stylus, and includes an integrated battery to extend the Sage’s battery life. The Sage has 32GB of non-expandable storage, a quad-core 1.8 GHz processor, and USB-C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uut2p8"&gt;The Libra 2, meanwhile, is an update to the Kobo Libra H20, keeping the IPX8 waterproof design of the former but dropping the “H20” moniker all the same (the Sage is also IPX8 rated, meaning it’s able to survive up to 60 minutes submersion in 2 meters of water). The Libra 2 has a 7-inch display (1264 x 1680) that’s supposedly faster than that of its predecessor. It also has 32GB of non-expandable storage, USB-C, and a 1 GHz processor. It doesn’t support Kobo’s new PowerCover, but does support Kobo’s $40 SleepCover, which wakes and sleeps the device and doubles as a stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WESKJm"&gt;Both devices are available to pre-order and will ship October 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rKvOOb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10790552"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R9bHJ4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will give you free Stadia hardware if you buy a game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Stadia Controller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H9JmcIaPL-LYO0x4cBbQJ9Nkgf4=/43x0:1420x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952482/stadia_controller.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5lNXxA"&gt;Google is giving away a free Stadia Premiere Edition kit if you purchase a regular Stadia game. This hardware bundle includes a Chromecast Ultra and Stadia controller, and you’ll need to buy a full price game ($59.99 or above) to qualify for the offer. &lt;a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/Explore-new-games-with-a-free-Stadia-Premiere-Edition/ba-p/68708"&gt;Google’s free offer&lt;/a&gt; will run until 11:59PM PT on October 10th, and codes will be distributed by October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7HUuY"&gt;The free Stadia Premier Edition offer will run in the US, UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Austria, and Switzerland. Google usually sells its Stadia Premiere Edition for $79.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rrekIF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has been giving away free Stadia hardware over the past year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v0UQ2u"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Google has given away free Stadia hardware. In November Google started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558820/youtube-premium-subscribers-free-stadia-premiere-edition-bundle-deals"&gt;gifting Stadia Premiere Edition kits&lt;/a&gt; to YouTube premium subscribers. If you purchased &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;on Stadia during its launch period in November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;Google also gave away&lt;/a&gt; Stadia Premiere Edition kits. More recently, Google also gave away this same hardware bundle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22340624/resident-evil-village-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-promotion"&gt;purchases of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwJLA4"&gt;While Google insists it’s still committed to Stadia, the writing is on the wall for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;how long the service survives in its current form&lt;/a&gt;. Google decided earlier this year that it doesn’t want to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming"&gt;a game company&lt;/a&gt; anymore, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;it no longer wants to build its own games&lt;/a&gt;. That’s led to a number of high profile departures throughout 2021, including Google’s director of games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665805/google-stadia-jack-buser-games-cloud"&gt;leaving for a position in Google’s cloud team&lt;/a&gt; last month. Google now defines Stadia as a “technology platform for industry partners,” which means the service could eventually transform into a white-label cloud gaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqxjBY"&gt;Despite Google’s Stadia struggles, the service has been improving this year. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575619/google-stadia-revenue-share-developers-games-summit"&gt;recently slashed its revenue share&lt;/a&gt; for developers, added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22624023/stadia-direct-touch-control-scheme-humankind-stadia"&gt;a direct touchscreen control option&lt;/a&gt;, and also launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/31/22603498/google-stadia-controller-chromecast-play-watch-bundle"&gt;Stadia for the Chromecast with Google TV.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla ordered to pay $137 million to former worker over racism and hostile workplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tour of Tesla Factor in Fremont, California" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8to0Hy7d2jF8oifsyrQ4XoBF6Q=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952454/1009397468.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mason Trinca for The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AFDC2x"&gt;A jury in California has ordered Tesla to pay $137 million in damages to a Black former elevator operator after he experienced a hostile work environment, including racial harassment and discrimination, at the company’s Fremont plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cLXri"&gt;Owen Diaz worked at the plant between June 2015 and May 2016 as a contractor, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/tesla-must-pay-137-million-to-ex-worker-over-hostile-work-environment-racism.html"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/04/tesla-discrimination-case/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Diaz told the court that “daily racist epithets” were used in the plant, including the n-word; that racist graffiti and cartoons appeared in his workspace and the toilets; and that he was told to “go back to Africa” by colleagues. Supervisors failed to consistently intervene in these issues, said Diaz, and the stress of the situation caused him to suffer weight loss and “sleepless nights.” As reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-04/tesla-ordered-to-pay-137-million-for-harboring-workplace-racism?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he told the jury: “Some days I would just sit on my stairs and cry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QoXMCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe that’s the largest verdict in an individual race discrimination in employment case”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T0jRB1"&gt;The judgement is unusual for a number of reasons. First, because of the amount of damages awarded by the judge ($130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress). “I believe that’s the largest verdict in an individual race discrimination in employment case,” David Oppenheimer, a clinical professor of law at Berkeley Law, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. And second, because the case took place in an open court at all. Like many Silicon Valley companies, Tesla often forces workers to agree to &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-arbitration-epidemic/#epi-toc-13"&gt;mandatory arbitration&lt;/a&gt; to resolve workplace disputes, meaning they can’t directly sue the company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMBTI0"&gt;Activist Tesla shareholders have complained about the company’s use of arbitration for years, saying it stifles cases like these. “The use of mandatory arbitration provisions limits employees’ remedies for wrongdoing, precludes employees from suing in court when discrimination and harassment occur, and can keep underlying facts, misconduct or case outcomes secret and thereby prevent employees from learning about and acting on shared concerns,” said one group, Nia Impact Capital, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000121465921009522/j913212px14a6g.htm"&gt;recent shareholder proposal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Jr6D"&gt;Despite this, Tesla has faced &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/tesla-factory-racism.html"&gt;numerous allegations&lt;/a&gt; of racial discrimination and harassment at its Fremont plant. Tesla reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611725/tesla-paid-1-million-black-former-employee-racist-slur"&gt;paid $1 million&lt;/a&gt; to another former employee, Melvin Berry, who said he was called the n-word by a supervisor, and the company currently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-racism-unsafe-factory-conditions.html"&gt;faces a class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging racism at the same facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EViLqD"&gt;In response to the verdict in Diaz’s case this week, Tesla’s vice president of people, Valerie Capers Workman, sent an email to employees later published as a &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/regarding-todays-jury-verdict"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Workman says that when Diaz complained about harassment “Tesla stepped in and made sure responsive and timely action was taken,” but acknowledges a number of incidents took place, and notes that “[t]he Tesla of 2015 and 2016 (when Mr. Diaz worked in the Fremont factory) is not the same as the Tesla of today.” Workman did not say whether Tesla plans to appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;citing sources from inside Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176?s=20"&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the gut instinct that “it’s always DNS or BGP.” Facebook is on its way back up, but this all begs the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bSASsz"&gt;What is BGP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qhAt0P"&gt;At a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to &lt;a href="https://blog.cdemi.io/beginners-guide-to-understanding-bgp/"&gt;get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible&lt;/a&gt;. Because there are tons of different internet service providers, backbone routers, and servers responsible for your data making it to, say, Facebook, there’s a ton of different routes your packets could end up taking. BGP’s job is to show them the way and make sure it’s the best route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBANNl"&gt;I’ve heard BGP described as a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;system of post offices&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjkU7Hw2TY4"&gt;air traffic controller&lt;/a&gt;, and more, but I think my favorite explanation was one that likened it to a map. Imagine BGP as a bunch of people making and updating maps that show you how to get to YouTube or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dsS9q9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is like a map telling your computer whose bridges it has to cross to get to Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGE7t8"&gt;When it comes to BGP, the internet is broken up into big networks, known as autonomous systems. You can sort of imagine them as island nations — they’re networks that are controlled by a single entity, which could be an ISP, like Comcast, a company, like Facebook, or some other big organization like a government or major university. It would be extremely difficult to build bridges connecting every island to all the others, so BGP is what’s responsible for telling you which islands (or autonomous systems) you have to go through to get to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVV2vk"&gt;Since the internet is always changing, the maps need to be updated — you don’t want your ISP to lead you down an old road that no longer goes to Google. Because it’d be a massive undertaking to map the entire internet all the time, autonomous systems share their maps. They’ll occasionally talk to their island neighbors to see and copy any updates they’ve made to their maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QFYfuw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turn left into the river&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPwhMP"&gt;Using maps as a framework, it’s easy to imagine how things can go wrong. Back when consumers first got access to GPS, there were always jokes about it having you drive off a cliff or into the middle of the desert. The same thing can happen with BGP — if someone makes a mistake, it can end up leading traffic somewhere it’s not supposed to go, which will cause problems. If it isn’t caught, that mistake will end up on everyone’s map. There are other ways this can go wrong, but we’ll get to those in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tt174N"&gt;Yeah, yeah, maps. Give me an example.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xn2Yhp"&gt;Of course! This is massively simplified, but imagine you want to connect to an imaginary tech news website called Convergence. Convergence uses the ISP NetSend, and you use DecadeConnect. In this example, DecadeConnect and NetSend can’t talk directly to each other, but your ISP can talk to Border Communications, which can talk to Form, which can talk to NetSend. If that’s the only route, then BGP would make sure that you and Convergence could communicate through it. But if alternatively, both DecadeConnect and NetSend were connected to ThirdLevel, BGP would likely choose to route your traffic through it, as it's a shorter hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="k1vLb7"&gt;Okay, so BGP is like maps that detail all the fastest ways from you to a website?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="XJHByP"&gt;Right! Unfortunately, it can get even more complicated because the shortest doesn’t always equal best. There are plenty of reasons why a routing algorithm would choose one path over another — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;cost can be a factor as well&lt;/a&gt;, with some networks charging others if they want to include them in their routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1M9KLB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mapping unchanging roads is hard; imagine mapping the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RKHu1I"&gt;Also, maps are super tricky! I discovered this just recently trying to &lt;a href="https://palousetocascadestrail.org/maps.html"&gt;plan a trip&lt;/a&gt; where roads existed on one map and not another or were different between maps. One road even had three different names across three maps. If it’s that hard to pin down for a “town” that has all of five roads, imagine what it’s like &lt;em&gt;trying to connect the entire internet together&lt;/em&gt;. Real roads don’t change that often, but websites can move from one country to another or change, add, or subtract service providers, and the internet just has to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="3p1hup"&gt;I remember something like this from my algorithms and data structures class — trying to build algos to find the shortest route.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6tUWdq"&gt;I’ll take your word on that. I dropped out as soon as I heard about graphs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqmwFa"&gt;But Facebook didn’t! In fact, it’s built its own BGP system, which lets it do “fast incremental updates,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi21-abhashkumar.pdf"&gt;a paper presented earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the system the company describes there is meant for communication &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; data centers — at this point, it’s hard to say what caused Facebook’s problems on Monday, and it’d take someone smarter than me to say whether Facebook’s datacenter communications could cause this kind of issue. Cybersecurity reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;Bryan Krebs claims&lt;/a&gt; that the outage was caused by a “routine BGP update.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoGOJr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/"&gt;In Facebook’s engineering update&lt;/a&gt;, the company said that the issue was caused by “configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers.” That then led to a “cascading effect on the way [Facebook’s] data centers communicate, bringing [its] services to a halt.” At least to my eye, it reads like the problem was Facebook communicating within itself, not to the outside world (though that can obviously cause a worldwide outage, given &lt;a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2016/04/14/facebook-now-owns-domain-name-registrar/"&gt;how much of its own network stack&lt;/a&gt; Facebook controls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wo7RY5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHfYUbKNEyc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xoON2I"&gt;What does DNS have to do with all this?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="FGuWsc"&gt;To borrow &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/"&gt;an explanation from Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;: DNS tells you where you’re going, and BGP tells you how to get there. DNS is how computers know what IP address a website or other resource can be found at, but that knowledge itself isn’t helpful — if you ask your friend where their house is, you’re still probably going to need GPS to get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1Pfe6"&gt;Cloudflare also has a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;great technical rundown&lt;/a&gt; of how BGP errors can also mess up DNS requests — the article is specifically about Monday’s Facebook incident, so it’s worth a read if you’re looking for an explanation of what it looked like from an autonomous system’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="SX5gSi"&gt;What can go wrong with BGP?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ulglag"&gt;Many things. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;According to Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, two notable incidents include a Turkish ISP accidentally telling the entire internet to route its traffic to its service in 2004 and a Pakistani ISP accidentally banning YouTube worldwide after trying to do so only for its users. Because of BGP’s ability to spread from autonomous system to autonomous system (which, as a reminder, is one of the things that makes it so darn useful), one group making a mistake can cascade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="opwgjA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is sometimes called the duct tape of the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAmSlc"&gt;One group getting owned can also cause problems — in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275982/myetherwallet-hack-bgp-dns-hijacking-stolen-ethereum"&gt;hackers were able to hijack requests to Amazon’s DNS&lt;/a&gt; and steal thousands of dollars in Ethereum by compromising a separate ISP’s BGP servers. Amazon wasn’t the one hacked, but traffic meant for it ended up somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUS9AS"&gt;Or, you can mess it up and delete your entire service off the internet with a bad BGP update. BGP is lovingly called the duct tape of the internet, but no adhesive is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nLdTL"&gt;So what happened to Facebook?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FZM7pm"&gt;It seems like Facebook’s servers, for some reason, told everyone to take them off their maps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;Facebook has issued an initial report&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s light on details — it’s possible Facebook plans on releasing a more in-depth explanation later, saying why the changes were made, but this may also be the last we hear about it (at least officially). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNQyrK"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176"&gt;Cloudflare’s CTO&lt;/a&gt; reports that the service saw a ton of BGP updates from Facebook (most of which were route withdrawals, or erasing lines on the map leading to Facebook) right before it went dark. One of Fastly’s tech leads tweeted that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryan505/status/1445072241256013828"&gt;Facebook stopped providing routes to Fastly&lt;/a&gt; when it went offline, and &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/what-happened-to-facebook-instagram-whatsapp/"&gt;backs up the idea&lt;/a&gt; that it was some update to Facebook’s BGP that knocked out its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksYqld"&gt;I’d recommend &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;Cloudflare's explanation&lt;/a&gt; if you want nitty-gritty technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Qx49q6"&gt;If BGP was the problem, how does Facebook fix it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ReG75S"&gt;Given that the outage went on for hours, the answer seems to be “not easily.” Facebook needed to make sure that it was advertising the correct records and that those records were picked up by the internet at large. In other words, it needed to make sure its maps were right and that everyone could see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccYKNf"&gt;That’s easier said than done, though. There were reports of Facebook employees &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1445099150316503057"&gt;being locked out from badge-protected doors&lt;/a&gt; and of employees struggling to communicate. In situations like these, you not only have to figure out who has the knowledge to solve the problem, and who has the permissions to solve the problem, but how to connect those people. And when your entire company is dead in the water, that’s no easy task — &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;received reports&lt;/a&gt; of engineers being physically sent to a Facebook data center in California to try to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dEvABc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Locked out and totally down: Facebook is scrambling to fix massive outage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="ETZccb"&gt;Would Web3 solve this problem?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="TSKifo"&gt;Stop it. I will cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JHHM"&gt;But to quickly answer the question, probably not — even if Facebook hopped on the decentralized train, there’d still have to be some protocol telling you where to find its resources. We’ve seen that it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/"&gt;misconfigure or mess up blockchain contracts&lt;/a&gt; before, so I’d be a bit suspicious of anyone who said that a contract and blockchain-based internet would be immune to this kind of issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7sIC21"&gt;Sure was fishy timing on that outage given all the bad Facebook news, huh?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="CjEq4n"&gt;Right, so obviously, the fact that this all happened while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;a whistleblower was going on TV and airing out Facebook’s dirty laundry&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy to come up with alternative explanations. But it’s just as possible that this is an innocent mistake that some (very, very unfortunate) person on Facebook’s IT staff made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uimo91"&gt;For what it’s worth, that’s Facebook’s explanation. It lays the blame on a “faulty configuration change” that it made, not any devious hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wxu2O4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:44PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with information from Facebook’s official engineering post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is back online after a massive outage that also took down Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG0Qx5icf91JlXCq-1SEPtG9q6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948694/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, its entire network of services suddenly went offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmd6V"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET and took nearly six hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709654/instagram-facebook-outage-whatsapp-oculus"&gt;before it was resolved&lt;/a&gt;. This is the worst outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, as the downtime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"&gt;hit hardest on the small businesses and creators who rely on these services&lt;/a&gt; for their income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dY4v4"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;issued an explanation for the outage on Monday evening&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it was due to a configuration issue. The company says it doesn’t believe any user data was impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC6Rko"&gt;After failing all tests for most of the day, a test of ISP DNS servers via &lt;a href="http://DNSchecker.org"&gt;DNSchecker.org&lt;/a&gt; showed most of them successfully finding a route to &lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; at 5:30PM ET. A few minutes later, we were able to start using Facebook and Instagram normally; however, it may take time for the DNS fixes to reach everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="edlDtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook engineers were dispatched to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e7AlIx"&gt;On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” Mike Schroepfer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;who will step down from his post as CTO next year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdUNeh"&gt;Inside Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;the outage has broken nearly all of the internal systems employees use to communicate and work&lt;/a&gt;. Several employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;they resorted to talking through their work-provided Outlook email accounts, though employees can’t receive emails from external addresses. Employees who were logged into work tools such as Google Docs and Zoom before the outage can still use those, but any employee who needs to log in with their work email was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht1q2C"&gt;Facebook engineers have been sent to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem, according to two people familiar with the situation. That meant the outage, already Facebook’s most severe in years, could be further prolonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l3G5TB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook down right now? This global outage is tough on everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"},{"title":"Twitter is up, Facebook is down, and Jack Dorsey is laughing ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/4/22709235/twitter-jack-dorsey-dunk-facebook-outage-dns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="x5968t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*Sincere* apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook powered services right now.  We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems were widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms were unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXykPn"&gt;Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — were suddenly “withdrawn from the internet.” While some have speculated about hackers, or an internal protest over last night’s whistleblower report, there isn’t any information yet to suggest anything malicious is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jijz8O"&gt;&lt;a href="http://Instagram.com"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; was flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely told us that something went wrong. The problem also affected its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users could load games they already have installed, and the browser works, but social features or installing new games didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhSAXC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 3:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional information about the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXsyU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, along with internal Facebook updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ06Jm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted outage is still ongoing, added information about the 2019 outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNGZJ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNS updates suggest Facebook is closing in on a solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av16YP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 6:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMoEdQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Facebook’s explanation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
