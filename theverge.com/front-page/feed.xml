    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a4eq7M"&gt;The new ball-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;, which was released last year, was frequently discounted over the holiday season. If you missed those deals and are looking to grab two Echo Dots, Amazon is currently running a promotion that allows you to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084J4MZK8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a703bc6b8141b27e290f322ffa1dd1f6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two for $50&lt;/a&gt; (before tax) when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;DOT2PACK&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GoR9Eq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pS6v38"&gt;If you are looking to pick up Apple’s flagship earbuds, there are a few deals currently available. Right now, if you want the lowest price for these wireless earbuds and don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729136281790037757" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="Wv5evx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8q4HQ4"&gt;At Best Buy, you can buy a pair of Beats Solo Pro headphones &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729136008423635134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in light blue for $170&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729136078803064284" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729135573227190787" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy blue for just $180&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $300, the Beats Solo Pro are great if you are looking for a pair of wireless headphones because of their effective noise cancellation and increased sweat resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HcONUw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625639"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2qcJqt"&gt;Preorders for the OnePlus Nord N100 phone began last Friday. If you pre-purchase the phone through &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1611766-REG%2Foneplus_5011101344_oneplus_nord_n100_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo, you will also receive a $30 gift card&lt;/a&gt; for the retailer at no additional cost. Or if you want to preorder through the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-n100&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus’ website&lt;/a&gt;, the company will throw in a pair of black OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z earbuds for free. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Play a crowdsourced Pokémon Red through this Twitter account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YcHuBaZ_3JHnSL-1szpbw5Rwn8=/12x82:1287x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650445/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_11.41.19_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ij0igN"&gt;In 2014, a Twitch user turned a game of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Red&lt;/em&gt; into a co-op experience with thousands of players. TwitchPlaysPokémon used crowdsourced commands to move through the game’s world, culminating in the defeat of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/1/5459702/thousands-of-twitch-tv-viewers-beat-massively-multiplayer-pokemon-game"&gt;Elite Four&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8281669/twitch-plays-pokemon-finally-captures-all-151-monsters"&gt;capture of all 151&lt;/a&gt; of the original series pokémon. Gameloft 3D programmer Constantin Liétard is attempting a similar feat, this time through Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16hhng"&gt;Liétard’s version plays out through his avatar — the image updates with the game’s progress as players battle and travel through &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Red&lt;/em&gt;’s world. To play, users tweet commands — up, down, start, select, and so on — on an ongoing thread. Comments are pulled every 15 seconds, Liétard tweeted, with the most commented directive then being entered into the game. Users can discuss strategy on a &lt;a href="https://t.co/08exqJA5nx?amp=1"&gt;Discord channel&lt;/a&gt; Liétard created specifically for the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aOy8AO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can now play Pokemon Red in my avatar!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comment one of those buttons on this tweet:&lt;br&gt;Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, Start, Select &lt;a href="https://t.co/9RV383BGjW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9RV383BGjW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Constantin Liétard (@screenshakes) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/screenshakes/status/1347589296593788933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QfzeE4"&gt;The game kicked off on January 8th. Based on how long it took Twitch to finish &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Red&lt;/em&gt;, it’s probably going to take a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch ended 2020 with its biggest numbers ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Distributes Food In Areas Hard-Hit By COVID-19" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YGPAXfT0qazrGgSt4m-NKqYaWDk=/1x0:7582x5054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650431/1282573925.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RGbOo"&gt;Twitch had a good 2020. Events were virtual; people stayed inside. The live-streaming site managed to clock 17 &lt;em&gt;billion &lt;/em&gt;hours watched last year, which is a full 83 percent higher than 2019’s 9 billion, according to the latest report from StreamElements and Arsenal.gg. The jump wasn’t limited to Twitch; Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming also posted their best numbers ever last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zstjE"&gt;“Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook all experienced major jumps in viewership traffic, which includes Twitch hitting 3 back-to-back milestones from October to December to end with a record high of 1.7B hours watched in that final month,” writes Doron Nir, CEO of StreamElements. For YouTube, that meant 10 billion watch hours in 2020; Facebook Gaming hit 3.59 billion, a jump of 166 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEaMre"&gt;The pandemic gave live-streaming its best year ever. Streamers became household names and made waves in the press. The barriers between gaming and the rest of the internet seemed to break open, especially with the runaway success of games like &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; and, crucially, &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;(though neither game broke into Twitch’s top 10 most-watched list by the end of the year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGh24A"&gt;Probably the most important streaming moment last year happened when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525740/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-aoc-twitch-hasanabi-pokimane-ilhan-omar-among-us"&gt;joined some of the stars in Twitch’s firmament to play some cheeky games of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her stream broke site-wide records: Ocasio-Cortez peaked at 435,000 viewers, which is good enough for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/21/aocs-twitch-stream-was-one-of-the-platforms-biggest-ever-.html#:~:text=Blevins%20still%20holds%20the%20record,battle%20with%20the%20rapper%20Drake."&gt;fifth largest individual stream of all time on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll be exciting to see what happens to streaming in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoCbJA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxsCGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nio unveils electric sedan after brush with collapse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtRGtxBhIOA-RwsGFg8xBHQl8UA=/0x61:2022x1409/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650407/NIO_ET7.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="79Tjiq"&gt;Chinese EV startup Nio unveiled an electric sedan called the ET7 this weekend that it promises will have autonomous capabilities and, eventually, a solid-state battery option. It’s a big project that Nio is only able to tackle after pulling off an incredible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363307/nio-sales-record-q2-revenue-finances-es8-es6-china"&gt;rebound from the brink&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYmCb2"&gt;Nio will sell a version of the sedan, which is based on a previous concept &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18389666/electric-sedans-nio-xpeng-geely-shanghai-auto-show"&gt;first shown at the 2019 Shanghai Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;, that can go 500 kilometers (about 310 miles) on a full battery for 448,000 yuan (about $69,000) and one that can supposedly eclipse 700 kilometers (about 435 miles) for 506,000 yuan (about $78,000). The first vehicles are slated to be delivered in China in early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2gU0A"&gt;Nio, which is backed by Tencent, will sell a “premier edition” of the ET7 with the larger battery pack as well for 526,000 yuan (roughly $81,000). For those who find those price tags a bit rich, Nio will sell each variant as part of what the company refers to as its “battery as a service” program, where owners pay a per-month fee over a base cost of 378,000 yuan (about $58,000). The higher the range they choose, the higher the monthly fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZioUfm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The once-delayed sedan marks an incredible rebound for Nio&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zR4zBU"&gt;Inside the ET7, a 12.8-inch OLED display pops out from the center of the dashboard, powered by the newest automotive-rated version of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor. A digital instrument cluster sits behind the steering wheel, and Nio’s little ball-shaped AI robot, Nomi, is perched on top of the dashboard. The ET7 is powered by a 180kW electric motor up front and a 300 kW motor in the rear, which combine to make more than 600 horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77kXCH"&gt;Nio is also developing a solid-state battery pack that it says can push the range over 1,000 kilometers, or about 621 miles. (It should be noted that Nio is using the far more optimistic NEDC standard, meaning real-world range might not live up to these claims.) That pack will become available in late 2022, Nio says, and will be compatible with the company’s three existing SUVs as well, should customers want to swap in a much longer-range option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JJvjJ7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10277688"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHZbhu"&gt;Nio spent a good portion of its annual “Nio Day” event this past weekend showing off the ET7, which is studded with smarts that power what the company is calling “point-to-point autonomous driving” — a big step up from the Tesla Autopilot-style driver assistance package Nio currently includes on its SUVs. The ET7 has 33 sensors integrated into the body, including 12 ultrasonic sensors, 11 8-megapixel cameras, five millimeter-wave radars, two positioning units, and an “ultra long-range high-resolution LIDAR” on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6SiOT"&gt;That Nio finally felt ready to show off the ET7 (and, frankly, that Nio Day was even held) is evidence of the startup’s remarkable recovery from the brink. Nio started delivering its first vehicle, the ES8 SUV, in mid-2018 before becoming a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. But it spent 2019 dealing with crisis after crisis. It got hit with a one-two economic punch when China reduced subsidies on expensive electric vehicles ahead of a pre-pandemic economic slowdown. Then the company had to recall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20801863/nio-battery-fire-recall-es8-china-electric-cars-sales"&gt;thousands of ES8s due to a fire risk in the battery packs&lt;/a&gt;. It canceled plans for its own factory, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/18527131/nio-ev-startup-formula-e-racing-team-sale"&gt;sold its Formula E electric racing team&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18642571/nio-delay-et7-sedan-first-quarter-new-vehicle"&gt;delayed the sedan project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5IZ0U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nio started 2020 in a bad place — even before the pandemic took hold&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="533i8t"&gt;Add in five years of unchecked growth (by Nio’s own admission), and Nio finished 2019 in a bad place. Despite starting production on a second, more affordable SUV (the ES6), Nio was still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155949/nio-hefei-investment-ec6-bailout-coronavirus-china"&gt;losing money faster than it was bringing it in&lt;/a&gt;, and it had less than $300 million in the bank to start the final quarter of the year — and this was all &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDpBWU"&gt;Nio began 2020 by warning its investors that it didn’t have enough cash to make it through the year. Then, in February, it inked a bailout deal with a group of state-owned or state-adjacent entities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155949/nio-hefei-investment-ec6-bailout-coronavirus-china"&gt;worth more than $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange, Nio agreed to open up a second headquarters in a new province. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;also gave the investor group a sizable chunk of a new subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; that Nio transferred its “core business and assets” to — plus the group “voting rights with respect to various significant corporate matters” like changes to the subsidiary’s corporate structure and its “core business and ... articles of association.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5GKkz"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-NS6To" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/NS6To/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="732" data-iframe-fallback-height="507" data-iframe-fallback-alt="" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NS6To/1/" data-iframe-width="732" data-iframe-height="507" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Nio's monthly deliveries through 2020" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-NS6To");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-NS6To");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="duV0Tj"&gt;In subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nio admitted that assigning such rights “may significantly limit [its] ability to make certain major corporate decisions with regard to” the new subsidiary, simply called Nio China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdXyAM"&gt;While it will take years to truly understand the long-term implications of that deal, it has saved Nio in the short term. Nio had a record 2020 despite the economic slowdown brought on by the pandemic in the first half of the year. It started rolling out a revamped version of the ES8 SUV that rejuvenated sales, and it released a third, even smaller SUV called the EC6 that is already selling better than the other two models. Nio finished the year having delivered 43,728 vehicles, including 17,353 in the fourth quarter of 2020 alone — half of what it delivered in all of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZU7Az"&gt;This resurrection was fortunately timed, too, as electric vehicle stocks soared in the second half of 2020, fueled by the astronomical rise of Tesla’s valuation and the boom of reverse-mergers that brought billions of dollars of new money into the space. Nio’s stock price now sits at nearly $60 per share after languishing in the single digits since its 2018 debut on the NYSE. The company took full advantage of this newfound interest, too, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2Fnio-just-raised-3-billion-heres-why%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22222151%2Fnio-et7-sedan-specs-range-autonomous-electric-china#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;raising $3 billion in a new offering near the end of the year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrEEKU"&gt;In many ways, the new sedan is an emblem of those accomplishments. It’s laden with the best technology that Nio has developed or sourced during its short history. It’s a project that was pulled back off the shelf only because the startup can once again burn through resources without causing an existential crisis. It’s a nod to the company’s future, too, with Nio promising that a solid-state battery option is on the way. And it helps round out Nio’s lineup in an increasingly competitive market, one that’s not only full of well-funded startups, but now features major tech conglomerates like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218903/china-baidu-geely-electric-cars-partnership-tech"&gt;Alibaba and Baidu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nickelodeon aired an NFL game and proved technology can make football way more fun</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s0aReAwZmXVN6ANUlVSx5h_9anc=/127x0:1276x766/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650399/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_11.08.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Nickelodeon half-time report, presented in block form.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y7BWf2"&gt;If people tuned into the Chicago Bears vs. New Orleans Saints game on CBS, they may have missed all the slime. In a play for a broadcast aimed at a younger audience, the NFL aired the Wild Card matchup &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2021/1/10/22223924/nickelodeon-f-bomb-cordarelle-patterson-bears-saints-nfl"&gt;simultaneously on Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt;, with its own announcers, goofy on-screen animations, and touchdown celebrations featuring &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt; characters and, of course, green slime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WnowS"&gt;From the minute the game kicked off at 4:40PM ET to the second it ended, Nickelodeon’s broadcast was chaotic absurdity and a total delight. Whenever a player scored a touchdown, slime cannons would erupt in the end zone. Digital art, like clouds appearing at players’ feet or lighting across their chest, appeared often during replays. Nickelodeon stars — including 15-year-old Gabrielle Nevaeh Green — reported from the sidelines, making references to the network’s shows. Everyone involved seemingly embraced the utter silliness of it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laH73j"&gt;Part of the novelty was the spectacle of it all; Nickelodeon doesn’t air NFL games (this was a special effort organized by ViacomCBS, which owns Nickelodeon) and its characters are so well known that seeing Squidward and Patrick Star emerge from a dog pile works across a number of different audiences. Part of it, however, is also a testament to how technology can do more than just enhance the visual quality of games (yes, the 8K camera footage was unsettling) — it can make them way more fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q7zs7q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The slime after a TD!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NFL on Nickelodeon   &lt;a href="https://t.co/E82RqeH3AW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/E82RqeH3AW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Complex Sports (@ComplexSports) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ComplexSports/status/1348390006981873669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tpcKbV"&gt;Like something out of a fever dream, the broadcast walked a fine line between feeling like a video game simulation of an NFL Wild Card game and an actual NFL Wild Card game. It was more colorful than a standard NFL game, and having Young Sheldon appear to explain the rules quickly to viewers managed to stay cute instead of creating an abysmal, eye-rolling experience. As &lt;a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2021/01/11/nfl-playoff-game-nickelodeon-broadcast-not-too-serious"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt;’s Conor Orr wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “To have the game stripped of all its self-importance and hubris was an absolute delight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gw2Cza"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These Nickelodeon highlights   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pewpewpew?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#pewpewpew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/xmY8vp20WK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/xmY8vp20WK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NFL Retweet (@NFLRT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFLRT/status/1348398632874213377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mkK1qi"&gt;Despite the zany graphics and color overload not typically present in an NFL match, the broadcast succeeded because it never talked down to its audience. It didn’t feel dumber on Nickelodeon, or even more immature. The game felt vibrant, fun and — for people who spend their Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays hunkered down in front of a television set to catch whatever games are on — refreshingly new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5dypS"&gt;Technology doesn’t just have to provide the &lt;em&gt;clearest &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;sharpest &lt;/em&gt;viewing experience. It can also create the most innovative, inventive, and downright fun. A quick Twitter search reveals that I’m not the only person who enjoyed seeing the end zone splattered with slime when Drew Brees hit Michael Thomas for a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5eGpD"&gt;Here’s hoping that ViacomCBS figures out a way to do it again in the 2021-2022 season, or at the very least, continues experimenting. Also, just tossing it out into the universe, but considering that Disney owns ESPN and has experimented with simulcasting games on its ABC network, why not find a way to broadcast a game on Disney Channel? Elsa and Olaf can provide live commentary! Captain America and Iron Man can represent the two opposing teams and fight! Lightsabers can light up in the end zone when touchdowns happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ag1pU"&gt;NFL games don’t have to be serious all the time. Nickelodeon proved there’s an excited audience, of kids and adults, who would take a little SpongeBob throughout the four quarters. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netgear’s new Nighthawk RAXE500 is its first Wi-Fi 6E router</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hYRiunAzqlEHnrBnlxxJlL7H3dE=/0x0:861x574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650285/raxe500_dual.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6a3WRz"&gt;At CES 2021, Netgear announced its first Wi-Fi 6E-ready device that takes full advantage of the 6GHz band: the Nighthawk RAXE500, a $599.99 tri-band wireless router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjAJ9V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt; wireless routers like this one broadcast over the 6GHz band, in addition to serving the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands that most devices can use. A number of devices launching at CES 2021 will support Wi-Fi 6E, and as a result, routers like the new Nighthawk RAXE500 can provide unfettered bandwidth to devices that require a lot of it. Not just that, devices connected via 6GHz can avoid disruptions from the many other household devices (even those being used by nearby neighbors) that operate on the crowded 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Lygl9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Wi-Fi’s biggest upgrade in decades is starting to arrive ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22212938/wifi-6e-rollout-starting-2021-smartphones-tvs-laptops-vr-routers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OfoSry"&gt;Netgear’s new high-end router looks like a manta ray, which is to say it’s relatively par for the course for the Nighthawk line of wireless routers. Looks aren’t everything, though — the router should provide some very fast AXE11000 Wi-Fi signals. Netgear claims that this device can push beyond gigabit speeds for mobile devices, and that it has a total throughput of 10.8Gbps over wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1N0qb"&gt;The new Nighthawk features five gigabit ports and two USB 3.0 ports on its rear. It supports multi-gigabit speeds via a compatible DOCSIS 3.1 modem, either through the RAXE500’s single 2.5Gb link or by opting for a multiport link aggregation method (which offers up to 2Gbps speeds).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Netgear Nighthawk RAXE500" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijjNy4cZBR2fM7B3_2JNq15uoVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214960/raxe500.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of the ports featured on the RAXE500 Wi-Fi 6E router.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uzL42q"&gt;Netgear has some other announcements for CES 2021, including an unlocked version of its Nighthawk M5 5G mobile Wi-Fi 6 hotspot. A variant that’s locked to AT&amp;amp;T already exists, but this one’s unlocked for use with a SIM from any carrier that supports sub-6GHz 5G spectrums. (For this and the products mentioned below, Netgear says it has certification for T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T, though it’s still working to get Verizon’s certification and hopes to by February.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Netgear Nighthawk M5 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOnUXX44_9L1B0yxynGC-OzLnMw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214953/nighthawkm5.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w1qgyw"&gt;The mobile hotspot’s internal battery can last up to 13 hours, if it lives up to Netgear’s claims, or it can operate plugged in via its USB-C port. In addition to serving as a wireless router that can connect to up to 32 wireless devices at once, the hotspot can be used as a 5G modem by plugging it into a wireless router via its Ethernet port. This could be handy if you live in a place that doesn’t have great options for internet service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBmwKk"&gt;The Nighthawk M5 5G mobile Wi-Fi 6 hotspot is coming to North America in the first half of 2021, and while no price has been announced for the US region, it currently costs a hefty €799 in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Netgear LM1200 and LAX20 routers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b51XtGF1yPBjFawcsMEC2lzY31M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214955/netgearannouncements2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right: the Netgear LM1200 modem and the Nighthawk LAX20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pguKtH"&gt;In a similar vein, Netgear has two other new products that are unlocked and support a mobile network via SIM cards, which could be useful to fall back on if there’s an internet service interruption or in place of having internet wired into your living space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iihsIV"&gt;The LM1200 is a $149.99 modem that accepts a 4G LTE SIM and supports CAT4 speeds (up to 150Mbps). It’ll be available later this month. If you want a Wi-Fi 6 wireless router that accepts a 4G LTE SIM card, the $299.99 Nighthawk LAX20, which is now available, may be a good fit. In addition to supporting wireless connections, it’s faster for wired connections than the LM1200 with CAT6 speeds (up to 300Mbps). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z33u2x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler posts, some with GPS data, have been archived by an independent researcher</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Parler logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3V1swz0a_6H8ZwD8k3idrc6GkM4=/73x0:3483x2273/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650249/1230527804.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mSGz13"&gt;Before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Parler went offline&lt;/a&gt; early Monday, a researcher says she archived 99 percent of its posts, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/every-deleted-parler-post-many-with-users-location-dat-1846032466?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The researcher, identified only by her Twitter handle, @donk_enby, started archiving Parler posts after the January 6th attack on the Capitol in Washington, DC that left six people dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8EfeA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/fast-thinking-how-the-capitol-riot-was-coordinated-online/"&gt;Parler has been identified&lt;/a&gt; as one of the sites where people who participated in the riot planned and coordinated the attack on the Capitol. @donk_enby says she began cataloging Parler posts on January 6th in an attempt to create a public record. That effort had to be accelerated when Amazon announced on Saturday it was pulling web hosting services from the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;for violating its terms of service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWKCBF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;Posts on Parler encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt;, leading to last Wednesday’s attack on the Capitol, and even in the days afterward, there were posts warning that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/right-wing-extremists-vow-return-washington-joe-biden-s-inauguration-n1253546"&gt;Trump supporters would return to Washington&lt;/a&gt; on January 19th for more violence. “We will come in numbers that no standing army or police agency can match,” one user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4H8Tg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348213666257252353?s=20"&gt;@donk_enby said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the effort to archive Parler posts was akin to “a bunch of people running into a burning building trying to grab as many things as we can.” She added that “things will be available in a more accessible form later.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRPSqB"&gt;Parler suffered a data breach — the extent of which is still not clear — back in November, which it blamed on a third-party vendor. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/parler-data-breach-twitter-social-network-conservative-hack-2020-11"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported at the time&lt;/a&gt; that a misconfigured Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud server was to blame for inadvertently exposing Parler users’ data. Parler said no personal user data was exposed. But the breach put a spotlight on some concerning privacy practices at the company; for instance, in order to get a “verified” Parler account, &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/parler-wasnt-hacked-but-that-doesnt-mean-its-safe-to-u-1845757409"&gt;users had to provide their Social Security numbers&lt;/a&gt; and upload a photo ID image. The company said it deleted the information once users had been vetted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsZA5c"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tracker.archiveteam.org/parler/"&gt;The newly scraped data&lt;/a&gt;, however, shows videos uploaded to Parler with GPS data, some of which had been deleted and some of which were private. It also has information about site admins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jkQNE9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I am now crawling URLs of all videos uploaded to Parler. Sequentially from latest to oldest. VIDXXX.txt files coming up, 50k chunks, there will be 1.1M URLs total: &lt;a href="https://t.co/YUl8CtoeEA"&gt;https://t.co/YUl8CtoeEA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This may include things from deleted/private posts.&lt;/p&gt;— crash override (@donk_enby) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1348281459031814146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oij1R5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222637/amazon-workers-aws-stop-hosting-services-parler-capitol-violence"&gt;Amazon told Parler it was terminating&lt;/a&gt; web hosting services late Saturday. Its AWS “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws"&gt;the letter to the company states&lt;/a&gt;, adding that Parler “poses a very real risk to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDRCJb"&gt;The move followed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;bans from Google&lt;/a&gt; and Apple, both of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;kicked Parler out of their app stores&lt;/a&gt;, effectively decimating its mobile app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgLpkL"&gt;Parler launched in 2018, presenting itself as a free speech alternative to other social media sites. As Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;tightened their moderation policies&lt;/a&gt;, especially around election and coronavirus information, Parler’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;user numbers soared&lt;/a&gt;, with its less-strict moderation policies appealing to many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytelNk"&gt;Parler CEO John Matze wrote in a post on Parler late Saturday that he believes Amazon, Google, and Apple “worked together to try and ensure they don’t have competition,” adding “They will NOT win! We are the worlds last hope for free speech and free information.” He had pledged to rebuild the site from scratch and said it would be back online within a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1cvrw"&gt;But on Sunday, Matze posted that “most people with enough servers to host us have shut their doors to us,” telling Fox News &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;even its lawyers had abandoned the company&lt;/a&gt;. “Every vendor, from text message services to email providers to our lawyers, all ditched us too, on the same day,” &lt;a href="https://video.foxnews.com/v/6221679825001#sp=show-clips"&gt;Matze said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZjE3X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByZt79"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s new 40-inch curved ultrawide monitor is packed with pixels and ports</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4sY1PyOtlP9Ogk8U2Qm84y7IW70=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650217/maxresdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1E3F0"&gt;Among the monitors Dell has announced at this year’s CES is the &lt;a href="https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2021~01~20210105-dell-technologies-reimagines-work-with-new-pcs-monitors-and-software-experiences.htm#newsroom-city-date:~:text=With%20more%20people%20in%20front%20of,%E2%80%93%20and%20the%20new%20Latitude%20portfolio."&gt;Dell UltraSharp 40 Curved WUHD U4021QW&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s claiming is the “world’s first 40-inch ultrawide curved WUHD (5K2K) monitor.” 5K2K, in case you were wondering, translates to a pixel resolution of 5120 x 2160. That gives it the same vertical pixel count as a typical 4K screen, but with an ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio. By the standards of most monitors, it’s a lot of pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxqSSh"&gt;The UltraSharp 40 Curved WUHD has a full array of ports, including a Thunderbolt 3 port that can supply a compatible MacBook with up to 90W of power. Other ports include a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4 port, four USB Type-A ports with data speeds of up to 10Gbps, an Ethernet port, 3.5mm jack, and a USB Type-B upstream port, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/10/dell-ultrasharp-40-display-u4021qw/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBsZLY"&gt;Its refresh rate is just 60Hz, which is a little on the low side compared to gaming monitors, meaning it’s probably better suited to productivity tasks (not that many graphics cards would be able to run games at this resolution at more than 60fps).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9nqPtBohdam4G8XWL7IJtAJYRic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227593/msedge_oLADYPcEdR.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a big collection of ports on its back, plus a couple more on its underside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NbjQR3"&gt;Dell isn’t the first company to announce a monitor with this resolution; LG introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/21/16804850/lg-hdr-5k-ultrawide-monitor-ces-specs"&gt;a 34-inch monitor&lt;/a&gt; with it in 2017. But Dell’s new monitor is bigger and curved, which is how it gets to boast of its “world’s first” status. The UltraSharp 40 Curved WUHD Monitor goes on sale on January 28th, with prices starting at $2,099.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why platforms had to cut off Trump and Parler</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US capitol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eu6SSrjxuSTw2ffwBS39UN7_7HA=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650140/us_capitol_5.1419979475.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OT7f9m"&gt;Last week saw unprecedented mob violence in our nation’s capital and a huge shift in the internet’s relationship with President Donald Trump. Major sites like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which excused harassment and outright threats from the president for years, banned him in a matter of days. The social network Parler, a home for Trump supporters too extreme for those big networks, was banned from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;’s App Stores and then by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon’s hosting services&lt;/a&gt;. As of this morning, the network cannot be accessed in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOnNsa"&gt;Skeptics have called the deplatforming &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348246215687692291?s=21"&gt;a “censorship orgy”&lt;/a&gt; or a move to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1348293737475141634?s=21"&gt;“one-party control of information distribution.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattWalshBlog/status/1347783212769169409"&gt;One pundit&lt;/a&gt; argued that “big tech has the power to utterly erase you from modern existence” — a strange claim after an attack that resulted in several deaths. Faced with a mass raid on the Capitol, many have instead launched an alternate conversation about the role of platforms in moderating speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="WH0vo3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Platforms have always reserved the right to take down speech that poses an immediate risk of violence&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaYyW3"&gt;There are real reasons to be worried about the power of speech platforms like Facebook and particularly infrastructure providers like Amazon. But it’s not true that last week’s actions were unprecedented, and it doesn’t make sense to characterize them as some kind of Stalinist purge. Instead, they are simply a desperate response to a desperate situation — the best option in the face of widespread failures of American government. This kind of mass deplatforming is a last resort. But after one of the most violent and alarming weeks in recent history, it’s a justified one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asazaE"&gt;First, we should acknowledge the scale of the destruction that platforms are responding to. Six people are dead, and there is real and sustained concern that there will be further violence between now and Inauguration Day. Many of the perpetrators have been apprehended, but nowhere near the entire 8,000 who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sund-riot-national-guard/2021/01/10/fc2ce7d4-5384-11eb-a817-e5e7f8a406d6_story.html"&gt;reportedly participated in the assault&lt;/a&gt;. Trump has scheduled another rally at Alamo, Texas, later this week, and the conditions that produced the Capitol raid are still very much in effect. There is no reason all of this could not happen again in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnBCid"&gt;If you want to argue that platforms are overreacting, then it matters what they’re reacting to. The moderation actions of the past week came in response to an immediate deadly attack on the seat of government and an ongoing threat of seditious violence. You can argue that the moderation was poorly targeted or insufficiently, but it was entirely proportional to the scale of the threat. Facebook and Twitter’s response is no more extreme than &lt;a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-issues-mayor%E2%80%99s-order-extending-today%E2%80%99s-public-emergency-15-days-a1"&gt;declaring a 15-day state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; or mobilizing the National Guard. This is an emergency situation, and it calls for decisive action — from platforms every bit as much as law enforcement. This, for better or worse, is what decisive platform action looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZrhCAj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What changed last week weren’t the principles of moderation, but the facts on the ground&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uACrMr"&gt;The other concern is that the recent actions will set a bad precedent — but the principles here have been in place for some time. &lt;a href="https://jilliancyork.com/2021/01/10/everything-pundits-are-getting-wrong-about-this-moment-in-platform-regulation-an-ongoing-list/"&gt;As Jillian York points out&lt;/a&gt;, platforms have always reserved the right to take down speech that poses an immediate risk of violence, and applied the same standards to political figures in foreign countries. You may disagree that Parler was being used to organize sedition, but Amazon’s action is entirely in line with previous moves against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban"&gt;8chan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16157710/cloudflare-daily-stormer-drop-russia-hate-white-nationalism"&gt;The Daily Stormer&lt;/a&gt;. Platforms haven’t always been clear about spelling this out, but it’s the basic principle at work in both the Trump and Parler deplatformings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qE3CvF"&gt;What changed last week weren’t the principles of moderation, but the facts on the ground. On January 5th, platforms could dismiss vague threats against Vice President Mike Pence or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as just overheated rhetoric; today, they have to grapple with a real risk of physical violence and sedition. That’s a horrifying shift, and it’s been difficult for players in every corner of US politics to come to grips with it. But tech companies are responding to that change, not causing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4K2QcC"&gt;That’s not to say the bans have been perfectly implemented. There’s been little to no transparency on which Twitter accounts were taken down and why, and such an accounting might reveal significant missteps by the company. (Among other gripes, there’s no real justification for taking down &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NathanJRobinson/status/1348025319417122818"&gt;the Red Scare podcast&lt;/a&gt; and not &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir"&gt;Ayatollah Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;.) But these mistakes are minor compared to the severity of the situation. The response shouldn’t be inaction, but the kind of comprehensive notice-and-appeal systems that &lt;a href="https://santaclaraprinciples.org/"&gt;speech advocates have been pushing for years&lt;/a&gt;. We need to make platform moderation systems better, not toss them out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="hja4QO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook and Amazon never set out to be the least-craven institutions in US political discourse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MII3dp"&gt;The actions against Parler have been even thornier. There’s been no meaningful accounting of the threatening content that led Parler to be deplatformed, and users of the site are right to demand a clearer explanation. More troubling, it took place at an infrastructure level, where major companies like Amazon and Google maintain a de facto monopoly — a power that’s much more troubling than Twitter’s power over its own network. Major platforms have always hosted ugly stuff, but they’ve maintained a public commitment to moderating potentially harmful speech — a commitment that Parler has conspicuously avoided. The result was a consistent and public refusal to moderate Stop The Steal activists, which forced Amazon to confront the same ugly choice as Facebook and Twitter before it. Ultimately, the company made the same decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxfCgS"&gt;At the bottom of it all is the sense that tech companies are leading our response to last week’s horror when it would be better led by elected officials, law enforcement, or even (God help us) the media. Tech companies would certainly agree with this. Facebook and Amazon never set out to be the least-craven institutions in US political discourse, and the moment someone else arrives to take that mantle, they will be thrilled to hand it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQ4feZ"&gt;Unfortunately, we are living through an era of institutional failure. There were many, many chances to avoid what happened last week and many, many failures. We should all hope for a future in which this kind of mass-deplatforming is not necessary and work toward it. In the meantime, we have to deal with the world and the country as it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s best true wireless earbuds yet are now available in more colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IDNqv3MbnGh62pBQdixU85llcXE=/1215x705:7265x4738/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68650024/Elite_85t_Color_Range_Lineup_LB_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four new colors will join the earbuds’ existing titanium and black model.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jabra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LORRGy"&gt;Jabra’s Elite 85T true wireless earbuds, which we called its “best earbuds yet” when we reviewed them last year, are getting four new color variants. Alongside the preexisting titanium / black color scheme, the earbuds will soon be available in gold / beige, copper / black, black, and gray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsPNSn"&gt;Outside of the new colors, the new Jabra Elite 85T earbuds are functionally identical to what we reviewed last year. That means they should offer a comfortable fit paired with good noise cancellation and excellent controls. They’re also able to connect to two sources at once, which is handy if you get a phone call while you’re listening to music on a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdZEwb"&gt;That’s not to say we didn’t have our reservations about the earbuds, which you can read about in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;our full review&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, the new colors will be available starting today from Jabra’s website for $229 (£219.99 / €229).&lt;/p&gt;
