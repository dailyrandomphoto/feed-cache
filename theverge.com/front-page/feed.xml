    <title>In Epic v Apple, everybody is losing at the game of defining games</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Is Roblox a game or not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gtxVrE"&gt;If you have ever wanted to see a bunch of mumbly nerds struggle to define what constitutes a “game,” well, is &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; the trial for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pAOnA"&gt;What is the difference between an “app” and a “game?” This sounds like a stoner question but instead occupied a fair amount of the morning in Epic v. Apple. Roblox, explained Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, was an app. See, games have a beginning, an end, and challenges. “There’s experiences within Roblox that we did not look at as a game,” Kosmynka said. We did establish that Minecraft is a game, though, so that’s nice for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This screenshot of the App Store clearly shows that Roblox is classified as a “game” — despite what Kosmynka testified." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLdCxWBQjWfGbbE5HTUm8p4fD6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499994/Screen_Shot_2021_05_07_at_5.30.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of Roblox on the Apple App Store, as of May 7 at 8PM ET&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7a5dp9"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers did not understand this distinction and neither did I. But here’s the problem for Apple: if Roblox &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game, then it’s fairly easy for Epic to compare Fortnite to it. Also, looking up Roblox in the App Store after Kosmynka testified, it is categorized as a “game.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYDWHr"&gt;Roblox is free, with in-app purchases. Since apparently no one can define what a game is, I can’t tell whether it’s fair to say that Roblox is a platform with games on it, but it sure looks that way when I log on. Scrolling through, there are a number of small squares where I can join a game, and each appears to have different rules. (The app calls these “worlds.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar2T1j"&gt;And when Kosmynka doesn’t get the category on Roblox right, well. That’s an own goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6ZQypK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1rqQ"&gt;Anyway, Kosmynka noticeably shrank when Epic’s Lauren Moskowitz began asking questions on the redirect. Were Snapchat’s bunny ear filters games? What about TikTok challenges? (The manner in which this question was asked convinced me that I was possibly the only person in the room on TikTok.) Things got worse for Kosmynka during a speed-run of questions. Had he used Fortnite? Yes. Had he attended a concert there? No. “Fortnite is a virtual world where you build a character, correct?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UImbUr"&gt;“I wouldn’t refer to Fortnite as a world. I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game,” Kosmynka replied. Had he done Battle Royale? Yes. Party Royale? No. Creative mode? No. He knew that Fortnite held concerts but didn’t know it streamed movies. In the context of “What is a game,” it made Kosmynka sound like he didn’t know what he was talking about. It was a tense, and rather devastating, line of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAE7pG"&gt;At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she didn’t understand why Minecraft was a game and Roblox was not. (Again, per the App Store: Roblox is &lt;em&gt;absolutely &lt;/em&gt;a game.) She asked Kosmynka for an industry definition for a game. Turns out, there isn’t one — although, my colleague Adi Robertson notes, game developers and academics will happily talk you under the table about magic circles, meaningful choices, and the works of Johan Huizinga if you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nresF0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ep3QIM"&gt;Later, Matthew Weissinger, VP of marketing at Epic Games, explained that Fortnite is a metaverse. “It’s one of the remarkable things about Fortnite, we’re building this thing called the metaverse, a social place,” he murmured softly. (All of the men we heard from today would benefit greatly from elocution lessons.) “One of the ways I’ve tried to explain it is, think about all of us in lockdown, and how we try to stay socially connected. Some of the most meaningful experiences I’ve had were logging into Zoom and we had our friends and parents and we celebrate grandpa’s birthday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLXukC"&gt;We also discover that Roblox has a “battle royale” mode, just like Fortnite. Honestly the question to me now is not &lt;em&gt;Is Roblox a game&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;Is Roblox a metaverse.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvpt6q"&gt;Throughout this line of questioning, it seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent — and passing the buck. Kosmynka testified that developers get to pick what category they belong to, not Apple, making his Roblox digression even weirder. The Roblox thing made Apple look slipshod, and the further testimony about the App Store review didn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lRdIg"&gt;The process behind App Store review is unbelievably boring unless you are a developer who is trying to pass review. We went through it in &lt;em&gt;exhaustive&lt;/em&gt; detail. Apple gets 100,000 app store submissions per week, Kosmynka testified. But only 500 people actually do the “human review” — a lot of the rest of the work is automated. It’s impossible to judge how good an automated process is by listening to someone describe it in abstract in the courtroom. Kosmynka seemed confident when he was being questioned by Apple’s attorney, but when Epic got a crack at him, his voice got softer and softer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="v132mG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f5EWrL"&gt;We heard about apps Apple had mistakenly allowed on the store: ones that carried malicious ad fraud code, apps that copycatted Headspace, a “school shooting game,” a game of shooting cannons at protestors, several inappropriate apps (the funniest of which was “Ganja Farm: Weed Empire”) and more. In emails, Kosmynka said, “We are making critical errors.” In reference to the school-shooting game, Kosmynka said he was “dumbfounded at how this could be missed.” These specifics were more damning than the abstract walk-through of the app review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4jSsK"&gt;At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers wondered if anyone was doing better than Apple at app store moderation. Kosmynka punted on this answer. “One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation,” said Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “One of my concerns is that if you aren’t letting parties compete on these topics, things won’t improve.” She then asked if Apple hired third party reviewers. It does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1Ij7k"&gt;There is an implicit contrast here — the Epic Games Store. Steve Allison, VP and General Manager of the Epic Game Store, testified that there have been no known instances of malware or pirated content on the Epic Game Store, though there has been some fraud. It was hard not to notice the contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmwA1Y"&gt;Apple’s lawyer, who did not introduce herself, took us through an excruciating narration of the Epic Games website as part of her intensely chaotic cross-examination of Allison. I understand that a lot of things need to be narrated for the court record, but this was silly. We determined that there were a lot of games in the Epic Games Store. We also determined that there were 25 games in the “top 20” games section, which felt kind of bitchy. The first non-game app, Spotify, came to the store in December 2020. Fine, but this didn’t seem to make Epic look bad? Or at least, not the way she’d been hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QxHyvr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="413UDZ"&gt;She lingered on the store-within-a-store on Epic Game Store: Itch.io,a store for indie games that Epic added to its store in April. You can download itch.io’s store from Epic. “Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?” Apple’s lawyer asked. Some of the games on itch.io are “so offensive we cannot speak about them here,” she sniffed. This was a more successful line of argument — it essentially explained why Apple didn’t want stores within its own store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoXImk"&gt;Of course, the big contrast between the Apple App Store and the Epic Game Store was economic. The 30/70 split that Epic finds so objectionable began with retail — you used to have to buy games at Wal-Mart or GameStop or something, when they were physically packaged, Allison said quietly. As retailers moved away from PC games in favor of console games, Valve created Steam, which mimicked the 30/70 split from traditional retail — but it was viewed as an improvement among developers, since they didn’t have to pay for discs and packaging and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wPd2d"&gt;That is, until Minecraft self-published, in Allison’s telling. Then someone taking 30 percent looked steep. In 2018, Epic launched the Epic Games Store, which took only a 12 percent cut. (In order to assuage developers who might fear losing revenue from Steam when they took exclusive deals with Epic, Epic agreed to pay them a minimum guarantee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJ7DDu"&gt;Significantly, developers don’t have to use the Epic in-app payment system — they can use their own, meaning that Epic can theoretically get &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; money on in-app purchases. Wizards of the Coast, the publisher of Magic the Gathering Arena, and Ubisoft, with multiple titles, use their own payment systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8GFI1t"&gt;Still, I find myself returning to the question that began the day: What is a game? It’s shocking to me that so many people who specialize in apps and games can’t really answer this question. But I guess in some sense, you could imagine the trial is one — it’s got a beginning, a middle, and an end. Lots of money at stake. A winner and a loser. Plus, when the verdict is appealed — as it almost inevitably will be — we’ll get a sequel. Sure, Epic played well today, but you need more than one good turn to win.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia has figured out a way to ditch the fancy gamepad for TV play</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1EoUjfzMAjkBj7ch_OKQiN27A8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69255222/akrales_191113_3779_0309.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pj1JKE"&gt;Today, there’s only one official way to play Google’s Stadia game streaming service on your 4K TV — the last-gen Chromecast Ultra, connected to the company’s proprietary Stadia Controller over Wi-Fi. That’s because Google hasn’t yet brought Stadia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;to the new-and-improved $50 Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, and its predecessor didn’t support Bluetooth, meaning the only way to pair a controller was to loop through Google’s servers in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCsHaY"&gt;But Google now has a workaround,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/07/stadia-3-15-phone-tv-controller/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a new “bridge mode” hidden in the latest version of the Stadia app on Android that should let you send controller signals from your phone — letting you play Stadia with your phone’s touchscreen, or even connect another gamepad to your phone. You’ll be able to use your phone to change your TV’s volume, too, according to text snippets buried in the APK. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T9dVHTLpnFjk73dMgEweNxzQ75Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22499911/bridge.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google spotted this graphic in the APK to promote bridge mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VVwaDo"&gt;The original Stadia Controller has been something of a thorn in the company’s side ever since Stadia launched on November 19th, 2019, so it wouldn’t be surprising if Google decides to move on. It took many months for buyers to be able to use Google’s wireless controller wirelessly with anything &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the Chromecast Ultra — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248769/google-stadia-controller-wireless-computers-desktop-laptop"&gt;desktop web browsers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308374/google-stadia-controller-wireless-android-mobile-support"&gt;Android phones&lt;/a&gt; weren’t supported at first, meaning you had to physically plug in a USB-C cable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497850/google-stadia-controller-usb-c-support"&gt;USB-C audio took a while too&lt;/a&gt;, and Bluetooth audio via the controller still has yet to materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDLIXv"&gt;Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21215395/google-stadia-controller-how-to-pair-bluetooth-support-ps4-xbox-consoles"&gt;third-party controller support was quite robust&lt;/a&gt; on those other platforms, letting you easily sync a PlayStation or Xbox gamepad to play, and it’s unlikely you’ll even need this new Bridge Mode to play Stadia on the 2020 Chromecast whenever it arrives; the new Chromecast &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;support Bluetooth game controllers. Judging by a few Steam Link and GeForce Now sessions with my 8BitDo gamepad, Bluetooth gamepad support may work just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7ns3R6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use your own controllers to play Google Stadia","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21215395/google-stadia-controller-how-to-pair-bluetooth-support-ps4-xbox-consoles"},{"title":"Our unannounced Google Chromecast didn’t come with Stadia, but it sure does work","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494161/google-chromecast-stadia-cloud-gaming-streaming-support"},{"title":"The writing’s on the wall for Google Stadia","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5lpTY5"&gt;Right now, it’s just a little unclear how much Google cares about Stadia; after it axed all its in-house game studios in February, I argued that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;the writing was on the wall&lt;/a&gt;; since then, Stadia has &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/stadias-vp-and-head-of-product-leaves-google/"&gt;lost its head of product&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-05-05-six-additional-staff-leave-stadia-to-join-haven-studios"&gt;at least six additional staffers&lt;/a&gt;, and been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios"&gt;two reports about its internal struggles&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Google had to pay tens of millions of dollars to publishers like Ubisoft, per game, just to get games ported to Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s head apologizes for bug that deleted activists’ stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xl6UwwaCyRqIXfZfQwPNa0cU-i0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69254588/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YQFHcq"&gt;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764512521768960?s=20"&gt;has tweeted an apology&lt;/a&gt; about a bug that deleted users’ story posts on Thursday. The timing was unfortunate for activists trying to raise awareness about missing Indigenous women, with organizations Red Dress and National Day of Awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG, abbreviated by some as MMIWG2S to include two-spirit people) &lt;a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/mmiwg-movement-erased-online"&gt;questioning whether their posts&lt;/a&gt; had somehow been erased deliberately. According to Instagram, however, the bug affected stories, archives, and highlights of Instagram users across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD8DCx"&gt;Mosseri and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InstagramComms/status/1390376354332487681"&gt;Instagram’s statement&lt;/a&gt; about the deletions say this isn’t the case and that the stories were not removed because of anything content-related. He specifically addressed the Indigenous people’s concerns. “This day is incredibly important to raise awareness of this critical issue and support our Indigenous community on Instagram,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764511808737283?s=20"&gt;Mosseri tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “We apologize to all those who felt like they could not bring attention to these incredibly important causes, and many others around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QClRa0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many people thought we were removing their content because of what they posted or what hashtag they used, but this bug wasn’t related to the content itself, but rather a widespread issue that has now been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1390764510378532864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y1naSV"&gt;The issue of &lt;a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/known-and-not-forgotten"&gt;the high rates of violence against Indigenous people&lt;/a&gt; — especially women, girls, and two-spirit people — isn’t one that often gets a spotlight outside of reservations, so spreading awareness is especially important, activists say. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/instagram-stories-vanish-mmiwg-red-dress-day-1.6017113?cmp=rss"&gt;Speaking to CBC News&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of days like May 5th, community organizer Kakeka Thundersky said that “[e]veryone’s just stuck at home on their phone, unable to gather and able to go to the rallies, unable to talk to face to face with people,” making online platforms like Instagram a key tool for activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikA81A"&gt;Emily Henderson, an Inuk arts and culture writer, said that “[t]he digital space in general is really, really important right now just for maintaining community connections or connections.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What would a billionaire do on SNL?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="elon-musk-asa-mathat-02" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaTXxXu4Zhdg2miU5t_Cbl8f-xc=/0x0:2592x1728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69254543/REC_ASA_CODE2016-20160601-211928-4028.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asa Mathat/Recode&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzdmWR"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk — the first or second richest man in the world, depending on the phase of the Moon — will host &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401253/elon-musk-hosting-saturday-night-live-miley-cyrus-tesla-spacex"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this weekend (the first or second funniest show that airs on Saturday evenings, depending on if anything else is on TV). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZMe6U"&gt;The event is a strange confluence of things that &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;covers: a powerful tech leader with ambitions that are as huge as his blind spots, and someone destined to barrage you with so many dad jokes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388609/wolf-collar-camera-fish-voyageurs-minnesota"&gt;one is bound to land at some point&lt;/a&gt;. Plus maybe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387486/dogecoin-run-valuation-cryptocurrency-spike-elon-musk"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;? (A meme gone so awry that it’s shaping the actual landscape of the physical world is definitely some &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; shit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzSP6h"&gt;So what can we expect when Musk takes the stage late on Saturday evening? Using a bit of algorithmic trickery and some advanced machine learning (aka &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff typing eagerly into a shared Google Doc), we’ve made our best predictions of what this episode of &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; is likely to bring. And because we’re a little deranged from spending the week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;covering &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we also decided to turn it into a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6xILB"&gt;Behold: Elon &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google childcare workers ask for commute stipend in new petition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LnCBo7IkVZd4ycMtfFKPVKgTX5A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69254490/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUqK53"&gt;More than 200 Alphabet employees have &lt;a href="https://justiceforgcc.org/"&gt;signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; from Google childcare workers asking for a commute stipend. The petition calls for workers to be given an extra $1,500 per month to help pay for ride-shares, car rentals, or other transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZGIFd"&gt;Google is asking childcare workers and educators to return to in-person work on Monday, May 10th, while the company’s shuttle service remains suspended. Some make as little as $25 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAIPSR"&gt;“Transportation isn’t just a nice-to-have for us, it’s fundamental if we want to do our job,” said Denise Belardes, a childcare worker, in a press release. “We’re not the ones making hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. We do not have the option to work from home as other Googlers. We need this stipend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="To5FFX"&gt;Google maintains four childcare centers in the Bay Area, where workers help educate and care for the children of Google and Alphabet employees. Many of the workers employed there don’t live close to the office due to the prohibitively high cost of housing, so transportation is a particularly vital issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYT33l"&gt;During the pandemic, the workers began meeting with children over Google Meet, which made the transportation stipend unnecessary. But now, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/google-speeds-partial-office-reopening-and-puts-limits-on-remote-work.html#:~:text=Google%20employees%20will%20begin%20returning,will%20need%20to%20formally%20apply."&gt;Google starts to slowly bring employees back to the office&lt;/a&gt;, they’re being asked to return to in-person work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jpy5MV"&gt;In the petition, workers say Google did not respond well to the initial request. “When workers raised this issue, the corporate response was ‘transportation is just a perk, not a benefit,’” they wrote. “Shifting this cost to essential workers, who earn far less than the Googlers whose children they care for, is unacceptable. Google must do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBFzGs"&gt;The petition, which is addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai as well as other executives, is backed by the Alphabet Workers Union. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppWJNl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlnJeJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Nest Mini hits an all-time low — at least price-wise.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tWtukP"&gt;Whether you’ve fully committed to the smart home ecosystem or are just dabbling in the space for the first time, picking up a smart speaker is a no-brainer for most people. If you haven’t yet grabbed an Amazon or Google smart speaker, however, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1062332/1036?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00638us.html"&gt;Adorama is taking $31&lt;/a&gt; off the Google Nest Mini as part of its latest flash sale through Sunday, May 9th. Simply use the promo code &lt;strong&gt;EXTRAOFF11 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to knock an additional $11 off the listed sale price and receive free shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTeMeC"&gt;Like its predecessor, the second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;Google Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; offers a range of voice-activated features, only with bolder sound, capacitive touch zones, and an improved design that allows you to hang the device on your wall. At the core of the fabric-lined puck is Google Assistant, which allows you quickly set reminders, stream music, control your smart lights, and carry out a range of other tasks with nothing more than a quick “Hey, Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye17xF"&gt;The sound isn’t as robust as, say, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Google Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt;, but this marks the lowest price we’ve seen on the Nest Mini this year. It’s even available in two colors, chalk or charcoal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j7wJhr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zmZoJf"&gt;If you’re looking for additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22358371/mothers-day-gifts-ideas-best-mom-tech-gadgets"&gt;Mother’s Day gift ideas&lt;/a&gt; — and don’t mind opting for in-store pickup — we’ve also rounded up a set of eclectic ideas, from bath balms and AirPods to a classic pair of sandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CgVKOA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10443858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Impossible Foods eyes schools for new customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2nd China International Import Expo (CIIE) - Day 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRIV5LrRvrcoS5w6deNAM8vlbbw=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253559/1186664879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Impossible Burgers sit on a tray at the Impossible Foods Inc. booth on day five of the 2nd China International Import Expo (CIIE) at the National Exhibition and Convention Center on November 9, 2019 in Shanghai, China. | Photo by Gao Yuwen/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HhKWO4"&gt;Impossible Burgers will be making their way onto school menus across the US. The meatless burger just received the Child Nutrition Label from the USDA, which could make it easier for public schools to serve the product because the Impossible Burgers will be eligible for national school lunch funding. Impossible Foods hopes to offer up protein-packed lunches that don’t generate as much greenhouse gases as red meat. But slapping branding on foods served up to kids can still be harmful, even if the meals might be better for the environment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kv8XkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Companies should really keep their branding out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gxjz7"&gt;“Just on principle, we believe that schools should be commercial free,” says Marlene Schwartz, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. “Companies should really keep their branding out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwEwuu"&gt;Adults can carry loyalties to brands that they’re exposed to as kids, &lt;a href="https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/how-childhood-advertising-exposure-can-create-biased-product-eval"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown. That’s not great for their health if they’re developing a taste for junk food, so advocates have pushed for more nutritious options, including plant-based foods, in schools. Impossible Burgers are plant-based and have gotten the green light from the Food and Drug Administration to be sold in grocery stores (despite some activists’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418036/impossible-foods-legal-battle-key-ingredient-heme-fda"&gt;concerns over its key genetically engineered ingredient&lt;/a&gt;, heme, that the company says makes its burgers “taste like meat”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEspOV"&gt;The problem that Schwartz sees with Impossible Foods’ move into schools has more to do with its branding than with its product. (She’s unable to comment on whether Impossible Burgers are any better or worse than other foods.) If schools want to serve meals with less meat and a smaller carbon footprint, then they should serve the meatless patties without the Impossible trademark, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ANtFA"&gt;“When you allow a giant corporation to use that setting to get their brand in front of kids … It’s completely in conflict with the purpose of schools in the first place and I just think it’s completely unfair,” Schwartz says. “There’s something sacred about the school environment, that it should be a place where students aren’t being pressured to buy particular products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ueMGVv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Impossible™ Frito Pie”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1DFCu"&gt;Schools in Palo Alto, California; Aberdeen, Washington; Edmond, Oklahoma; and Union City, Oklahoma, will start pilot programs serving Impossible Burgers this month. The product won’t just appear in a bun, either. There will be “Impossible™ Street Tacos,” “Impossible™ Frito Pie,” and “Spaghetti with Impossible™ Meat Sauce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilOsfR"&gt;Impossible Foods seems to want to take more schools by storm soon. “Making Impossible™ products available everywhere people consume meat, which for kids often includes schools, is key to the mission of the company,” Pat Brown, CEO and Founder of Impossible Foods, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210506005414/en/Impossible-Foods-Secures-Child-Nutrition-Label-for-Impossible%E2%84%A2-Burger-Launches%C2%A0-Insights-Report-on-Kids-Climate-Change"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgbgk6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTMQRr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Expect generous promotions and shiny new plans as the expensive 5G buildout continues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PCj6nX"&gt;It’s a good year for old, crappy phones. The dusty old phone in your desk drawer running Android frozen-dessert-something-or-other — the one that might have a cracked screen — saw its stock go up recently with two generous trade-in promotions. T-Mobile and Verizon are both offering to take your old, damaged phone off your hands and replace it with a shiny new 5G model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUwvCI"&gt;There are a couple of reasons for this generosity. Verizon, in particular, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;written some big checks&lt;/a&gt; to pay for new C-band frequencies — highly desirable spectrum for 5G that offers good range and speed. The company has reassured its shareholders that the hefty expenditure will help grow its customer base and increase the amount of money it makes on existing accounts. It told investors at its March analyst event that “with C-band included, we think step-ups to premium [plans] will only accelerate.” So it’s unsurprising that the cracked phone deal requires a commitment to a “select unlimited plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="U0WiyG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long, lucrative relationship&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ByLkC"&gt;Meanwhile, T-Mobile wants to make the most of a relatively strong hand right now. It has taken every opportunity possible to declare itself the “leader in 5G” and is likewise focused on reaching new customers, getting a 5G device in their hands, and getting them hooked on its 5G network. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert talked up the success of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;new Magenta Max plan&lt;/a&gt; — an unlimited plan that doesn’t impose slowdowns after you reach a certain monthly data threshold — on the company’s first quarter earnings call as a kind of “if you build it, they will come” moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhtIFy"&gt;Customers on the plan use 70 percent more data than a typical LTE customer, and Sievert says they’re using their 5G data connection in situations when they might otherwise have looked for a public Wi-Fi network to join. “When you give somebody a true unlimited plan on a 5G phone that’s screaming fast on the biggest and best 5G network in this country, they use it.” That free 5G phone is just the start of what the carrier hopes will be a long and, ultimately, lucrative relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzcTYa"&gt;Outside of those two companies, US wireless carriers across the board are braced for big changes this year — the impact of which will be felt by the rest of us in one way or another. The beginning of the year saw telecom companies on the upswing compared to last year’s tumultuous first quarter, with most adding more customers than they did in this quarter last year. T-Mobile gained a net of 773,000 postpaid phone customers, and AT&amp;amp;T added 595,000, its highest number in 10 years. Across the industry, companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to welcome customers with stimulus checks ready to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPuCJp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies felt the positive impacts of retail stores reopening to customers with stimulus checks to spend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VHnP2f"&gt;While they’re in a better spot than they were when the country started shutting down this time a year ago, there are major hurdles to overcome in the near future. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, have a major project ahead of them in getting ready to deploy that newly won C-band — a costly venture on top of what they owe the federal government for the licenses. C-band is particularly important to those two companies, which are gambling on it to breathe life into their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;struggling nationwide 5G networks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYBUA3"&gt;Verizon is wasting no time; having pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, it’s on track to spend between $2 and 3 billion by the end of the year and says it’s already ordered half of the equipment it will need. AT&amp;amp;T, meanwhile, is proceeding with a more cautious outlook, citing uncertainties around stressed global supply chains, and that other auctions this year could help fill out the company’s spectrum portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PTDKZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon has pledged to spend $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuENHA"&gt;Meanwhile, this is all the more motivation for T-Mobile to push aggressively for more subscribers now while the other players catch up to its relatively strong position in spectrum holdings. The company &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Raises-2021-Guidance-as-Network-Leadership-Fuels-Industry-Leading-Growth-with-Strong-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;raised its investor guidance&lt;/a&gt; and now expects to add a net of between 4.4 and 4.9 million postpaid customers this year, up from 4.0 to 4.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVc1pi"&gt;There’s another storm on the horizon, too, one that could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of wireless customers: T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;impending shutdown of its old CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, which a large number of Boost Mobile (owned now by Dish) customers rely on. Dish says that T-Mobile is moving ahead with the shutdown much earlier than it said it would as an anti-competitive tactic, and Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks, more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;calling Sievert a “Magenta Grinch.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J6oc8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen’s cries of foul play have gotten more dire in recent weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1rBXS"&gt;The company has also asked the California Public Utilities Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-california-regulators-t-mobile-inquiry-reopen-9d87c61c-8349-440c-97eb-8cde807ba9bf.html"&gt;reopen the Sprint / T-Mobile merger case&lt;/a&gt;, and it has appealed to Capitol Hill lawmakers to review the situation. If the shutdown goes ahead as currently planned, lots of Boost Mobile customers will be shopping for a new phone soon — and potentially even a new wireless provider, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0ectx"&gt;So what’s next? For one, we can expect the aggressive play for new customers to continue, along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"&gt;dull roar of the 5G Hype Machine&lt;/a&gt; we’re all tired of hearing by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6ScUNY"&gt;In addition to the device offers, your carrier might try to upsell you to one of those premium unlimited plans if you do upgrade to a 5G device. Verizon is committed to those customer “step-ups,” and Sievert hinted that more Magenta Max-type offerings may be on the way, saying the plan is “only the beginning.” So if you do decide to dust off that old phone and turn it in for a new device this year, more power to you — might as well put an old piece of tech to work for you. Just be sure to take a good look at the fine print on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Assistant will sing you a song about getting vaccinated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Assistant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q1XT27l8npf8ZyfN8F364VSvaRo=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69253157/acastro_180510_1777_google_assistant_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G0uqwM"&gt;Many of us are excited that COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available in the US, and it seems like Google Assistant is joining in. In fact, it’s got a song to share about it (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/07/google-assistant-hopes-the-medium-of-song-will-persuade-you-to-get-a-covid-vaccine/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9svoPD"&gt;You can listen to the song yourself by asking Google Assistant to “sing the vaccine song,” but I’ve also recorded it. Take a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PadBRX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy Friday, here’s a song &lt;a href="https://t.co/hetzPYP8QD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hetzPYP8QD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1390714375447584770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tngQgk"&gt;Okay, hmm... where to start? I’ll give the music some props. It’s got a fun beat with a kind of crispy-sounding snare. I’d also call the synths “tastefully restrained.” Assistant will also, I discovered, sing the song in either a male- or female-sounding voice, depending on your settings. The range!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rttDN5"&gt;Unfortunately, the lyrics aren’t great. If you’re not able to listen, here’s a sample:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Let’s celebrate that we have the vaccine To help us bring a change to this old routine It can help us build our immunities While taking care of our communities" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vvqNVEUSGOsRQIJJM9_epaA4OfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22498904/Screenshot_20210507_101654.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be fair, the subject matter doesn’t lend itself well to song.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xwphiB"&gt;Yeah, the presentation isn’t really helped by the emoji that punctuate each line. I can fully support the message: my hat’s off to the people who worked hard on developing the vaccines, and we should all get it so we can return back to normal. But I don’t think the best messenger is a digital assistant. I also doubt it’ll be that convincing to people who are distrustful of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKUxYH"&gt;(Also, who’s pining for handshakes to come back?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz7gBi"&gt;I’m feeling a strong four to a light five on this one. &lt;/p&gt;
