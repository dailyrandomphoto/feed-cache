    <title>The Windows 11 app store is already more useful after just a week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PcQIieyTigfBdp144JdvNnF4YOY=/186x0:2292x1404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541870/microsoft_store_windows_11_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Microsoft Store on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bbYhnF"&gt;Microsoft’s dysfunctional app store for Windows, the Microsoft Store, is finally improving under Windows 11. While there’s a UI overhaul and some speed improvements, the key change is allowing more apps into the store. In just the past week alone, some popular apps have started to appear in the Microsoft Store on Windows 11, making it more useful than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EuS3N"&gt;OBS Studio, Zoom, Canva, WinZip, and Adobe Acrobat Reader have all made their way to the Microsoft Store in the past week, alongside Microsoft Edge browser extensions. These early additions, during a beta period for Windows 11, are a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1YJJK"&gt;The Microsoft Store is changing on Windows 11, and eventually Windows 10, to include any traditional desktop apps. Microsoft previously restricted developers to its Universal Windows Apps, before then allowing some desktop apps that were packaged to use its store for updates. Now any app can be part of the store, a move that aligns with the Windows Package Manager Microsoft released last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNdcomXi_a9HPtsWLh3hiRPZtWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690995/store.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom is now part of the Microsoft Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wI01rT"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows Package Manager quickly became better than the Windows store in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21264739/microsoft-windows-package-manager-preview-download"&gt;less than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, offering apps like Zoom and WinRAR that were missing from the main store. The package manager has been growing steadily over the past year, and now includes Discord, Google Chrome, Firefox, and many other popular apps. There’s even a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498369/winstall-windows-package-manager-scripts-app-packs"&gt;great third-party web interface&lt;/a&gt; you can use with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQL6zY"&gt;The Microsoft Store is essentially now a frontend for the Windows Package Manager and the WinGet command that’s used to install apps from Microsoft’s repository. That should mean we’ll see even more apps appear in the store in the coming weeks. Mozilla, for example, &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1549103#c5"&gt;has hinted&lt;/a&gt; that Firefox will be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDFQgN"&gt;We may even eventually see rival app stores in the Microsoft Store, like Steam or the Epic Games Store. Windows chief Panos Panay said the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550103/microsoft-new-windows-app-store-steam-welcome"&gt;open to having Steam or the Epic Games Store in the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, and it would likely work as a way to link out to apps and games available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rg7HG_6leWoMEzB6v6UGbhqhtI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699670/QFBhodt.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft still has a lot of work to do on the store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ygbVMe"&gt;Part of the new store’s appeal for developers is allowing apps with their own update systems, but also a change by Microsoft to let developers keep 100 percent of the revenue from apps if they use alternative payment platforms. This change &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;doesn’t apply to games&lt;/a&gt;, however. It will take some time until we see just how well Microsoft’s reduced cut of game revenues, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;from 30 to 12 percent starting on August 1st&lt;/a&gt;, will impact the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIEPD0"&gt;While these new app additions are useful, there’s still much work to be done. The store is full of junk apps, with many fake apps, guides, and crapware still showing up in search results. It’s going to take Microsoft some time to clean this part of the store up, particularly because developers have abandoned the Microsoft Store for so long that many of these junk apps are now in the top free apps section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bosird"&gt;Either way, the Microsoft Store is definitely heading in the right direction, after a decade of being largely ignored. If it can get to the point of having every useful and popular app listed, then that’s a great improvement for Windows users who will no longer have to search around the web to find a trusted installer for their favorite apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lynk &amp; Co will make you rethink outdated ideas of car ownership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7wppZsakFyk1FiHcoKJgxMGPiI=/0x170:2040x1530/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541838/verge_IMG_6863_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new day is coming.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Nguyen Tran&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A car that gets cheaper every time you share it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tY9mbf"&gt;“This is not a car, this is different” is how &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;, a company spawned by Volvo and Geely, is positioning the launch of its 01 plug-in hybrid, a compact SUV built from the ground up to share. The more you share its digital key the less you pay each month, possibly even turning a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="q6GadZ"&gt;It’s a bold experiment that I was able to preview in a test vehicle in Amsterdam, where Lynk &amp;amp; Co is staging its first salvo against a century of car ownership mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaPGVX"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co first announced its ambitious approach to car sharing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13328674/lynk-and-co-geely-connected-car-volvo-launch-official"&gt;five years ago&lt;/a&gt; in its home city of Gothenburg, Sweden, emboldened by studies that say cars sit unused 96 percent of the time. That’s valuable real estate that could otherwise be returned to people. So it’s with some anticipation that I set out for my week with a production 01 PHEV running pre-production sharing software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IuCoVC2igPYkGd1HMBIWUIsNwUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691478/verge_IMG_8411_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A VW Up from Geenwheels next to the Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 PHEV in Amsterdam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eavED5"&gt;Amsterdam was chosen as Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s launch city for a variety of reasons, chief among them is its multi-modal inhabitants’ intimacy with car-sharing services. My Dutch family, for example, has never owned a car, nor do most of my friends. Instead we use fleet sharing services like Greenwheels, Mywheels, or Share Now. Otherwise we use a personal car-sharing service like Snappcar when looking for &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/auto-huren/auto/delorean-dmc-12/4d2f2479-33f1-49e8-a9ed-d75f5b189934?searchId=795a04f5-f74d-4f70-804f-344c392a0c20&amp;amp;searchSessionId=bc8958c0-e641-4f3c-bcbc-79dc41bf92da"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/auto-huren/auto/ford-%28usa%29-mustang/5a5fac28-92d0-42c3-8775-80e448776d5e?searchId=0af2baf6-0c0e-4770-809d-7405e833353c&amp;amp;searchSessionId=bc8958c0-e641-4f3c-bcbc-79dc41bf92da"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/auto-huren/auto/volkswagen-lt/fdf2486a-ddbd-4d0e-911f-370437cd93e5?searchId=696b4b00-a809-49a1-9039-2b908f212912&amp;amp;searchSessionId=bc8958c0-e641-4f3c-bcbc-79dc41bf92da"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; to drive. As much as we love our electric bicycles, a car is often needed when an e-scooter, taxi, bus, or train just won’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM9EsP"&gt;After a week of testing I’ve come away increasingly optimistic about Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s chances, not only to achieve its revenue goals but also its broader societal goal of making people realize that traditional ideas of car ownership, especially in densely populated cities, are woefully outdated. My optimism is fueled by three things: the company’s early success in attracting members, driving the 01 for a few hundred kilometers, and testing an early beta version of the sharing service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVSYN6IPXVmgMOVZWfRQv9KV0wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691548/verge_DSC_4713_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memberships are off to an aggressive start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qDLDxX"&gt;A PROMISING START&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhPoxa"&gt;You can buy a Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 outright for €39,000, but most people are opting for &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/month-to-month-details"&gt;memberships that cost €500 each month&lt;/a&gt;. That’s about what you’d pay each month on a &lt;em&gt;four-year&lt;/em&gt; lease for a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.volvocars.com%2Fnl%2Flease-en-financiering%2Fproducten%2Ffinancieren%2Fvolvo-private-lease&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22557411%2Flynk-co-01-cheaper-as-you-share-volvo-geely-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comparable Volvo XC40&lt;/a&gt; which is built upon the same platform as the 01. Only with Lynk &amp;amp; Co you can cancel the agreement at any time. Better yet, you can divide the monthly fee with family and friends, or reduce it further by lending the car out to a general pool of neighbors and tourists at an hourly or daily rate, all of which Lynk &amp;amp; Co will facilitate (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhkuEC"&gt;Membership includes 1,250km (777 miles) of driving per month with each extra kilometer costing €0.15, with unused kilometers carrying over to the next month. The €500/month fee covers insurance, warranty repairs, roadside assistance, and maintenance by Volvo’s dealer network. And because the 01 uses a digital key, Volvo can pick up your car, service it, and return it while you go about your activities. (You get a loaner vehicle if service needs more than a day.) The monthly fee doesn’t cover repairs out of warranty, fuel costs, charging fees, or any costs associated with parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Td41ti"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s manager of press relations, Cecilia Hedlund, tells me that only about 10 percent of paying customers actually buy the car, with the rest signing up for the €500 monthly memberships. So far they’ve attracted almost double the number of paying month-to-month members as expected for all of 2021, and we’re only six months into the year. Of the 9,000 memberships expected, Hedlund says it already has 16,000 members signed up to pay monthly subscriptions for a car, with most residing in Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, and Belgium. That number is important because Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s financial success stems from selling memberships, not from the small transaction fees it gets from facilitating each car share. The company is now busy ramping up deliveries with about 300 cars delivered so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTdQHz"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co has sold a non-shareable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/28/16709932/lynk-co-01-suv-release-date-china"&gt;01 model in China since 2017&lt;/a&gt;. The 01 I’ve been testing has been thoroughly updated for Europe, both inside and out, with sharing made possible through the implementation of &lt;a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/cases/2017/lynkco-cloud-based-solution"&gt;Ericsson’s Connected Vehicle Cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXeqepsD9v7P8MQi80Yf0msLSh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691492/verge_DSC_5450_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company has almost double the number of paying members expected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BhZVsC"&gt;THE CAR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AT7PcE"&gt;I’m not a car guy, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/3/9841104/why-own-a-car-when-you-can-share-one-instead"&gt;I am a car &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; guy&lt;/a&gt;, having used a multitude of sharing services since at least 2014. The 01 is far nicer than any of the fleet cars available to share in Amsterdam, though I do wish it was fully electric. (An EV is coming, but not any time soon, I’m told.) The cars from fleet sharing services tend to be exceedingly boring base models like the VW Up! or Citroën C1 that come slathered in external advertising. Every 01 ships without ads and comes &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/car/car-specifications-features"&gt;fully equipped&lt;/a&gt; to restore some dignity to using a shared vehicle. All 01s are the same — the only option for members is the choice of blue or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7Gb43"&gt;Because it’s Volvo, the 01 comes standard with most modern &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/car/car-specifications-features#1a5ec65a-a17d-4fea-951e-05ed65b07d4d;3"&gt;safety features&lt;/a&gt; like adaptive cruise control, emergency braking and forward collision warnings, automatic LED lights and rain sensors, driver alertness control, blind spot detection, a camera for backing up, security alarm, and more. Thankfully, sensors on the front, rear, and sides of the compact SUV enable a semi-autonomous parking feature which is very useful for the tiny parking spots available in dense European cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDH3VX"&gt;It’s also loaded with conveniences like a powered driver seat with memory presets, large panoramic sunroof, powered tailgate, heated seats, automatic AC with zone control, a punchy ten speaker Infinity sound system, and a built-in hands-free voice assistant named Frank (at least on my car).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5n3rt0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10631212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azMdXH"&gt;The 01 is fitted with two large displays. There’s a 12.7 inch touchscreen display on the center console with support for both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. But the built-in turn-by-turn navigation provided by &lt;a href="https://www.here.com"&gt;Here Technologies&lt;/a&gt; on the 12.3 inch instrument cluster in front of the driver proved superior to both Google and Apple Maps for navigating Dutch roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw68Ep"&gt;To keep your devices charged there’s a wireless charging pad between the driver and front-passenger seats. Otherwise, your devices can be juiced from any of four USB jacks (two front, two rear), or two 12V outlets (front and in the rear cargo area). You can also save on your phone’s data plan when connected to the car’s Wi-Fi hotspot thanks to Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s built-in 4G data. It’s limited to 5GB a month but that can be extended with a call to Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s engagement center under a fair-use policy (borrowers can not use the car’s hotspot). Hell, there’s even an integrated dashcam with 64GB of storage and a second in-car selfie camera for god knows what reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vUEGXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seats made from recycled fishing nets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LLp12P"&gt;The interior surfaces look and feel good to the touch, including the eco-friendly textile coverings on the seats made from recycled fishing nets. The Econyl fabric easily withstood my dog’s claws and resisted the grime we tracked in while kitesurfing the muddy shores of Dutch waterways. The seats remained comfortable on chilly mornings and hot afternoons, even against bare thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jJQe9"&gt;And because it’s built to share, the 01 has a number of useful remote monitoring features. For example, I could see the status of the climate control system, if the windows were up, or if a door was left open or unlocked from the comfort of my home. I could even lock or unlock the doors. The Lynk &amp;amp; Co app also informed me of the fuel remaining and charge on the battery, any service warnings, and current location of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYlwmp"&gt;It really was a joy to drive around in something so modern and high-spec after years of drudgery spent inside entry-level automobiles. The 261hp provided by the 01 was thrilling compared to the 60hp we’re used to from fleet sharing vehicles. And the 70km range on battery was enough to reach the beach and back, and for my wife to drive to work where she could easily charge the car from a standard power outlet before her journey home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YN0_-atBjuOjd2YaEeLaP-6GKZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691463/verge_DSC_5507_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A preview of the Lynk &amp;amp; Co app shown here in beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0arqQN"&gt;SHARING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="s4Hn8C"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s sharing model allows paying members to lend their cars to &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/sharing/borrow-the-01"&gt;free members&lt;/a&gt; who sign up just to borrow. Signing up isn’t exactly frictionless though, as you have to upload a valid driver’s license and photo, enter payment details, and pass both credit and identity checks. Standard stuff for car-sharing services and traditional rental car companies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmZR5B"&gt;To be successful, car-sharing companies must maintain a magic ratio of vehicles-to-borrowers. Too many vehicles and expenses will outpace revenue. Not enough vehicles and frustrated borrowers will jump to a competitor. In my neighborhood alone, I have four Greenwheels sitting in dedicated city-allocated parking spots within a two-block radius, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhxKf"&gt;It’s hard to imagine Lynk &amp;amp; Co achieving that kind of density anytime soon. In fact, Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s head of car sharing, Adam Broadbent, tells me that the company won’t meet its target ratio of ten borrowers (free members) to every vehicle at launch of the sharing service in Q3. Nevertheless, it knows that most paying members are keen to become lenders in order to bring down their monthly payments and maximize vehicle use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnaZU7"&gt;To compensate for this lack of borrower-to-lender density, later this year, but soon after launch, the company will add a friends and family lending option. Paying members will be able to share digital keys with a small group of trusted people who agree to share the monthly fee. One person, however, will still be on the hook to sign up and pay for the €500/month membership, I’m told. How Lynk &amp;amp; Co will facilitate this to ensure everyone is paying their fair share for usage is still unclear. The beta software I tested didn’t include a friends and family sharing option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fDDfvZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10631204"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PB1DyQ"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co let me preview a beta version of the Lynk &amp;amp; Co app launching in Q3. Sharing is straightforward, allowing lenders (paying members with cars) to set the time, location, price, and conditions of borrowing. Once shared, the car appears on a map showing its availability to free members. Members with cars can also initiate sharing from the car’s display, though I wasn’t able to test that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhXJ5M"&gt;Borrowing a car is as simple as agreeing to the terms set by the lender. Once agreed, a digital key is sent to the borrower which can be used to unlock the car via the Lynk &amp;amp; Co app (using Bluetooth). Lenders and borrowers have star ratings, and cars can be filtered by time and location, and any additional equipment like roof rack, tow hook, or child seat. Importantly, kilometers used by borrowers do not apply to the monthly cap of the lender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzq3po"&gt;The digital key exchange means the borrower and lender never have to meet in person. But Lynk &amp;amp; Co offers lenders some additional protection from creeps by withholding the exact location of the car until 30 minutes before the booking starts, giving the lender time to park the car within the advertised start / end locations, and as far away from their home or business as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUhti5"&gt;I was able to test a lender / borrower scenario using two developer phones (one setup as the lender, the other the borrower) provided by Lynk &amp;amp; Co. In my live test, the borrower phone connected to the lender’s car when I was about five feet (1.5 meters) from it, prompting me to submit a condition report, including five photos taken from around the car at various angles. Only after uploading the photos did the digital key become active on the borrower phone, allowing me to unlock the car. Once inside, the borrower can log into their profile on the center console to download all their preferences. Both the phone and in-car console apps will guide the borrower through the sharing experience, with a countdown timer and reminder to drop-off the lender’s car at the agreed upon time, fuel level, and destination area. I wasn’t able to test these borrower features, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5yjS1"&gt;When the lending period is over, the borrower must again upload five photos to confirm the external condition. Only then can the borrower complete the booking, notifying the lender that the car has been returned. (A booking can be extended by up to two additional hours with approval from the lender.) Lynk &amp;amp; Co checks the fuel level at the start and end of the booking and uses the delta to either add or take money off the final price. The car must also be at least as clean as the borrower found it, otherwise penalties could be incurred. Lynk &amp;amp; Co says it adds a €100 buffer to every reservation to cover costs of booking extensions, late returns, and fuel costs, and will provide lenders with all information needed to challenge any traffic tickets incurred by a borrower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1qP5Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sharing can quickly offset that €500/mth membership fee&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ngl4TG"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s Broadbent anticipates sharing prices to be around €5 to €10 per hour, and €50 to €100 to borrow it for a day. For comparison, owners of nearby Volvo SUVs on the Snappcar sharing service list their cars for between €65 and €110 per day. If you only need your Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 during the week, for example, you can see how quickly sharing can offset that €500/mth membership fee. Broadbent says that a recommended pricing feature is coming to help members with cars maximize profits when sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B8jci"&gt;Right now there’s no ability for a lender to schedule a car’s availability only on weekends or a set number of days during the week in the beta app I tested, but that’s coming, says Broadbent. I work from home so I could easily share the car Monday through Friday and block it out for my personal use on weekends. In such a scenario, I could even turn a profit once enough borrowers were vying for my car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5YyGw"&gt;Airport sharing is another feature that’s coming. Members with cars can drive to the airport and travelers flying in would get precise directions along with a digital key to use the car while you’re out of town. At the moment, Lynk &amp;amp; Co only accepts category B drivers licenses from a list of 30 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes a car is the only mode of transportation that will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="tXJPhC"&gt;For what it’s worth, I asked around my own social circle to see who’d be interested in sharing an 01. Two out of four of my friends already using sharing services responded positively with what I’d describe as keen interest, while the other two said it sounded promising but wanted more information. For example, how will friends and family sharing be facilitated, and how will monthly bills be calculated so that fuel / energy costs and usage are all factored in fairly? Understandably, the person who orders a Jack and Coke at the bar doesn’t want to subsidize someone else’s &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/the-real-reason-why-pappy-van-winkle-is-so-expensive"&gt;Pappy Van Winkle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9DxqR"&gt;When I look at my own car-sharing bill for the last year, I see months where I’ve paid over €400 and others that cost me less than €50 (including the gas). It averages out to about €200/mth over the long term. While I’m willing to pay more for a more luxurious car that’s better suited to my active family of five (plus dog), and one that’s shared with a limited trusted group that won’t leave McDonalds bags in the footwells, I also think I’d want to share with at least two other parties to keep costs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M3MI3e"&gt;“Owning” a Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 really does have the potential to be different. The fact that I’m actively considering paying €500 a month to become a member says a lot about my experience with the car ahead of its official Q3 sharing launch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is getting an ultra-limited release in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixpGO5NDQgFFdSFUavpoihg_A3w=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541768/DSCF7720_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LbPe5P"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is finally going on sale in India in limited quantities. The company had announced its latest flagship smartphone all the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been near-impossible to buy one outside of China ever since. The phone sold out instantly in the UK in May, suggesting very limited stock, and last month Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1400042494792921089"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Indian launch would be delayed “due to circumstances beyond our control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgoLQA"&gt;Now, Xiaomi has announced details of how people in India will actually be able to buy one, as long as they’re willing to jump through a few hoops. Customers will need to buy an “ultra gift card” for Rs. 1,999 (~$27) &lt;a href="https://in.event.mi.com/in/mi-11-ultra-register"&gt;on the Mi.com website&lt;/a&gt;, which can later be redeemed against the price of the Mi 11 Ultra and includes some bonuses like two free screen replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0QVgbI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⚡️&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mi11Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Mi11Ultra&lt;/a&gt;⚡️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Register for the first sale by purchasing the ultra gift card, get guaranteed access to sale &amp;amp; other benefits  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  2 Free Screen Replacements&lt;br&gt;  Ultra Merchandise Superfan Box&lt;br&gt;  Times Prime Annual Membership&lt;br&gt;  Extra F-code&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Know more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d"&gt;https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/61x4jYCREP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/61x4jYCREP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mi India (@XiaomiIndia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1411280371396669440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="18WscM"&gt;The Mi 11 Ultra itself starts at Rs. 69,999 (~$940) in India. Xiaomi hasn’t said how long the gift cards will be available for, how many phones it’ll make available for purchase, or when they’ll ship, but it’s describing the release as a “limited-quantity sale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3ELbM"&gt;Xiaomi’s key selling point for the Mi 11 Ultra over its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;very good&lt;/a&gt;) non-ultra sibling is an all-new camera system. The main camera has a large 1/1.12-inch 50-megapixel sensor, and there are also 48-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto modules. All of this is housed in a gigantic camera bump complete with a secondary OLED screen that can serve as a viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eco7pE"&gt;I’ve been using the Mi 11 Ultra for a while now — stay tuned for our review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Many Saints of Newark, Foundation, Beckett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6F3nE015CItdqc1LFXCKEa6d2c=/169x0:1338x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541060/michael_gandolfini.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Gandolfini stars as Tony Soprano in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFfeGRbWLQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7EQHx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; returned to its very weird and funny roots this week and introduced Mandy Patinkin as a — let’s say “unconventional” judge, and it’s as if my favorite character from &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; got a new job. I know everyone is probably maxed out on how many streaming channels they can/want to subscribe to, but &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is reason enough to at least check out Paramount Plus. And I have no idea what’s going to happen on the next episode of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; but (mild spoiler ahead!) I can’t imagine the two characters who got pruned will stay pruned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2awLf"&gt;This week we finally get a first look at the prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and a new look at the new&lt;em&gt; Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0roKoN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAFfeGRbWLQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qOwkcG"&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PySsLR"&gt;In this prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano, the iconic role that won his father James multiple awards. Michael is a young Tony in what &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/many-saints-of-newark-trailer-sopranos-movie-alan-taylor"&gt;director Alan Taylor&lt;/a&gt; says is the story of Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola)— father of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;’ Christopher— the man who made Tony into who he became. We get a glimpse of Vera Farmiga as Livia, who looks like she plays the matriarch as ice cold as the late, great Nancy Marchand did. Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, and Ray Liotta also star in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max October 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4sDcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPT_PNucTWE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="olT7eW"&gt;Beckett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TVfA1V"&gt;An American tourist vacationing in Greece gets into a car accident, and when he wakes up, he’s embroiled in a conspiracy and people are shooting at him. Mr. Beckett does not appear to have the same skill set as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKaB5dvQ4g&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;Jason Bourne&lt;/a&gt;, however, which will probably make things a bit more difficult as he tries to figure out what the hell is going on and attempts to get to the US Embassy. John David Washington and Alicia Vikander star in &lt;em&gt;Beckett,&lt;/em&gt; which hits Netflix August 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKjod3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvOAA1U0li8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ncYdoF"&gt;Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1KMEPh"&gt;The second teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; finally gives us a release date for this long-awaited series based on the Isaac Asimov novels. The downfall of the Galactic Empire has been predicted by Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), so it has to build a foundation to preserve mankind’s knowledge. Along with Harris, Lee Pace stars as Brother Day, and Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres September 24th on Apple TV Plus, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lplJZ7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXdEeRBh9Zk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KEjKlH"&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="umjdTq"&gt;We got a teaser of the Kevin Smith revival of He-Man’s adventures in June, and now we get the full trailer. It’s not a retelling of the He-Man story, but rather picks up where the original TV show concluded in 1985. Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lena Headley, and Mark Hamill (as Skeletor) voice characters in &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe,&lt;/em&gt; which debuts on Netflix July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uUUatE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BSSoD73TSk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fao446"&gt;Jolt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN8Qt"&gt;This trailer has Kate Beckinsale kicking things and beating people up but she isn’t a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;; instead she has a rare disorder that makes her rage out if she doesn’t get regular shock treatments from Stanley Tucci. Naturally she meets a guy who doesn’t freak out at her shocking condition (sorry) and of course he gets killed and the cops think she did it so then she has to do some revenge-kicking. Bobby Cannavale, Jai Courtney, Laverne Cox, and Susan Sarandon also star in &lt;em&gt;Jolt&lt;/em&gt; which comes to Amazon Prime Video July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tykCLL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzMpki"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends hackers interrupt games with messages about Titanfall hacking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="‘Apex Legends’ - Skulltown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-KQcVCcR-XEFqgQYe9GR7eRElg=/114x0:1341x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540942/apex_screenshot_world_skulltown.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;‘Apex Legends’ | Respawn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Afq8Ds"&gt;Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale shooter &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; has proven to be a hit, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;over 100 million unique players&lt;/a&gt;, and counted over 300,000 people playing on Steam &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RKRigney/status/1389947124419375111"&gt;at one time in May&lt;/a&gt;. But an issue bubbling over from its earlier &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; games is now having an impact on &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;, as reports across social media show players running into messages from people hacking the game with a “Save Titanfall” message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2YmS8"&gt;Respawn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411777384294977536"&gt;acknowledged the issues on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, saying “We are aware of and actively investigating issues impacting @PlayApex playlists that are preventing players from getting into matches.” In a follow-up tweet at 7PM, the developer said these attacks don’t put the personal information of players at risk, and that the team is testing a fix. As of 10:15PM, the developer appeared confident that problems for Apex Legends are resolved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="spx52n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re testing a fix now and will update when we have more confidence. Additional updates may be required. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, we’ve determined that this attack—while disruptive—has not put players’ personal information or accounts at risk. More updates to come as we make progress.&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411822173132627977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="y3EjMA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve confirmed that matchmaking has been restored. We’re keeping an eye on things but believe the issue to be resolved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your patience, Legends.&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411871551213944837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7yiYyh"&gt;The issue went on for hours, and when players were affected, they couldn’t queue for new games. All of this happened at the same time that &lt;em&gt;Apex &lt;/em&gt;is hosting a special event drawing players back to the original versions of its first two maps (including divisive areas like Skulltown, pictured above). As &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-hackers-fill-game-with-messages-complainin-1847228032"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report, the messages have been appearing for players on PC, Xbox One and PS4. I joined a game on PC and when the match was over, I was greeted with the following message pointing to a “Save Titanfall” website. After Respawn indicated the problems were over, I managed to play a few matches without any odd messages or matchmaking problems beyond the usual ones, like not getting paired with enough/any teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5haWtbeOg2ySzfZmsSEJtnqo2yA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699225/SAVETITANFALL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yqoaaE"&gt;It appears that whoever is behind this attack is doing it because of similar issues that have affected the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall &lt;/em&gt;games going back years. A problem attributed to a single person kicked players out of&lt;em&gt; Titanfall 1&lt;/em&gt; sessions on PC and inundated them with racist messages, making the multiplayer-only title largely unplayable, in an issue &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/titanfall/titanfall-hackers"&gt;dating back to 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3SPxb"&gt;In recent months Respawn has tweeted that “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1379204515748929538"&gt;help is coming ASAP&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1395446711682838530"&gt;the team is investigating&lt;/a&gt;” problems like DDOS attacks on the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; series, but the issues continue. With hacking becoming a game-stopping problem for a franchise that EA is counting on to provide over $750 million in net bookings during its 2022 financial year, solutions can’t wait much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6L--dHuUbfXRldeiadfgIhLMUm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699226/apex_net_bookings_2021.jpg"&gt;

    <title>Researcher finds certain network names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9xZla"&gt;A security researcher has found that certain Wi-Fi networks with the percent symbol (%) in their names can disable Wi-Fi on iPhones and other iOS devices. Carl Schou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that if an iPhone comes within range of a network named %secretclub%power, the device won’t be able to use Wi-Fi or any related features, and even after resetting network settings, the bug may continue to render Wi-Fi on the device unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VB7vyX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can permanently disable any iOS device's WiFI by hosting a public WiFi named %secretclub%power&lt;br&gt;Resetting network settings is not guaranteed to restore functionality.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/infosec?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#infosec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/0day?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#0day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Carl Schou (@vm_call) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vm_call/status/1411630091038203909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aiJve1"&gt;A few weeks ago, Schou and his not-for-profit group, &lt;a href="https://secret.club/"&gt;Secret Club&lt;/a&gt;, which reverse-engineers software for research purposes,&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt; found that if an iPhone connected&lt;/a&gt; to a network with the SSiD name %p%s%s%s%s%n it would cause a bug in iOS’ networking stack that would disable its Wi-Fi, and system networking features like AirDrop would become unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NikSyL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/19/a-specific-network-name-can-completely-disable-wi-fi-on-your-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; offered&lt;/a&gt; a possible explanation for the weird bug: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QmbFJV"&gt;the ‘%[character]’ syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the ‘%n’ specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="az5wDQ"&gt;We’ve reached out to Apple to see if it’s working on a fix, and will update if we hear back from them. But as&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the bug can likely be avoided by not connecting to Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their names. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Trump advisor’s Gettr platform appeared to be briefly hacked Sunday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e-NJ98MlkjsLG70g1s-sBF4tCvI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540385/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kHgHNW"&gt;Several verified profile pages on Gettr, the new social media platform from Jason Miller, once an advisor to former President Trump, were apparently hacked and defaced briefly on Sunday (via &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gettr-trump-allies-get-accounts-hacked-july-4-launch-day-2021-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ClrE7"&gt;The accounts of several well-known Republicans, including Miller, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had their pages’ header images replaced with the same message: “@JubaBaghdad was here :) ^^ free palestine ^^.” according to screenshots. Twitter user @JubaBaghdad told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; it was easy to hack the pages and that he had done it “just for fun.” Most of the affected profiles appeared to be back to normal at the time of publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W24jZT"&gt;Zachary Petrizzo, a writer for &lt;em&gt;Salon&lt;/em&gt;, posted screenshots on Twitter of what the pages looked like: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Oa4XYJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Jason Miller's new right-wing social media site "Gettr" was hacked this morning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cncddw9RZ9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cncddw9RZ9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1411697118079860741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XlEqr"&gt;Miller said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the problem was detected and “sealed in a matter of minutes, and all the intruder was able to accomplish was to change a few user names.” He added that Gettr had already had “more than half a million users” sign up for the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZIUD"&gt;Gettr was supposed to have its official launch today, July 4th. It had a soft launch in June, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, and plans to host three-minute videos, 777-character posts, and live streaming video. Its app is live in Google and Apple’s app stores, with the tagline “Marketplace of Ideas.” The app’s “about” section describes it as “a brand new social media platform founded on the principles of free speech, independent thought, and rejecting political censorship and ‘cancel culture.’” The app has an M for “mature” rating, meaning it’s intended for users 17 and older. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGuzuX"&gt;After Trump was banned from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in January following the insurrection at the Capitol building, he said he planned to launch his own social platform. A blog titled “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” launched in May on his website, but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464930/donald-trump-blog-facebook-twitter-social-media-platform"&gt;shut down and archived in June&lt;/a&gt;. Miller said at the time that the website was not intended to be Trump’s social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JNcSs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-trump-adviser-jason-miller-new-social-app-gettr-backed-by-guo-wengui-tied-foundation-11625199130"&gt;Miller told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that Trump wasn’t on Gettr at that point. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/former-trump-aide-starts-social-media-platform-without-old-boss?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the former president did not have plans to join Gettr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHsuOD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 4th 2:22PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Gettr CEO Miller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trese mashes a police procedural with a sinister supernatural world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fu63ZPt5Wos6BPacJL3OPnU2MJQ=/33x0:1155x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540341/Screen_Shot_2021_07_02_at_1.34.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKeCle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This biweekly &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nATKX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526762/netflix-trese-philippine-folklore-anime-horror-comic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most interesting new shows on Netflix, a gritty detective story set in a modern-day Manilla beset by all kinds of supernatural forces. It’s great, but it also ends quickly: the debut season is only six episodes long. Luckily, if you’re looking for more of Alexandra Trese, there’s plenty to dig into with the books on which the show is based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="500PJR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; follows the titular Alexandra Trese, a Manilla resident who owns a club called Diabolical, but more interestingly, is also a consulting detective of sorts. Basically, whenever police officer Captain Guerrero comes across a crime he can’t explain, he calls Trese for her expertise on the city’s dark supernatural underworld. She’s the link between the human world and the magical, helping to keep the balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jult9I"&gt;The series is a mashup of genres. It’s structured like a police procedural, with each chapter covering a different crime. That could be terrifying — and hungry — &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiyanak"&gt;baby creatures&lt;/a&gt; that are terrorizing a mall parking lot, or a dead body that was found with a mysterious jar of ground-up mermaid bones. These supernatural elements lend the story a strong horror vibe, which is accentuated by the grisly, black-and-white art. The places Trese ventures are not places you’d want to go. It’s not just scary, though, as many of the stories are tinged with sadness, like a fading actress who will do anything to stay in the spotlight, or a raging fire monster trying to bring back a lost love. There’s drag racing, zombies, and a monster informant that just &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qeJ31tSt4bbkdBiclextkCtaTJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22696357/TRESE_VOL1_REVIEW_pg_8.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4G7hF"&gt;For fans of folklore creatures, &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; is also a great chance to dig into the rich world of monsters from the Philippines. Not only are they the focal point of the stories, but each issue ends with handwritten notes from Trese’s father, which detail the specifics of various creatures, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiyanak"&gt;the vampire-esque tiyanak&lt;/a&gt; or god-like creatures that can control fire, lightning, or wind. Trese both works with and fights against these creatures; at almost all times she’s accompanied by a pair of violence-loving twins who wear creepy masks, one smiling and the other frowning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Low33f"&gt;If you’re into stories like &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Trese &lt;/em&gt;should be right up your alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="firstHeading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it by? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; was created by writer Budjette Tan and artist Kajo Baldisimo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ln88IX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it? &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re into the concept (or enjoyed the show), the good news is that there are a lot of &lt;em&gt;Trese&lt;/em&gt; books to explore. The series is available digitally through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixology.com%2FTrese%2Fcomics-series%2F149388&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22560965%2Ftrese-review-supernatural-detective-comic-netflix" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Comixology&lt;/a&gt;; the first volume is out now, with the second due on July 21st and the third on September 29th. In print, the first two volumes are available now, &lt;a href="https://ablazepublishing.com/trese_category.html"&gt;published by Ablaze&lt;/a&gt;, while the third is due out in September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music is missing one major thing: a classic iPod to go with it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGh4pkF2WCmY3l5Jly55D9HUqUM=/0x0:5861x3907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540186/DSCF2292.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6Hwop"&gt;Earlier this year, I did something weird: I bought an iPod 5th generation, originally manufactured back in 2006. I got it mostly as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/22/17039896/ipod-diy-upgrade-battery-memory-hack"&gt;fun thing to mod&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve actually been using it on a near-daily basis. The experience has brought me to the conclusion that Apple should bring back the iPod, but updated for the modern age. It should keep the click-wheel of course, but I can’t stop thinking about how good an iPod, designed for the age of music streaming, AirPods, and high-res displays would be. I know that might sound silly, but let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jic8nB"&gt;There are a few reasons why Apple should make a new iPod. For one, it would allow the company to capitalize on some nostalgia for the iPod age that seems to be coming around, based on recent iPod-themed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548356/ipod-web-player-spotify-apple-music"&gt;web players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/28/20986886/iphone-app-ipod-classic-click-wheel-elvin-hu-developer"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/1/22260540/ipod-mod-portable-spotify-player-click-wheel-project"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgCPcV"&gt;The other, perhaps more obvious reason, is that the iPod is a music-centric device, and Apple literally has a service called Apple Music. The company is currently in love with services revenue, but many of its devices just aren’t that great at playing music. The iPhone makes it difficult to plug in many types of headphones, and Siri interrupts what you’re listening to when you’re asking it to do something simple that doesn’t really warrant an audible response (like turning on HomeKit-powered lights, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0FeZe"&gt;Most of, if not all, of Apple’s devices also can’t play the highest-end lossless files &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;that Apple Music can now deliver&lt;/a&gt; without additional hardware. This means that Apple doesn’t sell something it can point to and say “this is the best Apple Music experience you can get, period.” An iPod could be just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCZSDU"&gt;While Apple Music should be tightly integrated into a modern iPod, it would also be great if it could play music from other services, and if it had a totally Classic mode that just played files synced from a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqksbh"&gt;Not only would opening the iPod up avoid some terrible optics for a company that’s being scrutinized by the government and competitors (like Spotify) for abusing its role as a platform and service designer, but it would also help avoid some of the weirdness that comes with streaming music. A lot of the times I use my iPod these days are because Apple Music is acting up, forcing me to restart the app because it claims that content is unauthorized, or completely fritzing out when trying to play the lossless music Apple recently introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgVvWG"&gt;(Seriously, is anyone else having this problem? Randomly, but very often, the song I’m trying to listen to will devolve into a flurry of high-pitched, digital-sounding squeals, like I’m listening to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6tFRzt-QvA"&gt;a 100 Gecs song&lt;/a&gt; playing on a Discman that’s being vigorously shaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjgX2T"&gt;Of course, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipod-touch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F4%2F22561092%2Fapple-bring-back-ipods-2021-music-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still sell an iPod&lt;/a&gt;, after all these years: the iPod Touch. Now, don’t get me wrong, the iPod Touch is a very good device, especially for children, and people who just want a non-expensive iOS device. But that’s just the thing — the iPod Touch isn’t a purpose-driven music player, it’s an iPhone without the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGVBSl"&gt;But so what? That just means it can use its headphone jack to listen to tunes from Apple Music, as well as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Prime Music, and anything else, as well as play games, surf the web, read books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGdvcs"&gt;And that’s the rub for me: the iPod Touch is a good computing device, one that Apple should arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/28/18642381/apple-ipod-touch-update-iphone-7-processor"&gt;update more often&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes the best tool for a job isn’t the one that can do everything. It’s the one that’s designed to do one thing really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MjcC3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPod Touch is a good device, but sometimes the best tool isn’t the one that can do everything&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XS8dx"&gt;For example, when I’m listening to music on an iOS device I often find that I’m not actually &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; to the music, but scrolling through Twitter with it on in the background. That doesn’t happen with my 2006 iPod. The focus that comes with something that’s not offering you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU"&gt;everything, all of the time&lt;/a&gt;, is the same reason some people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444637/kobo-elipsa-e-reader-giant-screen-price-release-date-stylus"&gt;prefer e-readers&lt;/a&gt; over just reading on a tablet or phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3L4ka"&gt;And, practically speaking, making a dedicated portable music player without a smartphone OS and touchscreen would mean that Apple wasn’t competing as much with Android-powered players from the likes of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/audio-components/hi-res-audio/p/nwa105-b"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Resolution-Lossless-Bluetooth-Spotify/dp/B07L8P8QDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fiio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8iK0s"&gt;There’s also the matter of hardware — if Apple made a new iPod designed for just listening to music, it wouldn’t have to make it powerful enough to run 3D games or Safari, and could instead put resources to a better DAC and amp (perhaps one that could play Apple Music’s aforementioned 24 bit, 192 kHz lossless files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgxBsf"&gt;I don’t think that a new iPod would ever reach the dizzying heights of popularity that the older models did. Most people are perfectly content to listen to music on their phones — if they weren’t, Apple probably wouldn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16050420/apple-ipod-nano-shuffle-discontinued"&gt;stopped selling iPods&lt;/a&gt; in the first place. However, Apple’s a big company — it could stand to make a niche, music-focused device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434783/apple-homepod-stock-problems-discontinued-sale"&gt;even if its last one didn’t do so well&lt;/a&gt;. And as an old iPod enthusiast, it coming out with a new one would be literal music to my ears (I had to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USYUkK"&gt;P.S. — I’ve also found the Apple Music experience on the Apple Watch to be pretty mediocre, and I don’t want to take my phone on a run. I’m not saying there’s room for an iPod Shuffle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522993/apple-siri-on-device-speech-recognition-no-internet-wwdc"&gt;the new offline Siri&lt;/a&gt; instead of VoiceOver, but...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rVVusm"&gt;ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent company of video sharing app TikTok has started selling TikTok’s AI to other companies, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bed7cba1-db7a-49c7-9d57-06fd19e14e10"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports (may require subscription). The company has a new division called &lt;a href="https://www.byteplus.com/"&gt;BytePlus&lt;/a&gt;, and according to its website, its client list already includes US fashion app Goat, Singapore travel site WeGo, Indonesian shopping app Chilibeli, and India-based social gaming platform GamesApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hfsir"&gt;TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is a huge part of what has made it so popular. Essentially, the way you interact with the app affects what videos it will recommend to you. The company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; last year how its ForYou feed determines what videos to serve a given user. Its recommendations are based on user interactions including which videos you like, share comment on, or create; video information, such as captions and hashtags; and device and account settings including what device you’re using, your language preferences, and your location settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvKmZ3"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, BytePlus offers customers the chance to access the recommendation algorithm, and personalize it for their apps and customers. BytePlus also offers automated speech and text translation and real-time video effects as well as data analysis tools, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJgyyl"&gt;Over the past year and a half ByteDance and TikTok were among the China-based companies targeted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of executive orders from former President Trump, that sought to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;block China-based apps&lt;/a&gt; from US app stores. President Biden signed an executive order in June revoking the bans. Despite the pressure from the Trump administration, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html"&gt;TikTok surpassed 100 million monthly users&lt;/a&gt; in the US last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7GMtI"&gt;ByteDance didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
