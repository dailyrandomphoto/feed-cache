    <title>iOS 15 may give the iPhone’s camera an upgrade: fewer green flares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1EEmaRhJrnLZ3NJ4cvReKzmsJg=/0x199:2388x1791/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680500/IMG_2220.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtVSH9"&gt;The latest version of Apple’s iOS 15 beta seems to be making subtle improvements to photos by processing out the green lens flares that can show up in outdoor pictures (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). News of the feature was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted to the iOSBeta subreddit&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit user Doubleluckstur, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to see it in action by testing with an iPhone 12 Mini running the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xNJPR"&gt;Many iPhone users will be familiar with the green blobs, and while taking a picture it seems like nothing’s changed — the flare still shows up in the viewfinder. But when you go to view the final picture, the flare is nowhere to be seen (in some cases; we’ll get to that in a bit). It does seem to be the result of all the post-processing that’s done to the picture, as the flare shows up in the alternate (and less-processed) frames that are available if you’re using Apple’s Live Photo feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxjdgr8cE301KrCX9jJufRFYiWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762173/RPReplay_Final1628109977_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green dot shows up in the viewfinder and Live Photo, but not the processed still.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="AsRhIt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10686247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYq911"&gt;So far it’s a bit unclear which iPhone models the processing happens on. In the Reddit thread, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7mecjl?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;one user reports&lt;/a&gt; also seeing the green dot removal on their iPhone XS, while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7ohj3r?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;another says&lt;/a&gt; it doesn’t work on their iPhone 8 Plus. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; that the feature could be limited to phones with an A12 Bionic processor or newer (so the XS and XR onward). The feature only being available on newer phones wouldn’t necessarily be surprising: some of iOS 15’s features, like Live Text or Portrait mode for FaceTime, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;already have the A12 Bionic listed as a requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCaB9M"&gt;Of course, with this discovery came people trying to chase it down and find its limitations. Reddit user -DementedAvenger- &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7lopz8?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted examples of the flare still showing up&lt;/a&gt; on top of trees or mesh bug-proof window screens, as well as flares that came from a bathroom light instead of the sun. I was also able to replicate his tree example, as well as get some indoor flares of my own (though it’s worth noting that they’re not the same green bubble flares that so often occur from the sun).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hZxs_ku6WSu6_mljI9EFsGlbqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762112/IMG_2212.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still get flares if you’re really trying, especially indoors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgXtxl0S2tqx2T5xF7vvSu3o7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762119/IMG_2215.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the flare on the right side of the tree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xOvsrd"&gt;Another limitation is video: I couldn’t find any scenarios where flares showed up any differently in the final video than they did in the viewfinder. Of course, removing a lens flare from 30 or 60 frames per second 4K footage would be quite a bit more computationally intensive, and have a greater chance of looking a bit weird, so it’s not necessarily surprising that the feature seems to be photo-only for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GK_C-ZGCEC5do2EfQTAGN9UifT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762271/RPReplay_Final1628115178_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gif compression turns it white, but the flare is still clearly visible in this video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pNn8s7"&gt;As always with beta features, the functionality we’re seeing here could be different with the next release, or gone altogether. Still, it seems that Apple is at least experimenting with getting rid of the green blobs that can crop up in images from time to time, and it would be a welcome thing to see in the final version of iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook streamlines the settings page on mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeaYdozU55jXG8f3rO9Z0346mqc=/10x0:1398x925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680466/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.36.00_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old Facebook settings page compared to the new one on mobile.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5pmmN"&gt;Facebook is streamlining the settings page on mobile in &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;a new redesign&lt;/a&gt; that’s rolling out starting Wednesday. Visually, the new layout looks much less cluttered, and individual settings don’t have descriptions, meaning you’ll see more on the page at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ROKf"&gt;Facebook has also changed up the organization of the settings themselves. The company has reduced the number of categories for settings and renamed them, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, so now, you’ll see six categories of settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. Some settings have also been relocated so that they’re by related ones, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMPyON"&gt;You’ll be able to see the new look on Android, iOS, mobile web, and Facebook Lite. You might already have the redesign — I just checked the Facebook app on my iPhone 12 Mini and it loaded up. It was present on the mobile web for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Job alert: ‘Spaceport Mixologist’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWdvmKssy8krvMlsL_TsZbrgxhE=/0x44:921x658/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680227/Es7VmxuXEAASF3t.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Two since-destroyed Starship prototypes stand erect at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas Starship facilities. | Elon Musk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TKrWkf"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is seeking a “Spaceport Mixologist” who can whip up space-themed drinks next to the company’s sprawling rocket factory in south Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdZiaL"&gt;While space itself likely won’t be in their future, an experienced bartender — who will have one of the coolest job titles — will be tapped to join the hundreds of employees working on SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket system in rural Boca Chica, Texas. The mixologist will probably work out of the small house next to SpaceX’s budding spaceport that Musk calls the Starbase Tiki Bar and sling tiki drinks like the Test Pilot or Jet Pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoHyQA"&gt;“Experience pairing drinks with a themed menu” is on the list of preferred skills. “SpaceX has a number of food service outlets and formats serving our workforce and are looking to add many more. We are searching for candidates who have superior mixology experience with a focus in resorts, bars, and full service restaurants,” the &lt;a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/5417887002?gh_jid=5417887002"&gt;job description&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7FZX_9P9raomLH92Iochok7z6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762142/Ek4Pea_X0AAJC6b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of a drink at SpaceX’s tiki bar, according to Musk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QYlqGE"&gt;Also at SpaceX’s Boca Chica site is a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Erdayastronaut/status/1347973060943609856?s=20"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; and another bar in one of the company’s rocket-building towers that overlooks the whole spaceport. Musk calls that bar “High Bar” — in the “high bay” of the tower — and has described it as a “futuristic bar” with “360 degree windows &amp;amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory.” SpaceX &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TylerG1998/status/1408984275354013697?s=20"&gt;hosted a party&lt;/a&gt; at the High Bar in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BgsWkd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wHuoof"&gt;SpaceX is staffing dozens of food service jobs at locations in Texas and California to feed the company’s growing workforce. Cooks, baristas and sous chefs are among the open positions under the food services category of SpaceX’s jobs page. While SpaceX’s food establishments mainly serve its own employees, the public might not be left out for long. “I super support public spaces around our production &amp;amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347977322364694528?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in January. “When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp;amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gr4Aq"&gt;It’s not unusual for big tech and aerospace companies to employ chefs and baristas to serve their employees. From Facebook to Google to Boeing, they all have chefs and baristas, according to LinkedIn, and SpaceX has several chefs and baristas as well. But &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;hasn’t been able to find evidence of any in-house mixologists at other companies. One of Musk’s other companies, Neuralink, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421622513918955524?s=20"&gt;just built it’s own bar&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear whether the brain interface startup employs its own mixologist yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLucCb"&gt;SpaceX’s Boca Chica site is in its infancy, but it could one day send humans to the Moon — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;won a contract from NASA in April&lt;/a&gt; to launch the first US astronauts to the lunar surface since 1972. But before that moonshot happens, and probably before the tiki bar and restaurant open to the public, SpaceX has a ways to go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22352366/elon-musk-spacex-faa-warnings-starship-sn8-launch-violation-texas"&gt;‘maturing’ the more critical functions&lt;/a&gt; at Musk’s Starbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple places female engineering program manager on administrative leave after tweeting about sexism in the office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfOdMl213orTGUFd0OKn-9z4C_Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679863/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONzepy"&gt;Apple has placed senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik on indefinite administrative leave after she tweeted about sexism in the office. The company is currently investigating claims Gjøvik made about a hostile work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcaR7F"&gt;“For months, I have been raising concerns with Apple employee relations about years of experiences with sexism, a hostile work environment, sexual harassment, unsafe working conditions, and retaliation,” Gjøvik says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I asked them to mitigate the hostile work environment while they investigate, and they initially offered me EAP therapy and medical leave. I told them that made no sense, and said they should talk to my leadership and set up oversight and boundaries. I added that if there was no other option they could give me paid administrative leave. They apparently made no effort to set boundaries and instead said they were placing me on administrative leave and implied they did not want me on Slack where I had been vocal about my concerns with certain policies at the company. They also implied they didn’t want me to meet one-on-one with other women at the company about their concerns with Apple policies, which I had been doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYW22k"&gt;This afternoon, Gjøvik set an out of office message informing colleagues that the employee relations team had placed her on indefinite paid leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dpRzyx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, following raising concerns to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hostileworkenvironment?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#hostileworkenvironment&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unsafeworkconditions?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#unsafeworkconditions&lt;/a&gt;, I'm now on indefinite paid administrative leave per &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations, while they investigate my concerns. This seems to include me not using Apple's internal Slack.&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1423014977661591552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTXTo"&gt;This is the second time Apple has investigated Gjøvik’s claims about sex discrimination at the company. The employee relations team closed an earlier investigation, allegedly finding that nothing was wrong, prompting Gjøvik to tweet screenshots with what she says is just a small portion of what she experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4YgO7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wanted to share: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations confirmed this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tonepolicing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#tonepolicing&lt;/a&gt; is totally ok feedback for me to get from my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bigtech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bigtech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/male?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#male&lt;/a&gt; leaders &amp;amp; not &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexist?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As this investigation rolls on, I've decided to start Tweeting the stuff they say is "ok." I mean, they did say it was ok? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EImLTjRTBl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EImLTjRTBl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1422380335703101443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="yVcnq6"&gt;Apple is currently contending with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a wave of employee activism&lt;/a&gt;, including multiple women tweeting about their dissatisfaction with the company culture. In May, employees wrote a letter demanding an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez&lt;/a&gt;, who’d written a book about Silicon Valley with descriptions of women many people found offensive.  Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Playdate’s first season of games won’t hit every handheld at the same time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2B-kXc-6jJ_pGhWGuNVo3EU3fo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679840/Playdate_model_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ktTm2"&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;Panic’s Playdate&lt;/a&gt; — besides its lovely crank — is the unique game delivery method that will bring 24 free games to the device. Panic plans to release a season of games (Season One), two games at a time each week. &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/games/season/"&gt;In a new FAQ released on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Panic explains a bit more about how that’ll work and reveals that, due to limited manufacturing capacity, not everyone will be playing new games at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYcxYQ"&gt;All Playdates will download new games weekly on “New Game Day” as long they’re connected to Wi-Fi, starting with the first two games when you connect your device. The catch is that not everyone will connect their Playdate to the internet on day one due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587193/playdate-preorder-how-to-panic-teenage-engineering-handheld-console"&gt;limited preorders&lt;/a&gt;. That means rather than being in sync with the entire Playdate population (what Panic’s original “season of games” pitch implied), players will instead receive games in more or less the same cadence as the people in their preorder batch. Panic explains that this slight adjustment is due to what level of manufacturing and distribution is possible during the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xlGUGp"&gt;Our initial dream was a fully synchronized season for every owner, but that turned out to be really really hard to do with the reality of manufacturing (the factory can only make so many a week!) and distribution (international package delivery is only so reliable!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OZFI1h"&gt;If Panic does decide to do a Season Two of games,  it says it should be able to pull off its original plan since many people will already own Playdates. The company also makes it clear that even though the Playdate will automatically download games, you don’t have to be committed to them. You can delete and re-download games at any time if you need to make room on your device for other homemade titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfUTqk"&gt;You can see our impression of the Playdate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;in our hands-on here&lt;/a&gt; and a preview of what games Panic has lined up for Season One &lt;a href="https://play.date/"&gt;on its Playdate site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Flo Rida Roblox Amazon TikTok ad is fake but amazing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3q3Hl7JynqSdBbPkOcltMEnt-0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679707/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f35lYL"&gt;On Wednesday, a surreal TikTok ad from an advertiser posing as Amazon confused users into thinking the e-commerce giant was taking a stab at including absurdist internet humor into its online marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9EsHu"&gt;The ad featured gaming footage from the lego-like title &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;interspersed with strange clips of a man dancing to Flo Rida and T-Pain’s 2008 hit “Low,” but only the part where T-Pain says “Apple Bottom jeans.” There are also robot voices bullying each other about grandmas and girlfriends overlaid on the ad. The bizarre video was highlighted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eddyburback/status/1422972566629543941?s=20"&gt;Eddy Burback&lt;/a&gt;, a popular YouTuber and streamer, on his Twitter feed Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TCsgIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this was an amazon ad I got on tik tok???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is 100% real I just recorded it &lt;a href="https://t.co/cST0JoKb33"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cST0JoKb33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eddy Burback (@eddyburback) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eddyburback/status/1422972566629543941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OiWTsT"&gt;The ad purported to be purchased by the e-commerce giant Amazon, but Amazon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday that the ad was fake. Amazon said that it was investigating the issue with TikTok. TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUcmI8"&gt;It’s unclear how the fake ad made it onto the platform, but it appears to have been purchased by a third-party Amazon seller pretending to be the company itself. When you click the link attached to the ad, it brings you to an Amazon search results page for the key word “revealhome1.” The results include home decor and kitchen items like curtain ties and food jars. The ad could be an attempt to promote an Amazon referral code, and purchases made through the link would give the advertiser a cut of Amazon’s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJ4rSw"&gt;Last year, TikTok opened up its self-serve advertising platform to all advertisers, taking on other digital ad market competitors like Facebook and Google, &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/tiktoks-self-service-platform-launch-is-perfectly-timed-to-kick-facebook-while-its-down/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Digiday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While these self-service ad management services can create loads of revenue for companies like TikTok and Facebook, they’ve also been subject to fraud and &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/facebook-approved-ads-with-coronavirus-misinformation/"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtDmgq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NV0qlf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYT crossword puzzle no longer works in third-party apps, crosses puzzle solvers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a crossword puzzle being completed by a hand holding a pen. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Er_bTM3EJt1t4Uhc2_jPMAtKyQs=/169x0:4119x2633/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679665/834509654.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lA0MmX"&gt;People will no longer be able to play the digital version of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; daily crossword puzzle in third-party apps, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/crosswords/nyt-games-no-longer-available-on-across-lite-as-of-aug-9.html"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; made by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. Starting August 10th, the crossword will be available digitally only via the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; site or on its own crossword app. Downloadable PDFs, in addition to the physical newspaper, will still be available for people who want to print and play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpWDze"&gt;Until now, crosswords were available in the &lt;a href="http://www.word-buff.com/across-lite.html"&gt;Across Lite .puz file format&lt;/a&gt;, so anyone with a &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; games subscription could download a puzzle and open it in the desktop or mobile app of their choice. The change applies not just to future puzzles but to the archive of puzzles that are currently in the .puz format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTOYDK"&gt;Everdeen Mason, editorial director of games at the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EverdeenMason/status/1422548999018516482"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that she made the decision to end .puz support in an effort to build something where editors can “edit and make games rather than adapt things for tools we can’t control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="53XWKZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We also need to adapt to future technologies and build a foundation we can make more things on&lt;/p&gt;— EverQueen Mason (@EverdeenMason) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EverdeenMason/status/1422549001673584640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yNrGi6"&gt;Some crossword solvers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danfeyer/status/1422348847020351498"&gt;are peeved&lt;/a&gt; about the change. &lt;a href="https://www.xwordblog.com/2021/08/02/no-more-across-lite/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XWord Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a site for crossword enthusiasts, speed solvers and people who parse .puz files for puzzle analysis will likely be hit the hardest. Some people with low vision have mentioned that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ official crossword app doesn’t work well with screen readers, which will hopefully be addressed as third-party options disappear. &lt;/p&gt;

Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. Right now, for instance, you can get a new pair for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$197 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which include either a wired or wireless charging case. Although they normally retail for $160, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$160 at Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are a couple of deals going on right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-black%2F-%2FA-82026965&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are offering the Galaxy Buds Pro for $30 off, bringing the price down to $170.&lt;/p&gt;

A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus for $100 at places such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748159989908648779#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/3Pk6Pr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live are a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52C6bu"&gt;Right now, you can purchase a pair of the Galaxy Buds Live for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1577733-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r180nznaxar_galaxy_buds_live_noise_canceling.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748160308471290156#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, more than 10 percent off their initial MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i2Ah0B"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, but they haven’t been discounted yet given how recently they launched. Their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, however, remain an excellent pair of headphones that do routinely go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Typically $230, Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $168, one of the best prices we’ve seen on the earbuds outside of Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8F3h1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9wJvFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 38,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;Other true wireless earbuds deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. If you can live with those compromises, however, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for $180 — their second-best price to date — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740940140202691153" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-85t?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_campaign=100084481&amp;amp;cjevent=d1b5f6f7b81f11eb80a000a90a1c0e0c#/donotlink#100-99190700-98" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the current sale price on the Elite 85t is still intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. We consider the Jabra 75t — on sale in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B082Y256ZV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$113 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744674062317456142#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; may be the latest fitness earbuds from Apple, but if you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available right now for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at Walmart, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPowerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones-with-Apple-H1-Headphone-Chip-Ivory%2F869400130%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPowerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones-with-Apple-H1-Headphone-Chip-Black%2F587866546%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black models&lt;/a&gt; for $179 and $190, respectively. Walmart offers a slew of other discounted colorways, as do &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744674259269836975#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTR418/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, but most hover around $200, which is notably higher than some of the more recent sale prices we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;Much like their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; represent a tremendous value. Amazon’s latest true wireless earbuds offer improved comfort and better noise cancellation, along with a terrific passthrough mode that ensures you can always hear what’s going on around you. They also feature hands-free Alexa support and sound that’s remarkably satisfying, with more bass than AirPods Pro and an appropriate amount of restraint when it comes to the high end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhZp6r"&gt;Although they normally retail for $120, the white model is now &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fecho-buds-2nd-gen-wireless-earbuds-glacier-white%2F-%2FA-82819990%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Target for $90&lt;/a&gt;, a cool 25 percent off Amazon’s typical retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PgPi8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="de2M6w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Peloton is updating its treadmills to again be useful without a subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyU_LBGt0vL_aAlBBglCI2YXAAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679388/akrales_190328_3240_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3wIGPL"&gt;Peloton owners will again be able to use their treadmills without a subscription to the Peloton All-Access Membership, according to the company. In June, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545663/peloton-tread-plus-treadmill-subscription-plan-recall"&gt;released a software update&lt;/a&gt; that required its treadmills to be secured with a passcode, a feature the company said was only available to paying subscribers due to “technical limitations.” At the time, Peloton promised that another software update was coming that would enable the feature for everyone, and it provided three free months of the subscription that usually costs $40 per month. On Wednesday, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “all Tread owners can now access Tread Lock” along with the “Just Run” feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vh9rhV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060884531-Tread-Lock"&gt;Peloton’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, the Tread Lock feature locks the treadmill if you’re not in a class and haven’t used the treadmill in 45 seconds. You’ll then be required to put in your four-digit passcode before it can be used. The aforementioned June software update made using the feature mandatory, after Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalled its treadmills&lt;/a&gt; following several reported injuries and one death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CgTy6B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company seems to have bought itself enough time to work around the “technical limitations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8k30xx"&gt;The Tread Lock requirement essentially made the treadmills unusable without a subscription. While Peloton may be best known for its classes (which require a paid membership), the Tread Plus’ Just Run mode allowed owners to use it as a normal treadmill, no subscription required. But because Tread Lock became mandatory and using Tread Lock required a subscription, Just Run was no longer available to owners who weren’t subscribers. The company did, however, provide all owners with three free months of membership after the change, which seems to have given it enough time to make the treadmills usable again without paying the monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7PV1u"&gt;The update that created this situation served as a reminder that internet-connected devices can have their functionality changed — just because a feature was present at launch doesn’t mean it will stick around for the lifetime of the product. This case was, however, especially painful for users, as it made a subscription that was optional at the time of purchase a mandatory one (if only for a short time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ftPdqJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Internet-connected devices are always subject to change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gWs1vj"&gt;Because of the recall issued by Peloton, Tread Plus owners are eligible for a full refund if they choose to return their treadmills by November 6th, 2022, &lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/peloton-recalls-tread-plus-treadmills-after-one-child-died-and-more-than-70-incidents"&gt;according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt;. Those who choose to keep their Pelotons, though, should again have the choice to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is testing a Snapchat-style stories feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jQPcejj7efOkQi9qpOxk77NbpqU=/0x44:1230x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679298/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_3.30.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422994358400389123" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Navara / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DOSnVJ"&gt;On a long enough timeline, every social media app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;trends to adding stories&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s apparently TikTok’s turn: the popular video app is experimenting with a new stories feature. The feature was highlighted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422994358400389123"&gt;Matt Navarra on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and a TikTok spokesperson confirmed the test in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkEGVg"&gt;The new feature, simply called “TikTok Stories,” appears to work similarly to other stories functions on apps like Instagram or Snapchat. Stories live in a newly added slide-over sidebar, where you’ll be able to see stories posted by accounts that you follow on TikTok for 24 hours before they’re automatically deleted. Other users will be able to react and comment on your story, too. And just like on Instagram and other platforms, you’ll also be able to tap on a user’s profile picture to load a story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWfifZ"&gt;TikTok describes the feature in the app as “a new way to interact with your fans.” Users can create a new story by tapping a “create” button that’s been added to the sidebar, and they can add the usual captions, music, and text. True to TikTok’s video-first nature, it seems stories have to be videos, not still images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="or2iV1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="da" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing TikTok Stories ✨ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plot twist!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;h/t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amanfirdaus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@amanfirdaus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gvQMzixYtS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gvQMzixYtS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422994358400389123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="raGn1q"&gt;“We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson wrote in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Currently we’re experimenting with ways to give creators additional formats to bring their creative ideas to life for the TikTok community.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ws6DqP"&gt;The company didn’t provide any details on how extensively it’s testing TikTok Stories, nor when (or even if) it’ll see a wider release. However, a quick search on Twitter reveals a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InahEvans/status/1422675950471245824"&gt;number of TikTok users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/beaupcy/status/1422795441083543557"&gt;who have already gotten access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SabriKolod/status/1422996011803365380/photo/2"&gt;to the feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuajvM"&gt;The fact that TikTok would experiment with stories isn’t surprising. Stories have been one of the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/will-now-have-stories"&gt;only true constants&lt;/a&gt; in social media, with platforms from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15081398/facebook-stories-snapchat-camera-direct"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22249152/pinterest-story-pins-carousel-home-screen-update"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/19/17255966/netflix-30-second-video-previews-mobile"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18117670/youtube-stories-creators-subscribers-instagram-philip-defranco"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537243/microsoft-xbox-app-stories-feature"&gt;Xbox app&lt;/a&gt; replicating &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/3/4791934/snapchats-next-big-thing-stories-that-dont-just-disappear"&gt;Snapchat’s original feature&lt;/a&gt; from 2013. When they work, stories are a great way to get users to interact with each other on an app, offer a new place for ads, and generally keep the feedback loop of a social media app in motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWqTRg"&gt;Stories aren’t always successful, however: just ask Twitter, which was forced to shutter its own stories clone — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;the creatively named Fleets&lt;/a&gt; — earlier this week, just eight months after it launched them, due to a general apathy toward the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
