    <title>Treasury to issue new cryptocurrency sanctions after ransomware attacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hacker (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uf6k-WUl4lBZEQW9RTzILouUvSI=/3x0:1097x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873608/hacker-stock1_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvFJjf"&gt;The Biden administration is preparing to issue a series of actions, including sanctions, to make it more difficult for hackers to profit off of ransomware attacks through the use of digital currency, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-target-crypto-ransomware-payments-with-sanctions-11631885336"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GjmPp"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the Treasury Department plans to impose these new sanctions as soon as next week. The sanctions would reportedly target specific traders and cryptocurrency exchanges, in the hope of deterring exchanges from processing these transactions when they’re made. The department will also issue new guidance for businesses regarding the risks they take on by complying with ransomware payment requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXyz7B"&gt;The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TALV0w"&gt;These proposed measures would be the Biden administration’s most significant move to address the wave of ransomware attacks that have only grown in scale and frequency over the last year. In May, one of the largest US pipelines, Colonial Pipeline, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;was taken offline&lt;/a&gt; after a ransomware attack. The company paid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;more than $4 million&lt;/a&gt; in ransom to the attackers in order to bring the pipeline back online. Earlier this month, Howard University closed after a ransomware attack interrupted the school’s computer and technology services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQH4Ug"&gt;In May, President &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; making it easier for government and private sector businesses to share information in the wake of cyberattacks. The order also required government agencies to deploy multi-factor authentication services in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goQKCR"&gt;The Biden administration is expected to issue new anti-money laundering and terror finance rules later this year to restrict the use of cryptocurrency for payments in ransomware attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2m4Yzi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33Zy4N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell Latitude 9420 review: pricey performance</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A dream for workers and IT departments alike&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="z9M093"&gt;Dell’s Latitude line is the answer to Lenovo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad business notebooks&lt;/a&gt;, some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market. Latitudes aren’t much to look at, but they come packed with security features. There’s a proximity sensor that automatically locks and unlocks the screen. There’s a physical webcam shutter that moves on its own. There’s the Dell Optimizer program which (in theory) learns your behavior over time and tailors everything from audio quality to charging speed accordingly. Most significantly, the Latitude line supports Intel’s vPro, a hardware and firmware platform that includes a number of security features and makes it easier for IT departments to manage devices remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAl8ml"&gt;The Latitude 9420 replaces last year’s Latitude 9410, and the two products look pretty darn similar with a thin, light, CNC-aluminum build. But with the combination of vPro and Intel’s prestigious Evo standards, the 9420 offers a compelling package for business users who are willing to pay a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHDnHoLiZJiISNrACqGquMRyHT8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771148/mchin_210802_4692_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell says the Latitude is “leading the new age of intelligence.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="gmW5J6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10689760"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BZd85N"&gt;The first thing to emphasize about the 9420 is that it’s not at all cheap. The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/2-in-1-laptops-tablets/latitude-9420-2-in-1-or-laptop-build-your-own/spd/latitude-14-9420-2-in-1-laptop/ctol942014us" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base model&lt;/a&gt; starts at $2,039 and includes a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 14-inch 1920 x 1200 screen. (Since these are business laptops, companies often buy them in bulk for lower prices.) I tested a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-9420-2-in-1-or-laptop-build-your-own/spd/latitude-14-9420-2-in-1-laptop/ctol942014us?configurationid=f22f6c0b-6032-4d15-ab34-2e46c2615c5b" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more expensive 2-in-1 model&lt;/a&gt; listed at $2,926.75 that includes a Core i7-1185G7, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and a 2560 x 1600 touch display. You can go all the way up to a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/2-in-1-laptops-tablets/latitude-9420-2-in-1-or-laptop/spd/latitude-14-9420-2-in-1-laptop/maxl942014us" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$3,309 model&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor and screen but 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3efnGF"&gt;But if money’s no object for you or your company, the Latitude offers a suite of benefits — particularly for folks who work on remote teams. New to this Latitude model is the SafeShutter, an automated physical camera cover. It covers the webcam whenever you’re not using it, and disappears when you pull up Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or anything else that needs to access the camera. This worked very well and should be convenient for folks who are in and out of virtual meetings all day. (There’s also a physical on / off switch on the keyboard.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrH4sx"&gt;The camera itself — a 3.5mm shooter that supports Windows Hello — is actually good, delivering one of the best pictures I’ve ever seen from a laptop’s webcam. The speakers (two upward-firing and two downward-firing) deliver average volume but clear audio with booming bass and percussion. The four microphones had no trouble picking up my voice, and they succeeded in making me audible above my loud typing and some assorted background noise. Dell also says that Optimizer will direct your bandwidth to videoconferencing applications while they’re in use. It’s a good package for meetings overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Dell Latitude 9420." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ps702wVyzHxZXE-3GV6RMypvUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771149/mchin_210802_4692_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can plug in a webcam or other peripherals with the two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z9Ahu"&gt;Another highlight is the 16:10 aspect ratio, which gives the QHD screen extra vertical space. Less scrolling than a typical 16:9 screen, more room for tabs and apps — all good things. You can configure the 9420 with 5G or 4G, and Dell says that Optimizer automatically finds the strongest Wi-Fi access points. And you get a fine port selection, including an HDMI 2.0, two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 4, a uSD4.0 memory card reader, a combination audio jack, a wedge lock slot, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 on a wooden table, open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays a blue desktop background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E--nvgqG7FLWMbzmQGOWb6g-FsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771147/mchin_210802_4692_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;91.6 percent screen-to-body ratio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="og3qb6"&gt;The only real issue I ran into was with the trackpad. It was unresponsive compared to most laptop trackpads — I felt like I was coaxing the cursor along at times, and it didn’t always go quite where I wanted it to. The device sometimes thought I was clicking when I wasn’t clicking, resulting in accidentally closing windows or leaving my active screen all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1U8FWR"&gt;I told Dell about this, and the complaint was, refreshingly, well-taken. The company first sent me a replacement unit, which had the same issues. It then told me its engineers had figured out the problem with the first two units and fixed it. I was then sent a third unit, on which the trackpad worked just fine. Thanks, Dell! Let’s hope that issue is gone for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUy8Yy"&gt;Dell says customers who got a unit with a finnicky touchpad should contact the company’s tech support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 open on a wooden porch table. The screen displays a blue desktop background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7t_wRVOCUXPDIg_h-LIowLJ7Zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771151/mchin_210802_4692_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touchpad is larger than those of previous generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BtJVhX"&gt;The biggest upgrade over previous Latitudes comes on the inside. Dell claims that the new 11th Gen vPro processors deliver 66 percent more CPU power than their 10th Gen counterparts did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb4zT3"&gt;The 9420 is something of a milestone for the business laptop market — it’s the first vPro device to also be verified through Intel’s Evo program, which certifies that a device meets Intel’s various requirements to be a top competitor in the consumer space including instant wake, fast charging, and responsive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6COWJ"&gt;Dell and Intel are pushing this combination as a way to please IT departments while also competing with the best consumer laptops on performance, battery life, and other standard productivity metrics. “We’re used to mobile devices that project a certain confidence, style, status, that’s an important part of what Evo also brings,” Intel VP and GM of mobile innovation Josh Newman told me in an interview. “vPro, it’s the performance and security that IT wants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFx9Dt"&gt;That’s especially important as remote and hybrid work blurs the line between business and personal laptops for some customers. “This environment that we’re all living in, it’s so hybrid. You really, from an IT perspective, cannot predict where your end users are going to be, and so security becomes really important, and that’s where vPro comes into play,” added Meghana Patwardhan, Dell’s VP and GM of mainstream commercial PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="PFnBX3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10689768"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="EDK8so"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I didn’t experience any lag or sluggishness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dp5UX3"&gt;When it came to the tasks that many business laptops are most often used for these days — videoconferencing, word processing, photo editing, research, and other tasks in Chrome — the Latitude performed quite well. I didn’t experience any lag or sluggishness, even when I was doing photo work on top of a dozen Chrome tabs with Spotify streaming. The fans did sometimes get quite loud, though you can switch to a Quiet cooling profile in Dell’s Power Manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Latitude 9420 facing away from the camera, angled slightly to the left, on a porch table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tf925VnDgN6ZSr7xAL9YMJpF68U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771153/mchin_210802_4692_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not quite a gaming PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU7VjO"&gt;For more intense workloads, the Latitude is a solid contender. The 9420 took eight minutes and 16 seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in Adobe Premiere Pro. That beats last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Latitude 9510&lt;/a&gt;, with a 10th Gen vPro Core i7, which took just over 28 minutes. That’s quite a delta. For a more modern comparison, both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; (both with a Core i7-1165G7) took over 10 minutes to complete the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61Dz7P"&gt;Updates to Premiere Pro can impact export time, so a better apples-to-apples comparison is the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/"&gt;Puget Systems benchmark for Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which tests live playback and export performance at both 4K and 8K. The Latitude scored a 261, which also beats the most recent &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=16041"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=50457"&gt;XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. (These results are mostly for the sake of performance comparison — the Latitude wouldn’t be the best choice for anyone regularly working with 4K and 8K video.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymgJzD"&gt;While the 9420 wouldn’t be recommended as a primary gaming device, some gaming is certainly possible. Despite its business focus, the laptop beat some of the best consumer thin and light laptops on a few titles. It averaged 55fps on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s Ultra settings at native resolution and 58fps at 1920 x 1200, where the XPS 13 averaged 48fps. We saw 22fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at native resolution and 35fps at 1920 x 1200, which also beats the XPS. (This was on the title’s lowest possible settings, of course, so it wouldn’t be the most fun to play on this machine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iip13N"&gt;The Latitude did not do as well on lighter titles. It averaged 95fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s maximum settings and 157fps on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, which are both worse than what we saw from the XPS 13. The Latitude also lost to the XPS 13 2-in-1, which performed slightly better than its clamshell counterpart in our testing, on every title here. That device averaged a whopping 226fps on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends. &lt;/em&gt;(Of course, you’ll only see a maximum of 60fps from any of these devices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh0RST"&gt;It’s interesting that the Latitude is beating these consumer laptops in Premiere Pro tasks, but losing in other graphic benchmarks. I’ve asked Dell if it has any insight here and will update this review if we make any headway, but my guess is that Dell’s software is better optimized for production workloads than it is for games (which makes sense for a business laptop). My other takeaway here is that even where the Latitude is outperforming the best consumer laptops, it’s not by a ton — which emphasizes how much extra you’re paying for vPro and the Latitude’s business features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="O9SZDl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10689775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i7WODS"&gt;Cooling was a mixed bag. During both Premiere Pro tests, the CPU spent a worrying amount of time around 99 degrees Celsius. It was much better controlled during gaming, staying between the mid 60s and high 70s. That does indicate that the Latitude may be hitting a cooling wall when it comes to video work. (The keyboard and palm rests did remain comfortable, on the plus side.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UcT2v"&gt;Finally, battery life has been a strength of Latitudes in the past but was a mixed bag here. The device averaged five hours and 41 minutes of continuous use (at around 200 nits of brightness). But the stamina seemed to be heavily influenced by certain settings. When I ran a trial on the Better Performance Windows profile, I got under two hours of juice. I averaged over 10 hours when I ran trials on the Windows Battery Saver profile and Dell’s Quiet cooling profile with Dell’s Battery Extender on, Intel’s power savings on, and the AI features in Dell Optimizer (including the proximity sensor) off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdgcOI"&gt;Dell thinks that battery life was a fluke — on a replacement unit, I saw a better average of around seven hours. That’s still not close to the exceptional results we’ve seen from previous Latitudes, but it’s much closer to what we expect from laptops at this price point. I’d still recommend switching on all the battery-saving stuff whenever you need an all-day lifespan, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Tv9a7"&gt;I have very few complaints about this Latitude. Even things I usually complain about on laptops — the webcam and the audio — were pretty good here. The 9420 is a solid ThinkPad competitor, and easily one of the best business convertibles you can buy. It can accommodate photo and video work, and it can even run lighter games on the side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SI4sEk"&gt;But, of course, there’s the price. Even the base model’s price tag will be out of reach for many people. And if you’re a freelancer or small-business worker, or you’re just looking for a personal device, you can get the same build quality, a 16:10 touchscreen, and performance that’s fairly similar (and even better if you’re gaming) from the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-2-in-1-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-2-in-1-laptop/x27310ekpts#customization-anchor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over $1,000 cheaper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WdmNMx"&gt;As Dell’s and Intel’s representatives have noted, this laptop is really for folks who need both the vPro platform and the Evo platform — the best business features and the best consumer features in one product. If you are in that group, the Latitude 9420 is a solid package that asks very few compromises. It’s premium technology for a premium price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WH9qsj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tT4E8z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 3:11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added trackpad observations and battery life results from a third replacement unit. Updated the score to an 8.5 in light of the better performing trackpad. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s seven-minute tour shows off what’s new in the iPhone 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAZdcCDnKArVTjMvX8yLXTCnTqw=/237x0:2643x1604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873250/Screen_Shot_2021_09_17_at_10.36.28_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KmGBoC"&gt;Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72cAe_2LAFQ"&gt;a seven-and-a-half-minute video&lt;/a&gt; to act as a guided tour of the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro’s features, and to make the differences in the lineup clearer. In the clip, Apple also goes through some of the phone’s new video and camera features like cinematic mode, photographic styles, and macro photography, and emphasizes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;the phones’ increased battery life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqaxXR"&gt;The video doesn’t really give us any new info, but it does give us more (obviously very carefully crafted) footage of the iPhone 13 outside of a blank black or white background.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcZ_XzHyPV5dqo1n_h3cEjgzt1A=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873052/Apple_iphone13_display_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="evzXav"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup&lt;/a&gt; comes with the biggest change Apple has made to the front of its iPhones since it first introduced Face ID with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review"&gt;iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;: that controversial notch has finally been shrunken down a bit. Apple says the new notch is about 20 percent smaller than the old one, although eagle-eyed observers have noticed it comes with the tradeoff of being a hair taller, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDtY9x"&gt;The new and improved notch is still a notch. A big notch, too, compared to the hole-punch cameras and teardrop cutouts that competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;like Samsung&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; have been offering on their flagship phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyF7Oh"&gt;Naturally, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have some thoughts on the subject: is the notch worth it in 2021? Or does it need to go the way of the dinosaur?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DHmSDR"&gt;
&lt;p id="egbcNs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve been using a notched iPhone since the iPhone X first launched, and I’m a notch apologist at this point. Compared to the bezel-heavy style that preceded it, it’s an obvious improvement; it’s hard to go back to the older iPhone SE style. And while a lot of Face ID-based features have turned out to be pretty gimmicky (looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16735822/animoji-karaoke-tutorial-iphone-x"&gt;Memoji and Animoji&lt;/a&gt;), the core functionality here is still really, really great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjhd3o"&gt;When it comes to unlocking a phone, Face ID just works, and it works well. And that’s largely because it does need all the tech that Apple fits in (including the various sensors, IR emitters, and the actual front-facing camera.) True, Android phones don’t have notches like the iPhone, but they also don’t have facial unlock systems that work nearly as well. And if a notch is the price to pay for convenience, it’s one I can accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYzWH0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean Hollister: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, I admit Face ID is fantastic. It was the single greatest thing about switching from Android for me. I couldn’t believe how easy it was to log into my bank, check my medical records, or access and copy/paste my password manager’s passwords when I made an iPhone 12 Mini my daily driver last year. But that’s just as much a jab at Android as it is praise for the iPhone — because what I love is &lt;em&gt;speed&lt;/em&gt;, which has nothing to do with my face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bUtXY5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Speed has nothing to do with my face&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pcCm8"&gt;Why hasn’t Android standardized on an excellent, fast fingerprint sensor, one placed precisely where I leave my digits anyhow? Why did Apple always insist on fitting it into the bottom bezel of its phones where I’d have to awkwardly stretch down? Why not mount a fingerprint-reading camera in that iPhone logo Apple always loves to leave on the back of its phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaXHjl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: A rear fingerprint reader would mess with Apple’s easily shattered lovely looking slab of glass on the back, though. If the company can nail an under-glass fingerprint reader, they’re better off just sticking one on the front of the phone under the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yWEGO"&gt;The one thing I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; see an argument for is bringing back Touch ID, integrated into the power button (like on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the recent iPad Air.) But even if you were to do that, Apple would still have to find somewhere to put the front-facing camera. Hiding it away in the bezels won’t work on an iPhone; there’s just simply nowhere to put it. And choosing between a small notch with less functionality and a marginally larger one with more, Face ID is an easy choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini, with Touch ID.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G7Lcr6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;They could put it where everyone else puts it these days: a tiny hole instead of a giant notch. Or how about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;those under-display selfie cameras&lt;/a&gt; we’ve heard so much about? Speaking of which, what keeps Apple from giving us an under-display fingerprint sensor, or sticking the guts of Face ID into the hole in a hole-punch display, too? I’m not saying the notch bugs me every single time I look at the screen (OLED works wonders), but surely you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a notch just to fit a couple of fancy IR blasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEfHpg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now it sounds like under-display cameras are still a bit more trouble then they’re worth; assuming Apple gets on board with that, it’d imagine it’ll still be some time before the tech catches up to the idea of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urqYJH"&gt;But even if they were, there’s a lot more to Face ID than just a couple of fancy IR blasters. Remember this slide from when Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16288806/apple-iphone-x-price-release-date-features-announced"&gt;announced the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S569GXo7aLn-mHvKIdf_Gxq4JRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9230639/apple_iphone_2017_20170912_11726.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s inside the iPhone’s notch, circa iPhone X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OZw3Z"&gt;That seems like it’d be more difficult to cram into a hole punch cutout — even if Apple was willing to go with a larger one, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ double-camera cutout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm3AMN"&gt;Of course, the biggest argument in favor of bringing a fingerprint reader back is the stark reality of 2020 and 2021: the fact that we’re all wearing masks all the time, and that Face ID, frankly, is terrible when you’re wearing a mask. But hopefully that issue will improve if (when?) the pandemic starts to ebb, and I can go back to easily unlocking my phone when I’m out and about again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjmFnE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;Hey! I was saving that argument for later. Cutting me off at the pass is a dirty trick. So do you agree that speed matters more than the fact that Face ID uses your face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yy2nuA"&gt;Okay, let’s pretend for a moment that Face ID actually requires a linear array of components (even though the speaker, microphone, ambient light sensor and proximity sensor in that image all feature in standard phones and almost all of them could easily be placed on a phone’s rim). What’s so wrong about giving a phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;a little bit of forehead&lt;/a&gt; instead of a notch, like the Pixel 4’s Face ID competitor? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BLIvC7sjrH7T4cLd3x1x_ZujPOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19302260/vpavic_191016_3730_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 4 stuck its sensors inside its forehead instead of a notch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RjrFbf"&gt;Stick some extra battery underneath the additional height that change would afford — or hell, how about a good ol’ headphone jack. Design certainly isn’t the reason that particular Pixel failed; it was panned for lackluster battery life and gimmicks, and probably didn’t have anywhere near &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;enough marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cSc6d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean, design may have had something to do with it, but the Pixel 4 helps prove my point: Google was cramming way more tech than even Face ID had for the sake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/30/21496318/google-soli-radar-motion-sense-rick-osterloh-pixel-5"&gt;gimmicky Soli gestures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="letRMx"&gt;And taking up the whole top of the phone for a camera array feels like a worse situation than the notch; at least with the notch, you can still nominally use the top area of the phone as a status bar thanks to the “rabbit ears” of screens on the side (something that previous versions of iOS had to devote useful pixel space for.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Llo3e"&gt;There’s also the chance that Apple could one day add Touch ID back to the iPhone, either in button or in-display form. But even if it does, it’s hard for me to imagine the company backtracking from Face ID at this point. Which means that like it or not, Sean, you’ll probably have to suffer a notch for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HGlMWK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;I guess I kinda like the rabbit ears. But suffer, I will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pXeN7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRANRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwqbhc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KACKtl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKICbv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejbLCS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoxaZ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is getting an Among Us clone from Zynga</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_b3LqY27X9ekLxGd8W_jJ3RW2g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873024/revamp_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zynga&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1H40Sq"&gt;Zynga is bringing a social deception game called &lt;em&gt;ReVamp&lt;/em&gt; to Snapchat’s games platform “soon,” &lt;a href="https://www.zynga.com/corporate/zynga-announces-revamp-the-first-multiplayer-social-deception-game-for-snapchat/"&gt;the developer announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;ReVamp&lt;/em&gt;, clearly inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;the popularity of games like &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;is a real-time multiplayer game where players try to find the vampire among... them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6j0oyB"&gt;Players in &lt;em&gt;ReVamp&lt;/em&gt; “aim to reveal who the vampire player is among their group of friends while they renovate the rooms of an old mansion,” Zynga’s description says. The game also features the frequently contentious voting round, where players decide to remove people they suspect are imposters, except with &lt;em&gt;ReVamp&lt;/em&gt; they’re finding a vampire in a group of humans, as opposed to an alien &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/9/15/22676173/among-us-official-costume-impostor-crewmate"&gt;in a group of “spacebeans.”&lt;/a&gt; This is only the third game Zynga has released for Snap Games, but given the viral success of &lt;em&gt;Among Us,&lt;/em&gt; it seems poised to be popular on Snap’s growing games platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CplUoM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLw0-0wIdfE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6HPic1"&gt;Snap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525168/snapchat-games-bitmoji-party-developers"&gt;first introduced Snap Games&lt;/a&gt; to its Snapchat app (a lot of snaps I know) in 2019, a month or so after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293913/bitmoji-party-snap-games-original-multiplayer-mobile"&gt;it launched &lt;em&gt;Bitmoji&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Party&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The company has introduced other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22170223/snapchat-bitmoji-paint-game-party-release-talk-friends"&gt;interesting multiplayer games&lt;/a&gt; since, and partnered with other developers. The experiment seems successful so far: Snapchat has reached over 200 million players with its games and mini-apps, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/20/snapchat-games-have-reached-more-than-200-million-people/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt;, and 30 million players play Snap Games every month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmWBnw"&gt;That’s not as many as the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1258079550321446912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1258079550321446912%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fhow-many-people-play-fortnite%2F"&gt;350 million registered &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players Epic claimed in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s still nothing to sneeze at. Plus if Snap can get more of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22589236/snapchat-users-293-million-q2-2021"&gt;the now 293 million people that use its app daily&lt;/a&gt;, it could quickly change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook tells Apple employees he’s ‘looking forward to moving forward’ after Epic ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iq80HEV7RCR4gvDyHj2oHqRVItE=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873004/1233030828.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ipmKjv"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that he was “looking forward to moving forward” after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;a verdict in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust case&lt;/a&gt;. In an all-hands meeting with employees, Cook echoed the line Apple has taken publicly on the case, celebrating the company’s legal wins and downplaying its loss on an unfair competition claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngNyVt"&gt;“If you sort of back up and remember what the App Store is about, the App Store was built to be a trusted place for users so they could go explore and discover apps. It was meant to be a great business opportunity for developers,” Cook told employees, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Epic came along and wanted basically to be handled in a special way. Our rules are that we treat everyone the same. They ask us repeatedly to treat them different, we said no, and they sued us on 10 different items. The court ruled nine of those in favor of Apple and one in favor of Epic. Most importantly, they ruled that Apple is not a monopoly, which we’ve always known. Apple is in a fiercely competitive market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CR0Kgk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2SQ7Fw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21396313/apple-fortnite-lawsuit-emails-app-store-ban-epic"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney asked Apple&lt;/a&gt; last year to let it include alternate payment methods in its iOS version of the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. However, Sweeney said that Epic “hope[d] that Apple will also make these options equally available to all iOS developers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5yp2C"&gt;Contrary to Cook’s statement that “we treat everyone the same,” Apple has provided special treatment to a variety of app developers in the past. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;It offered Netflix a special deal&lt;/a&gt; where it took just a 15 percent cut of subscriptions sold inside the app, and weighed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;offering special perks to Netflix&lt;/a&gt; if the streaming video company would maintain support for in-app purchases. The company also carved out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;categories of apps&lt;/a&gt; that can bypass its commission for in-app purchases, and blocked or decided not to feature apps it seemingly feared might compete. You can see examples of special treatment for particular developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;in our collection of unearthed emails&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSMwHo"&gt;Cook is correct, however, that a California judge ruled Apple didn’t have a monopoly in digital gaming transactions — the relevant market in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;. The company successfully avoided Epic’s demands that it open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloaded apps, and the court said Apple was justified in collecting a commission on digital goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyR1Wk"&gt;Cook didn’t confirm whether Apple planned to appeal its one loss: the verdict that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431356/epic-v-apple-anti-steering-ios-fortnite-subscriptions-web-day-7"&gt;Apple’s anti-steering rules&lt;/a&gt; (which restrict developers from telling users about alternate payment options) violate California’s Unfair Competition Law. The ruling orders Apple to abandon the rules by December. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;Epic has indicated&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to appeal its own losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcz7gj"&gt;But like Apple spokespeople &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;have done publicly&lt;/a&gt;, Cook suggested he wasn’t overly worried. “I think the ruling will be very good to try to put some of the discussions to rest on the App Store. In terms of the one we lost, there were one or two sentences scratched out of an agreement, that was the extent of it. I’m sort of looking forward to moving forward now,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new COVID-19 policy requires vaccinations to skip ‘frequent’ testing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Requires Masks Be Worn At Most Stores After New CDC Recommendations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-eOaaDHh2M9uJIarcvYnMFdl4Bs=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872984/1331332668.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fu5aS6"&gt;Starting next month, Apple will “infrequently” test employees who come into its offices and stores for COVID-19, if they’re vaccinated. Unvaccinated employees will have to get frequent testing. Apple CEO Tim Cook and senior vice president of retail and people Deirdre O’Brien announced the new policy during an all-hands meeting today, according to an audio recording obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79oLQu"&gt;The company’s updated guidelines appear to line up with the OSHA standards that will be established as a result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666508/biden-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;the Biden administration’s push to increase vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. Those standards say companies of 100 people or more must require either immunization or weekly testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG6Fmv"&gt;Apple recently pushed back the date when it expects employees to return to its office in response to a surge of cases and the Delta variant. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;internal email in August&lt;/a&gt; specified that the mandatory return is delayed until at least January 2022, and employees can expect a one-month notice ahead of time before it goes into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PaD0S"&gt;During the meeting, Cook told employees that “we need to learn” about a hybrid workplace after years of being entirely in the office and the last 18 months or so at home. For now, Apple will give everyone in the company three extra days off next quarter. For employees in the US, those days will come the week of Thanksgiving, while teams in other countries will set their dates independently.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s exactly how much bigger the iPhone 13 batteries are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_H_cxPwPw1U4RLD0hhlomI-9P8=/434x314:2357x1596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872865/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_5.35.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y76x0s"&gt;We’ve just gotten our first look at the iPhone 13s’ battery sizes, thanks to a product information sheet &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fmore-resources%2Fgtc.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;posted on Apple’s behalf&lt;/a&gt; to hazardous material information and response company &lt;a href="https://app.clickdimensions.com/blob/chemtreccom-aczvc/files/apis_bpisreportupdated20210916.pdf?1631813744835"&gt;Chemtrec’s website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/16/iphone-13-battery-life/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The document shows that the batteries in iPhones have gotten significantly bigger since last year — 13 percent larger, on average — and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is getting comparable to devices like the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNcqjd"&gt;In the document, battery sizes are reported in watt-hours instead of the more traditional milliamp hours. Even though most phone manufacturers give battery sizes in milliamp hours, they’re often &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/watts-in-a-name-why-were-using-watt-hours-to-compare-batteries/"&gt;less accurate and harder to compare&lt;/a&gt; devices, so we prefer watt-hours. Here are the battery sizes of Apple’s new phones and the previous-gen models, according to the document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pdIdxH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10757785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2EYbYy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fmore-resources%2Fgtc.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; it provides this information to Chemtrec to help carriers comply, so this information comes directly from the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KxUwvs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 12 and 12 Pro had the same size battery, but the 13 and 13 Pro seemingly don’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDpfkR"&gt;A few things jump out in the chart. The sizes have obviously gotten significantly bigger across the board, and there’s one weird year-over-year change: the 12 and 12 Pro used to have the same size battery, but now the 13 Pro’s battery is actually smaller than the 13’s. The phones are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22674143/apple-iphone-13-pro-12-samsung-galaxy-pixel-android-comparison-specs"&gt;the same physical size,&lt;/a&gt; and the Pro is packing a higher refresh rate screen, an extra GPU core, and more cameras, so it makes sense if there’s less room for the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1MSRz"&gt;Apple also made each model slightly thicker and heavier than its predecessor. With this iPhone 13 lineup, the company seemingly makes the same tradeoff as it did with the 11: bigger phones with a better battery (a move that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20859715/iphone-11-pro-max-battery-life-size-thickness-weight-apple"&gt;garnered a good amount of praise&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZN5KK"&gt;As a few points of comparison, here are the rated capacities we were able to find for other phones and devices by consulting iFixit’s teardowns: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="R6BDva"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/m4vrgZ3PqskbyvKM.huge"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;: 18.84Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p36QTs"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oR3xLWXumQOWvDOi.huge"&gt;Google Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;: 15.48Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UfT2Nd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fGLArIvH1JFVZruL.huge"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;: 16.96Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZybyL"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMbVvMqgfc4HxXFV.huge"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;: 16Wh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LDKPhp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPad%2BAir%2B4%2BTeardown%2F141032&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22678607%2Fiphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;: 28.93Wh (the same capacity noted in the Chemtrec document)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DCjeMQ"&gt;According to the numbers found in the document, the 13 Pro Max’s 16.75Wh battery represents a healthy fraction of what you’ll find in some laptop batteries. It’s got 71 percent of the capacity of my ThinkPad T480’s main battery (rated for 23.48Wh), and it’s a bit more than 33 percent of the MacBook Air’s all-day 49.9 watt-hour battery. Plus, it’s bigger than the Switch’s battery, and that thing can run &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqjGcGKlVAElNFJ3tyaA1-HB8j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22856676/Screen_Shot_2021_09_16_at_5.43.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the iPhone 12 Pro Max will get you 2.5 hours further into your day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hIxjqF"&gt;Given that the phones’ processor is changing and displays are getting brighter, it’s hard to say how much real-world battery life these battery size increases can give you. In its presentation, Apple said that the new batteries would last 1.5 hours “longer in your day” for the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=3154"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=4401"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and 2.5 hours later for the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=3156"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EvGOlAkLSLw?t=4407"&gt;13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;. By Apple’s measure, if your iPhone 12 tapped out at 9:30PM, it expects the iPhone 13 will make it to midnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSK5MX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to say how much extra time you’ll actually get using your phone at this point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YmdME7"&gt;It’s not a particularly meaningful metric without context (though according to Apple, the iPhone 13 will get 4 more hours of streamed video playback than its predecessor, and the 13 Pro Max will get 13 more hours), so we’ll have to wait to see how the phones hold up to real-life usage and how they fare in the side-by-side rundown tests. However, Apple has made the battery a selling point for these phones, so it’s in the company’s best interest to back that up with some impressive numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Digital messages from patients to doctors spiked during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intensive care unit of the university hospital in Kiel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6IXo8ALnmmoek06eSNtAc2Jo9X8=/0x2:7088x4727/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872837/1229940392.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Frank Molter/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncuwgc"&gt;Doctors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1438151472089239555"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they’re overwhelmed by the volume of digital messages they receive from patients during the pandemic, and new data backs up their experience. The number of messages increased by over 150 percent at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the levels stayed high over the course of 2020, according to an early look at data from the electronic health record company Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsOWcy"&gt;“They want to be responsive to the patient needs,” says A Jay Holmgren, an assistant professor in the Center for Clinical Informatics and Improvement Research at the University of California San Francisco, who collected the data and posted it on Twitter this week. But there aren’t good systems in place to help doctors to manage the influx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wosjCI"&gt;There are few reasons why messaging might have spiked, Holmgren says. At the start of the pandemic, people may have wanted to avoid going to the doctor’s office and messaged their doctors instead. The pandemic might also have made people more aware that the option existed — and they stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ZqNI5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic might also have made people more aware that the option existed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ECoFh"&gt;“People started making telehealth appointments, those exploded around the pandemic,” he says. Patients would have had to use the online portal through their electronic health record to set up the appointment, where they may have seen the messaging option for the first time. Because messaging stayed high over 2020 — even at times COVID-19 cases were lower — Holmgren suspects that might play a bigger role. “I think it’s more of an awareness thing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNcJQD"&gt;Epic shared data on patient messaging with Holmgren as part of a project he’s working on looking at how use of electronic health records changed during the pandemic. It includes information from 366 health systems. Individual patients’ information is not included, so he can’t see what types of patients may have sent the messages or what they messaged about. But it gives an overall picture of the increase, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdnhM7"&gt;Holmgren posted the data on Twitter as part of a conversation about overloaded inboxes and physician burnout. “We turned on 24/7/365 access for patients (who of course like it) with no operational or business model to handle it,” wrote Bob Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1ceJdy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a real thing, and to quantify somewhat - national data from Epic shows messages from patients received per day up 157% over pre-pandemic amounts through end of 2020 (y-axis is percent change compared to health system's pre-COVID baseline) &lt;a href="https://t.co/bQoAWCi2YM"&gt;https://t.co/bQoAWCi2YM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4XirrOliFW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4XirrOliFW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— A Jay Holmgren (@AJHolmgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AJHolmgren/status/1438191114511523844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nKbdeU"&gt;Messages from patients are a small portion of the dozens of emails most doctors get each day, and the raw number of messages directly from patients is probably still low, Holmgren says — they may have started with one or two messages a day before 2020, and then received three or four a day from patients during 2020. “But these are the messages that take the most time,” he says. “If a patient asks you a question, you really need to answer it either by messaging them back, or scheduling an appointment or phone call.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pcS6O"&gt;It’s not clear yet what messages are primarily used for: they might be replacing doctor’s appointments in some cases. But they could also be unnecessary additions in other situations. A better understanding of why people are messaging their doctors, overall, could help develop strategies for managing the influx — like methods of sorting or directing messages, and ways to align the costs with the amount of work. That would benefit both physicians and patients. “You could get into this position where you can send your message, but the doctor doesn’t respond for a couple of weeks because they’re so overloaded with messages,” Holmgren says. “Then it’s not a useful tool anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f67INH"&gt;Improvements could help build a better foundation for at-home healthcare. There are more and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526024/apple-health-app-data-medical-record-iphone-doctor-access"&gt;more tools&lt;/a&gt; available to give doctors information on patients’ health day-to-day, in between appointments, but it takes experience with digital systems to make use of them. “You want to be able to message with your patients electronically before you start installing remote patient monitoring, or using wearables that automatically send you oxygen stats,” Holmgren says. “This is a good way to start building to that next level.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtahah"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A privacy-focused permissions feature from Android 11 is coming to older phones too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZgaquvQgZ2gKVdTnItmzMkM6k1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69872738/acastro_180507_1777_android_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AS99BC"&gt;Android 11’s auto-resetting permissions, where the operating system will restrict an app’s permission to access sensitive phone features like its storage or cameras if it hasn’t been opened for several months, are coming to older devices, Google has announced. The feature originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;launched with Android 11&lt;/a&gt; last year, but soon it’ll be available on any phones running Android 6 and above with Google Play services, which Google says should cover “billions” of Android phones released since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCyqqr"&gt;The feature is designed to help protect your privacy by preventing older apps from having unfettered access to your phone if you haven’t used them in months. You might be happy to give a novelty camera app access to your storage while it’s all the rage, but there’s a good chance you’ll forget it’s installed soon after. Android’s security feature is designed to step in and reset these permissions once it becomes clear that an app is no longer in regular use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wb3QTR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automatically enabled on Android 6.0 and up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uWVJ2P"&gt;According to Google, the feature “will automatically be enabled on devices with Google Play services that are running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher.” However, it has to be enabled manually for apps that aren’t targeting Android 11. Apps might ask users to disable this privacy feature if they’re regularly required to work in the background without you opening them, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXZn6E"&gt;According to Google, the feature will begin to roll out in December on devices running Android 6 to Android 10 with Google Play Services, before reaching all such devices in the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
