    <title>Amazon says it’s permanently banned 600 Chinese brands for review fraud</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z61jOZ"&gt;Remember when gadget vendors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Aukey, Mpow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;RavPower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;Vava, TaoTronics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;Choetech&lt;/a&gt; started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;mysteriously disappearing&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon’s online storefront, and it turned out Amazon had intentionally yanked them while vaguely gesturing to the sanctity of its user reviews? Turns out they were just the tip of the iceberg. Amazon has now permanently banned over 600 Chinese brands across 3,000 different seller accounts, the company confirms to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5pq9J"&gt;Amazon says that’s the grand tally after five months of its global crackdown, and it’s no longer being shy about why: a spokesperson tells us these 600 brands were banned for knowingly, repeatedly and significantly violating Amazon’s policies, especially the ones around review abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oNtph"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3149203/amazon-closes-3000-chinese-brand-online-stores-campaign-against-fake?utm_source=rss_feed"&gt;reported the numbers earlier&lt;/a&gt;, citing an interview with an Amazon Asia VP on state-owned television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQLuNT"&gt;Amazon’s crackdown began amidst &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;reporting by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; Nicole Ngyuen&lt;/a&gt; about how companies like RavPower offered gift cards in exchange for reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wq6uig"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following my fake review story, listings for Amazon-native electronics brand RAVPower are gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company offered $35 gift cards for reviews on a product that was sold directly by Amazon itself. RAVPower acted as a wholesale vendor on that listing.&lt;a href="https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb"&gt;https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/znp9u48YHV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/znp9u48YHV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nic nguyen (@nicnguyen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cto0HY"&gt;I’ve been collecting cards like this as well. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;banned the practice of incentivized reviews&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, but it’s a tricky business: some of these offers are disguised as a VIP testing program or an extended warranty. Other companies only offer incentives after you’ve left a bad review — they’ll give you a free product or offer a “refund” of free money, no return required, as long as you’ll delete your negative review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xxz4A0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is Amazon Prime Day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humble request: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you get any insert cards in your new purchases (they don't need to look this suspicious), please send me photos of them at sean@theverge.com for a story. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7337ookNPp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7337ookNPp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1407416198623494144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8uCW1E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Banned brands are slipping through&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rFvBg4"&gt;It’s not clear which other Chinese brands might be included in Amazon’s latest crackdown — and it’s quite possible some of their products will escape Amazon’s net. Even though Aukey was one of the first high-profile companies to get banned in May, the company was still selling earbuds under a sub-brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/25/22593165/amazon-aukey-key-series-mpow-xmpow-banned"&gt;as of July&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Key-Wireless-Bluetooth-Charging-Playtime/dp/B07QQT9LBF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a pair of them&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon even today. I also found &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CHOETECH-Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Qi-Enabled/dp/B07K83PG57/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Choetech wireless charging pad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/RAV-Portable-15000mAh-Charging-iPhone12/dp/B09F32SX88?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a RavPower battery&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve asked Amazon to explain its policies around ban dodging, and we’ll let you know what we hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MzHNT"&gt;In early July, the parent company of Shenzhen Youkeshu Technology (more commonly known as YKS) reported that Amazon had closed 340 of YKS’s online stores and frozen over $20 million worth of its assets, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3140379/one-largest-made-china-sold-amazon-companies-had-340-stores-closed?module=inline&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=article&amp;amp;pgtype=article"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication described YKS as one of the platform’s largest Chinese retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00Ia0p"&gt;Here’s Amazon’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbHpi"&gt;Amazon works hard to build a great experience in our store so that customers can shop with confidence and sellers have the opportunity to grow their business amid healthy competition.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Customers rely on the accuracy and authenticity of product reviews to make informed purchasing decisions and we have clear policies for both reviewers and selling partners that prohibit abuse of our community features. We suspend, ban, and take legal action against those who violate these policies, wherever they are in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCdLyh"&gt;We will continue to improve abuse detection and take enforcement action against bad actors, including those that knowingly engage in multiple and repeated policy violations, including review abuse. We are confident that the steps we take are in the best interests of our customers as well as the honest businesses that make up the vast majority of our global selling community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>8 new HomeKit features arriving with Apple’s September 20th software updates  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFrB4RSo4qr_67XyNG51mEUjUcU=/0x400:2400x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874081/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sm4we8"&gt;With new iPhones come new features. And starting next week, Apple HomeKit users will get plenty courtesy of iOS 15, HomePod 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8 software updates. Apple has confirmed that these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;will all be available on the same day, September 20th&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k51FQ2"&gt;So, if you’ve been excited about unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras, the HomePod Mini as a speaker for your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22672587/apple-tv-tvos-15-features-release-date"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt;, or the chance to see your doorbell on your Apple Watch, you’re in luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn6TDY"&gt;Here’s a look at all the new HomeKit and HomeKit-related features that will be dropping on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jo8NY2eGt7DG9iorfWFYTw-oYsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22025414/dseifert_201107_4281_0005.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update will let you pair a single or pair of HomePod Minis to your Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6Won2G"&gt;Control your Apple TV with Siri on HomePod&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="w9RK6D"&gt;Finally, you’ll be able to use Siri on your HomePod to turn your Apple TV on and off, start a specific show or movie, or have it pause or resume playback for you. This has been a feature of Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant’s smart speakers for a while now (when paired with a Fire TV device or Chromecast), and we’re pleased to see Apple bringing Siri speakers up to par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tFdFkO"&gt;Set your HomePod Mini as your Apple TV speaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxwnW"&gt;A single or pair of HomePod Minis can now be your Apple TV 4K’s default speaker. This feature was previously only available to the original (now discontinued) HomePod, but now it’s available for Apple’s more diminutive (and not discontinued) smart speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RxuJOq-o28fiEPHDe-8suVrAQzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22541099/DSCF3862_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple TV 4K can now show you multiple HomeKit camera feeds on the biggest screen in your house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUE4J2"&gt;Have your HomeKit cameras spot packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pLPGEg"&gt;Security cameras connected to Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video (Apple’s option for storing footage from your smart home cameras) through an Apple TV 4K or HomePod Mini can now tell you when they see a package. This is in addition to people, animal, and vehicle detection and will increase the usefulness of the two HKSV compatible residential doorbells currently on the market — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163585/logitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video"&gt;Logitech View&lt;/a&gt; and the Netatmo Smart Video Doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SRazyy"&gt;See multiple HomeKit cameras on your Apple TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Im16Y5"&gt;The Apple TV can now stream multiple feeds from your HomeKit cameras instead of only one, so you can survey your domain from the big screen. It will also offer up control of nearby accessories (such as a front door lock or porch light), so you can turn on the lights and unlock the door using the remote - no need to get your phone out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OMjPaC"&gt;Add unlimited HomeKit Secure Video cameras&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oVMCFU"&gt;Speaking of multiple cameras, with the iOS15 update on your iPhone and iPad you can now add an unlimited number of cameras to HomeKit Secure Video if you sign up for the new iCloud Plus 2TB plan ($9.99 a month). Previously, 5 was the maximum number allowed, which is a bit limiting if you want to cover a whole home inside and out with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV3g8Rm4NYnw6didqLbXbN_KBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16308986/dseifert_190530_3460_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ecobee SmartThermostat is the first confirmed Siri-enabled accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sKsTIh"&gt;Talk to Siri in more places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vqGlQF"&gt;The voice assistant is coming to other speaker-enabled HomeKit accessories. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt; is the only confirmed accessory so far — and the function won’t go live for a few more weeks, according to Ecobee. But it’s likely more devices will follow soon, enabling you to ask Siri to control smart home devices, set timers and alarms, and use the intercom feature in more rooms in your home. You will still need to have a HomePod Mini on the same network for the device to relay the requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AQaTqY"&gt;Tell Siri to do something later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6VW0TX"&gt;Siri is getting smarter about home control, adding the ability for you to ask the voice assistant to do something later or based on an event. That means you’ll be able to use commands such as “Hey Siri, turn off the lights when I leave home,” or “Hey Siri, turn off the TV at 6 p.m.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vpr6RaUnkXF2S_If_9TwlUqEZrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858560/apple_wwdc21_watchos8_home_doorbell_06072021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new software update for Apple Watch lets you view your HomeKit cameras on your watch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Enr29Y"&gt;Control your home on your wrist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zXy3Gj"&gt;With WatchOS 8, the Apple Home app gets a much-needed redesign. Now you can access individual accessories as well as HomeKit Scenes, and the watch will use context to determine which devices and Scenes to offer up for control. You can also see HomeKit-enabled camera feeds on your wrist and use Intercom to quickly broadcast a message to the whole home, individual rooms, or personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wj04Cg"&gt;To update your HomePod and HomePod Mini’s software, go to the Home Settings in the Apple Home app (you can turn on automatic updates here). For Apple TV 4K, look in the settings menu on your device and for the Apple Watch, use the Watch app on your iPhone or the settings app on the watch itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9ecwb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 6:47PM ET, September 17th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that the article is referring to Siri on a HomePod to control the Apple TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s first private crew shows what they’ve been up to in orbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cg4tbAsEzb-5W-_1vO1_OVixe1A=/0x7:730x494/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874557/E_dZJNZWEAAKc2H.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GupVQ3"&gt;It was a brief orbital talent show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmiXOH"&gt;“Hayley is a champ at spinning,” Sian Proctor, one of the four private citizens currently orbiting Earth inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, said of her crew mate Hayley Arceneaux, who was somersaulting in the weightlessness of space on camera. “She’s been spinning ever since we got on orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1Z9WXXJRzZZD2eMtIAOpnb0UGg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859021/Sep_17_2021_18_11_48.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hayley Arceneaux spinning inside Crew Dragon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yAlKCy"&gt;Christopher Sembroski, another crew mate, whipped out a ukulele and threatened to play it live on camera to over 55,000 viewers on SpaceX’s live YouTube stream — “You can turn your volume down if you wish, but I’ll give it a shot.” He did a little riff while Arceneaux was holding the mic, and it wasn’t half bad. “It’s still before coffee, so it’ll get better before the day goes on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GaJ817"&gt;Proctor showed off a drawing she made using a pack of metallic pens that depicted the Crew Dragon capsule blasting off Earth and leaving a trail of exhaust that looks like a dragon. “I have really enjoyed learning how to use markers in space,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DJO5zbRKavy8AHOQ3J8LGmVDNAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859023/Sep_17_2021_18_08_07.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Proctor shows off some artwork&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0VgsNS"&gt;The four-person Inspiration4 crew, which includes billionaire entrepreneur and the mission’s funder Jared Isaacman, has been zipping around the planet 15 times a day since Wednesday night, when they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;blasted to space on top of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket from Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Friday afternoon, they gave their first update on what they’ve been up to in a live YouTube video nearly two days after lifting off — the lack of public communication itself an indicator that space is no longer just for government astronauts, who are typically far more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5N2lo5"&gt;Proctor, Arceneaux, Sembroski and Isaacman represent the first fully private contingent of humans to enter orbit without the aegis of professionally trained astronauts. They also represent the inaugural private crew flown by SpaceX, which has flown just three crews of government astronauts before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQFTp1"&gt;“We’re really proud to share this experience with everyone, we know how fortunate we are to be up here,” Isaacman said on camera. “We’re giving all of our time to science research and some ukulele-playing, and trying to raise some good awareness for an important cause back on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5HpAb"&gt;Unlike Crew Dragon flights for government astronauts, who trek to the International Space Station, the Inspiration4’s spacecraft came equipped with a glass dome installed where Crew Dragon’s docking door would normally be. Proctor held the camera up to the dome, which appeared big enough to easily fit the upper torsos of three people. Facing Earth, it was dark outside, and the live camera feed was choppy and pixelated, but the crew could see the array of night lights dotting Earth’s surface. “Ooh, that looks like the aurora!” Proctor said. “Oh wow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dWoM9K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

They’ve completed more than 15 orbits around planet Earth since liftoff and made full use of the Dragon cupola. &lt;a href="https://t.co/StK4BTWSA6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/StK4BTWSA6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Inspiration4 (@inspiration4x) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inspiration4x/status/1438716982564696065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="zyWDoQ"&gt;Aside from the milestones, the Inspiration4 mission is primarily a massive fundraising event for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a non-profit that conducts cancer research and gives free care to kids with cancer. The goal is $200 million; Isaacman donated the first $100 million and paid for the crew’s seats for an undisclosed amount. The rest is being raised through various efforts: some of the items the crew took with them to space — like hops for beer, NFTs, pieces of art, and stuffed animals — are supported by sponsorships from companies that have committed thousands in donations to St. Jude or will be &lt;a href="https://www.charitybuzz.com/support/StJude"&gt;auctioned off once back on Earth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnVj2W"&gt;The crew also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xnBajP0Kus&amp;amp;t=1s&amp;amp;ab_channel=St.JudeChildren%27sResearchHospital"&gt;video chatted with St. Jude patients&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYSE/status/1438960197666578435?s=20"&gt;rang the bell&lt;/a&gt; on the New York Stock Exchange (Isaacman’s payment-processing company, Shift4 Payments, is publicly traded). Isaacman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BetMGM/status/1438607327201013765?s=20"&gt;placed a $4,000 bet&lt;/a&gt; to Las Vegas that the Eagles would win the Super Bowl. In the live video, Arceneaux showed off a device the crew is using to measure cranial pressure as part of a scientific study to monitor how their bodies behave in microgravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn0oSq"&gt;The Inspiration4 mission is expected to last about three days. They’ll reenter Earth’s atmosphere and splashdown in one of several locations off the coast of Florida on Saturday at around 7:06PM ET, SpaceX said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic is shutting down its AR Catan game after a year of early access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-_LMUDJqQP_ybXjs7mdZ9MB6sk=/102x0:1946x1229/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874501/Launch_Key_Art_v2.11_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Zp4Ai"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; developer Niantic is shutting down its augmented reality game &lt;em&gt;Catan: World Explorers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://community.catanworldexplorers.com/discussion/1811/catan-world-explorers-is-shutting-down/p1"&gt;the company announced on Friday&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/pokemon-go-maker-niantic-is-shutting-down-its-ar-catan-game"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). An AR adaptation of the popular board game &lt;em&gt;Catan &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976421/settlers-of-catan-ar-niantic-world-explorers-pokemon-go-augmented-reality"&gt;announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World Explorers &lt;/em&gt;was the company’s latest attempt to recreate the magic of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go,&lt;/em&gt; but soon it’s all coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOeBo5"&gt;After a year of early access, the game will not be playable after November 18th and Niantic says later today it “will be taking the game down from the App Store and removing real-money purchases from the Shop.” For the players that stick around, the company says it will increase in-game bonuses for the remaining weeks the game is live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T3MPWL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Surely something other than Pokémon can catch on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5gIKb"&gt;It’s not entirely clear what’s to blame for the shutdown, though the developers says that adapting the trading, harvesting, and building &lt;em&gt;Catan&lt;/em&gt; is known for on a real-life (or at least AR layered on top of real-life) game board proved to be a challenge. “We got a little too complicated and a little too far from the original &lt;em&gt;Catan &lt;/em&gt;game,” the developers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJ8d5J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan: World Explorers&lt;/em&gt; joins &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; as another AR game that it couldn’t quite cut it. Microsoft’s vision for &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18627341/minecraft-earth-ios-android-free-ar-game-features-pokemon-go"&gt;similarly ambitious&lt;/a&gt; until it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;brought to an end on June 30th&lt;/a&gt;. It’s too bad Niantic’s big swing failed because its other entries have proved to be disappointing in our experience. At launch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; felt more like a skin of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; than a meaningful evolution. There’s no reason why Pokémon should be the exclusive breakthrough hit for AR gaming, but until Niantic or another company can make it work, it seems like Pikachu will remain king. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19SobT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated Niantic developed Minecraft Earth. It was actually developed by Microsoft-owned Mojang Studios. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUjg6X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder Apple’s new iPad and iPad Mini</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJh377rgCk0xrZL9VTIMCiq3dLo=/1x0:1960x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857722/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ztdXBm"&gt;As expected, Apple’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;California Streaming&lt;/a&gt;” was loaded with a flurry of announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also used its annual fall showcase to introduce its latest tablets, specifically the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;ninth-gen iPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;all-new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is a follow-up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;2019 iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that takes heavy design cues from last year’s iPad Air. The new models are set to launch on Friday, September 24th, starting at $329 and $499, respectively, and preorders have already gone live at several retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgwE0u"&gt;We’ll have reviews up for both models in the near future, however, if you’re looking to purchase Apple’s latest tablets ahead of release, you have a few options to consider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yMH3Z4"&gt;Where to buy the all-new iPad Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U3t2M7"&gt;Spec-wise, the new iPad Mini is a far cry from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;original iPad Mini model&lt;/a&gt; and one of the bigger revamps to come to Apple’s smallest tablet since it made its debut in 2012. The sixth-gen model features slimmer bezels, an A15 Bionic chip, and a larger, 8.3-inch display. Like the iPad Air, the forthcoming tablet also ditches the aging home button, adds USB-C support, and incorporates a Touch ID sensor within the top-mounted power button. It also supports 5G and Wi-Fi 6, works with the second-gen Apple Pencil, and features a 12MP ultrawide camera on the front, allowing for the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage feature&lt;/a&gt; Apple introduced with the iPad Pro last year. Additionally, like the ninth-gen iPad, it ships with iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fECKGb"&gt;The latest iPad Mini comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in four colorways (purple, pink, starlight, and space gray). The 64GB configuration retails for $499 and the 256GB model for $649; both models are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91LXFP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FiPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Starlight%2F211557522&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664337-REG%2Fapple_mk7m3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752240155828388288#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-64gb%2F-%2FA-84619867%3Fpreselect%3D77615852%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; with shipments expected to arrive before the tablet’s launch on Friday, September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rnMmYG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPad Mini doesn’t support mmWave 5G ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="0DybVI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jyQB1V"&gt;Like the Wi-Fi model, the iPad Mini with cellular connectivity is available in two sizes: 64GB and 256GB. Both come in an array of colors — purple, pink, starlight, and space gray — with prices starting at $649 and $799, respectively. Both configurations are also available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9GM743/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F664584591&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664343-REG%2Fapple_mk893ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241079262357667#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-cellular%2F-%2FA-84619869%3Fpreselect%3D77615846%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lsq6xQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743742"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CBe2E6"&gt;Where to buy the new entry-level iPad &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZJ1f5"&gt;The entry-level iPad remains the most popular tablet in Apple’s lineup. The ninth-generation model keeps the same name the tablet has had since its introduction in 2010, but showcases several updates, including a new processor called the A13 Bionic, which is supposedly 20 percent faster than the outgoing model. Thanks to a 12MP camera on the front, the forthcoming device also supports Apple’s aforementioned Center Stage feature, however, the rest of the updates are more trivial. The new iPad still comes equipped with the same 10.2-inch display as before — this time with Apple’s True Tone technology — as well as a Lightning port, home button, and a single rear camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blvpwY"&gt;The new iPad comes in two different storage configurations, 64GB and 256GB, and in two colorways, silver and space gray. The 64GB configuration starts at $329 and the 256GB model for $479; both models are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-10-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664329-REG%2Fapple_mk2k3ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241380893659528#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-10-2-inch-ipad-wi-fi%2F-%2FA-84619866%3Fpreselect%3D54184190%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments set to arrive before the tablet’s official launch on Friday, September 24th. Walmart is even &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F674982024&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offering a $30 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the base model, bringing the final sale price down to just $299 for the 64GB, Wi-Fi configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XTmmmK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ8Eig"&gt;Like previous models, the ninth-gen iPad also comes in a cellular configuration, which is available in both 64GB and 256GB storage capacities in one of two colors (silver and space gray). Both storage configurations are available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPad091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-10-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9GLLRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F664584591&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipad2021preorder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664333-REG%2Fapple_mk663ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22665133%2Fapple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752241665105047552#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, with the 64GB variant retailing for $459 and the 256GB model for $609.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad Mini (2021) is the latest in Apple’s line of smaller tablets.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVuL8X"&gt;With the announcement and impending release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and its revamped design, it might be all too easy to stan the new model and completely write off its predecessor. While the new model has a lot to offer — namely a larger screen, faster processor, refined design akin to the 2020 iPad Air, and a USB-C port — it also has a quality that is not so desirable: a higher introductory price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLobXP"&gt;The iPad Mini line has been notoriously discount-immune over the years, possibly because of its specialized position in the market and lack of competition. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;outgoing iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; only recently started receiving significant discounts, falling to $300 soon before the new model was announced, but it started at $399 from the get-go. The new iPad Mini starts at $499 before you add anything further, like extra storage or 5G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoiSPN"&gt;So let’s go over what makes the new iPad Mini different, and if it merits the $200 price premium over its two-year-old predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kWTH6E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s iPhone 13 event: the 8 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNokVD5epfyoanYvxROAZ9oLPTc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850130/apple_event_2021_1046.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini for 2021 packs more screen and modern design in a diminutive size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fW1Guf"&gt;What’s improved on the 2021 iPad Mini?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tA9ela"&gt;The new iPad Mini has a bigger screen in a slightly smaller physical footprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n69sTd"&gt;Apple’s A15 Bionic processor replaces the aging A12 Bionic from 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A7O1mJ"&gt;The front camera has more resolution and supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; to zoom in and keep you centered during video calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lYeJBw"&gt;The rear camera is higher resolution and can now record 4K video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gdxpod"&gt;USB-C all the things! (except iPhones, sadly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GEAZDV"&gt;No more Apple Pencil sticking out of the port to charge: second-gen Apple Pencil neatly attaches to the side to charge magnetically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SNPmtZ"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 compatibility &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GV0uQs"&gt;5G connection on cellular models for potentially faster speeds than LTE, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"&gt;lacking mmWave 5G radio bands&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MNixNm"&gt;The showstopper for the new iPad Mini is its screen, now an 8.3-inch display. It may not sound like a massive difference compared to the 7.9-inch display on the 2019 model, but the new tablet is actually a touch shorter while squeezing in a larger screen. More screen real estate and smaller bezels in nearly the same footprint is generally a good thing that makes everyone happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUu690"&gt;As for processing power, the new iPad Mini features the same brand-new A15 Bionic chip you’ll find in the iPhone 13 lineup, with five GPU cores like the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. (That’s one more than the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.) Apple claims the new chip gives the Mini a maxi performance boost, with 40 percent CPU gains and 80 percent GPU gains over the older A12 Bionic in the outgoing model. There’s talk of it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678389/apple-ipad-mini-no-mmwave-downclocked-a15"&gt;not being clocked quite as fast as the A15 processor of the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, but that remains to be confirmed and the improvements over the previous iPad Mini are likely noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zB6GzP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The camera tech of the iPad Mini sounds like a solid upgrade on paper&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JLvnc"&gt; A 12MP ultrawide front camera replaces the 7MP selfie cam from 2019. More resolution on the front camera may not sound like the most important thing in the world, but the big appeal should be that the new iPad Mini supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt; for keeping you centered during video calls. The quality has also been improved — while still 1080p, it has improved dynamic range with more frame rate options for video and Smart HDR 3 for photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfaFFh"&gt;As for the rear camera, there are similar resolution and recording gains with a 12MP sensor and brighter f/1.8 aperture, replacing the prior 8MP @ f/2.4. The faster aperture should be helpful in low light, and for when it’s way too dark there’s now a quad-LED True Tone flash where the 2019 model had no flash at all. On the video side, the new model is the first in the iPad Mini line to offer 4K video recording at up to 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncuFA65v4fZQrYnuxxe0gdDFiPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850183/lcimg_90987419_14bd_47ba_b425_5984e2255904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini comes in four colorways: space gray, purple, pink, and starlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d4ll3L"&gt;The latest iPad Mini now aligns with the iPad Pros and 2020 iPad Air by replacing the Lightning connector with USB-C. Apple spoke extensively of the flexibility that USB-C brings to the iPad Mini, even though for some reason the new iPhone doesn’t receive the same treatment. This offers more versatility for charging and connecting devices, such as full-size cameras or game controllers. You also get the faster 20-watt USB-C charger in the box, while even a $1,600 iPhone 13 Pro Max does not come with a charging brick at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H29froDJmJ7jGd02m_Yr6TsF07M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13358115/Apple_Pencil_Bad_Design.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This charging design is still bad, and it should feel bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YWVICT"&gt;The iPad Mini line became compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil in 2019, awkward charging method and all. With the new iPad Mini, you don’t need to leave it sticking out the side: it supports the newer second-gen Pencil, which can wirelessly charge while it magnetically docks to the tablet’s side rail. It’s a much more slick and seamless way of getting more functionality out of this little tablet. If you also want to add a keyboard to the mix, there are wireless Bluetooth options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxU9aM"&gt;Lastly, the cellular-equipped configurations of the new iPad Mini are 5G-compatible where the predecessor only has LTE. As for if 5G truly gets you faster speeds, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;you know the drill&lt;/a&gt;. But whether you achieve those faster speeds or not, having a mobile connection on such a portable device is convenient. A 5G iPad Mini (2021) will run you an additional $150, pushing the price to $649 (before carrier fees). Ouch. At least all 2021 iPad Mini configurations have Wi-Fi 6, allowing for faster speeds at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KHBfrZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="I8pkqR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10758598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GOxbwa"&gt;What’s the same on both models?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7ktDMN"&gt;While the new screen is larger, it has the same number of pixels per inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjITJc"&gt;Both screens are laminated to minimize the gap between cover glass and screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zFOavb"&gt;Maximum brightness of 500 nits for both panels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j92pzj"&gt;Touch ID fingerprint sensors are present on both – just in different locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pdsk3o"&gt;Apple quotes the same battery life for both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TYzAjL"&gt;Storage capacity still starts at 64GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZC10WG"&gt;Weight is practically identical (within 8 grams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MvoelB"&gt;Both run iPadOS 15&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FU4YeT"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the screen is the standout of the new model, but you should keep in mind that the pixel density is the same on both. The 2021 iPad Mini has a resolution of 2266 x 1488 and the 2019 iPad Mini has a 2048 x 1536 panel, which both translate to 326 ppi. So both screens should look equally sharp, though the 2021 model is giving you more screen real estate. Also, both screens are laminated, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;base-model iPad&lt;/a&gt;, so the pixels should look like they come right up to the cover glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHW3Zx"&gt;Another similarity is storage capacity. The new and old models both start with 64GB of storage and can be outfitted with 256GB for an additional $150. This might be a disappointment for some, especially given the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"&gt;iPhone 13 models doubled their base storage to 128GB this year&lt;/a&gt;, though. You may want to do some personal bookkeeping and see how much storage you currently use before paying extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ijGU5leA7gYTi_720eLC0BfzSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850355/Apple_iPad_mini_touch_id_09142021_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iPad Mini’s Touch ID sensor is now in the power button, opposite the volume buttons on the top rail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EwtSd2"&gt;What about software, though? Well, there’s not a whole lot to say. The new iPad Mini will ship with iPadOS 15, and the 2019 model will be eligible to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;upgrade on September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The only main difference between the two tablets is the new model’s reliance on more gesture-based controls, due to its removal of the home button that is still present on the 2019 model. Since the new model ditched the home button, its Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the sleep/power button on the top — which is also where the volume buttons are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="W8yhf2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 preview: a first look at Apple’s latest software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_f3z8bOTLHy8XPZWdaY6WFdmMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15974614/akrales_190318_3298_0088.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The outgoing iPad Mini (2019) still has some merits in 2021, especially if you’re on a budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EGMMfc"&gt;Why might you stick with the 2019 iPad Mini?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fkPZxB"&gt;Price: the older iPad Mini is currently on sale for $200 less than the new model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VQfGg6"&gt;It’s still a fine tablet even today, with more years of updates to come&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xVvxRb"&gt;It has a headphone jack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="T6FEN6"&gt;Classic home button operation for those who prefer it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="A4n2Uo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="986U7H"&gt;The outgoing iPad Mini still has more than a few great things going for it. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is frankly depressing to lose on the new model. All tablets — even mini ones — should have enough room for a headphone jack, but that’s a rant for another time. The 2019 iPad Mini also has the classic physical home button on its front, complete with Touch ID. The gesture controls of newer Apple products may not be for everyone, and there are still many who love the clicky home button. There’s no shame in picking up a 2019 iPad Mini in the year 2021 because you value these things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQj2x3"&gt;After all that, there’s the consideration of pricing. Slightly aged tech always has the added benefit of discounted prices before they’re no longer available. With the jump in price of the new iPad Mini, a $200 price delta is nothing to balk at. The 2021 iPad Mini has priced itself nearly into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; territory, and there are good arguments to be made for why you should maybe consider the Air instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hjqxpv"&gt;But if you’re in the market for a small tablet, the choice is primarily between these old and new iPad Minis. Like I mentioned, there’s not much competition in this space, which is why discounts have not always been common. The outgoing model should still have years of updates in store for it, and there’s a wide ecosystem of compatible accessories — most likely also with cheaper prices attached to them. We’ll have a full review of the iPad Mini in the weeks to come, and we’ll see if its new features justify the higher price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida man used Disney employee iPad to magically skip lines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Firework Show Back To Walt Disney World Resort In Lake Buena Vista" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ygcH5vTg43MHSyQYopvnuzzYrT8=/0x8:5976x3992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874177/1326577788.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Liao Pan/China News Service via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rEh3rD"&gt;There are tons of books and blogs telling you how to have a magical Disney World experience, but one Florida man discovered the ultimate travel hack: using an app that lets you skip lines running on a possibly stolen employee iPad (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/florida-man-used-a-stolen-disney-ipad-with-vip-app-to-l-1847679179"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/stolen-disney-ipad-tour-guide-trespassing-hollywood-studios/37598400"&gt;According to central Florida’s &lt;em&gt;WESH2&lt;/em&gt; news&lt;/a&gt;, 30 year-old Rennan Carletto allegedly did just that in June, by giving himself and a group traveling through the park with him an unauthorized jump to the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9YGhD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/state/man-with-stolen-disney-issued-ipad-caught-giving-tour-at-hollywood-studios"&gt;According to a WPTV report&lt;/a&gt;, Carletto was leading an unauthorized tour of Hollywood Studios (Disney World’s worst park, no offense) and using the iPad to skip lines for the park’s rides by making reservation overrides. One &lt;a href="https://www.disneydining.com/man-uses-cast-member-ipad-bypasses-lines-gives-tours-in-park-per-orange-county-sheriff-bb1/"&gt;Disney World fan site&lt;/a&gt; theorizes that he may have been taking advantage of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fguest-services%2Fdisability-access-service%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F17%2F22679895%2Fflorida-man-hollywood-studios-skips-lines-disney-employee-ipad-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney’s system that lets people with disabilities&lt;/a&gt; reserve certain times for a ride so they don’t have to wait in line. This would seemingly agree with &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2021/09/stolen-walt-disney-world-ipad-used-by-guest-with-tour-group-to-skip-ride-lines-at-theme-parks/"&gt;a quote reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;WDW News Today&lt;/em&gt;, which classified the app as “a private app for qualifying guests” that’s only installed on devices owned by Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YNRh7s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Having access to Disney’s private app sure beats FastPass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kXQl2r"&gt;However Carletto was pulling it off, it seems like it was both easier and better than the confusing FastPass/MaxPass reservation system (which is &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2021/08/18/disney-world-disneyland-fastpass-maxpass-disney-genie-ride-reservations/8176388002/"&gt;due to be replaced&lt;/a&gt; by a service called Genie Plus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgZlkf"&gt;Of course, as with every travel hack there were a few minor tradeoffs and inconveniences — Carletto ended up having to give the iPad back to a Disney investigator, and was issued a warning by Disney for trespassing. He reportedly told authorities that he didn’t know it was stolen (though it apparently wasn’t ever reported as such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7milhR"&gt;While I absolutely wouldn’t recommend trying to get your hands on an employee iPad, here’s one piece of travel advice from someone who grew up in Florida and had a December birthday: it’s almost winter, or at least &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida#Climate"&gt;what passes as winter in the Sunshine State&lt;/a&gt;, which means that Disney is entering what’s traditionally its slow season. While the wait times won’t be instant like they were for our friend Carletto, they’re likely to be significantly shorter in the off-season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse appears to be working on Waves, a new way to invite friends to rooms </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrPSIywn7HDH7kKdWq9OhkLIjq0=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69874026/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EBJ0p4"&gt;Clubhouse appears to be working on a new way to invite people to audio rooms in its app, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1438931407322042369?s=20"&gt;based on screenshots shared by researcher Jane Manchum Wong&lt;/a&gt;. The invite feature, called “Waves,” is focused on the more casual, social side of Clubhouse, rather than the creator-focused live shows that have had the company’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHXbpu"&gt;Based off the screenshots Wong shared, Waves lets you wave at friends —with a button identical to the hand in Clubhouse’s logo — to invite them to chat. If they reply, they automatically get added to an audio room so you can talk. A spokesperson declined to comment on Wong’s discovery, but it seems likely that the feature is intended for Clubhouse’s social rooms (one of &lt;a href="https://clubhouseapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002362141-What-are-the-different-room-types-"&gt;several audio room types&lt;/a&gt; the company offers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Clubhouse is working on Waves,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so that you can slowly form a room with your friends when they all are ready instead of having them to chat with you right away&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(hi clubhouse ;) i love this idea btw) &lt;a href="https://t.co/OrODAC5GmI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OrODAC5GmI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1438931407322042369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="VeDinP"&gt;Clubhouse finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;got rid of its waitlist in July&lt;/a&gt;, and has been picking up new features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648050/clubhouse-spatial-audio-3d-360-sound"&gt;like spatial audio support&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime. Chalk it up to &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does"&gt;the current obsession with the “creator economy”&lt;/a&gt; or an early business strategy, but Clubhouse has seemed more focused on the professional uses of its app — launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420644/clubhouse-creator-first-pilot-program-season-audio-social"&gt;a pilot program for new shows&lt;/a&gt;, for example — than its use as just another way to hang out online. That’s sparked competition all over the place, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Stage Channels on Discord&lt;/a&gt;, but Waves seems like a nice step back to the casual uses of drop-in / drop-out live audio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How and where to replace your old, depleted iPhone battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0mWSVXrKcWvnqpLBF_jKjRUrh0=/0x27:620x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873726/F8M9LXDIM0THNI6.MEDIUM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Credit: Apple Fixer/ Instructables&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKJuw9"&gt;Your iPhone’s aging lithium-ion batteries will eventually start to lose their ability to retain a charge — and that can be highly frustrating, especially if you’re out and about all day. If that is happening to you, there are several solutions: you can switch over to the latest &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeiPhoneBattery091721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, start carrying a battery charger around with you, or — simply replace the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPFe7"&gt;To first identify whether your battery is ready for a change, you can check to see what the current health of your battery is by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Battery” &amp;gt; “Battery Health.” This is where you can find out your battery’s current maximum capacity. A small notice at the very top may appear if your iPhone’s battery is ready for a swap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZBc9kffXfFCa7gpU87-JlyADATY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858291/IMG_FF5BFD69D52F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery” page in your iPhone’s settings has info about your battery usage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/izwvsvS0OzJtaWGbzH0tQT9sZ8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858292/IMG_CB3733A4E40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Battery Health” page will let you know if you need to replace your battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXkgXj"&gt;If you’ve decided to replace the battery, you have two choices: doing it yourself or hiring someone else — like Apple — to do it. Doing it yourself poses several risks — you void any remaining warranty, and you risk breaking your phone. But if you’d rather do it yourself, there are plenty of guides online, and the process is easier than you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lvRHsm"&gt;DIY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XajF1B"&gt;For those ready to take on this task, a good place to start is iFixit, which offers very in-depth explainers of how to proceed (for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2B11%2BBattery%2BReplacement%2F127450&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here is one to use if you own an iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt;). There are also a variety of YouTube videos available that offer step-by-step instructions. The process involves unscrewing the back of the phone, mildly heating the lower edge of the phone, using suction cups to remove the display, and follow several steps to remove and replace the battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0TUywh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Feyqwf3cYtw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LK0fm"&gt;Before you start, you’ll need &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bonafide-HardwareTM-Repair-Driver-Pentalobe/dp/B00XZB3WKQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;smartphone repair tools&lt;/a&gt;, which can cost around $13 (iFixit strongly recommends you add a suction tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DottorPod-iSclack-Opening-Apple-iPhones/dp/B07HWLYVQN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iSclack&lt;/a&gt;). Some vendors on Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/IBESTWIN-Replacement-Adhesive-Instruction-Capacity/dp/B07QNXHPP1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even sell iPhone battery replacement kits&lt;/a&gt; for this very purpose, which can run around $25 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1mF24"&gt;Be aware that If you do choose to do it yourself and you have a water resistant phone, your phone will no longer be water resistant after you’ve opened it up. In addition, there’s a good chance that your OS will recognize that there is no longer an Apple-manufactured battery in your phone, which means you may get an occasional warning notice and the Battery Health app won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ulr3WR"&gt;Get Apple to do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dsoHLA"&gt;If you’d rather get someone else to replace the battery and not risk tampering with your device, Apple offers replacements under several conditions, according to&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-power"&gt; its website&lt;/a&gt;. If your iPhone is under warranty or you have AppleCare+ and Apple deems the battery defective, repairs are free. But if the problem is due to some other factor that isn’t covered by AppleCare+ — or if you’re not covered by that or by a warranty — you’ll have to pay a service fee of $49 for an iPhone SE (2nd gen) up to an iPhone 8 Plus, or a $69 fee for more recent models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eR8A"&gt;You can either ship in your phone for repairs or head to an Apple store. A physical store repair could be completed in one visit or, in more complex cases, take up to three to five days, according to Apple. Shipping it in will take a bit longer, as you need to wait for Apple to send you a box to collect your iPhone. In addition, if your phone is out of warranty, there will be a $6.95 shipping fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIASV4"&gt;If Apple replaces your battery for you, the iPhone should continue to be water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWVN4X"&gt;If all this doesn’t work for you, your timeline, or your budget, there may also be third-party vendors who offer repair services for iPhones in your local neighborhood. But their quality — and whether they use &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FAnswers%2FView%2F343117%2FWill%2BiPhone%2B7%2Bkeep%2Bit%2527s%2Bwater%2Bresistance%2Bafter%2Brepair&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22679492%2Fiphone-apple-battery-replace-ifixit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sealing adhesive&lt;/a&gt; to maintain water resistance — varies by vendor, so always check reviews and ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdiqei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 21st, 2017, and has been updated to account for service, device, and OS changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Treasury to issue new cryptocurrency sanctions after ransomware attacks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hacker (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uf6k-WUl4lBZEQW9RTzILouUvSI=/3x0:1097x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69873608/hacker-stock1_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvFJjf"&gt;The Biden administration is preparing to issue a series of actions, including sanctions, to make it more difficult for hackers to profit off of ransomware attacks through the use of digital currency, as first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-target-crypto-ransomware-payments-with-sanctions-11631885336"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GjmPp"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the Treasury Department plans to impose these new sanctions as soon as next week. The sanctions would reportedly target specific traders and cryptocurrency exchanges, in the hope of deterring exchanges from processing these transactions when they’re made. The department will also issue new guidance for businesses regarding the risks they take on by complying with ransomware payment requests. The Treasury Department declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="os7Z2G"&gt;These proposed measures would be the Biden administration’s most significant move to address the wave of ransomware attacks that have only grown in scale and frequency over the last year. In May, one of the largest US pipelines, Colonial Pipeline, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;was taken offline&lt;/a&gt; after a ransomware attack. The company paid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;more than $4 million&lt;/a&gt; in ransom to the attackers in order to bring the pipeline back online. Earlier this month, Howard University closed after a ransomware attack interrupted the school’s computer and technology services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQH4Ug"&gt;In May, President &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; making it easier for government and private sector businesses to share information in the wake of cyberattacks. The order also required government agencies to deploy multi-factor authentication services in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goQKCR"&gt;The Biden administration is expected to issue new anti-money laundering and terror finance rules later this year to restrict the use of cryptocurrency for payments in ransomware attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIYzlW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 9/17/21 at 4:38PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted that the Treasury Department declined to comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2m4Yzi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
