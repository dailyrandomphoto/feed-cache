    <title>Snapchat’s deal with NBCUniversal brings audio from The Office, SNL, Shrek, and more to your snaps</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfThNe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/nbcuniversal-sounds"&gt;Snapchat’s newly signed deal with NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt; will bring audio from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bridesmaids&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;, and more to the platform (via &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/snapchat-nbcuniversal-audio-snl-1235039596/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Users can add the audio clips to their snaps — just like TikTok — and then send them to their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y16p5l"&gt;Anyone who receives a clip with audio from an NBC title can swipe up to view more information about the content. Tapping the Play This Sound button will show users which streaming services they can use to watch the show or movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2VzER"&gt;Ben Schwerin, Snapchat’s senior vice president of content and partnerships, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;: “NBCUniversal has an iconic catalog and we know Snapchatters will love adding quotes from their favorite movies and series to their Snaps to help perfectly express the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LYAsM"&gt;In October of last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516348/snapchat-snap-sounds-music-ios-update"&gt;Snapchat signed deals with Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt;, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Chappell Music, and more, allowing users to add music to their snaps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;The platform also rolled out a TikTok-like feature called Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users view a vertical stream of short videos. In addition to paying users for creating the most popular Spotlight clips, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711632/snapchat-spotlight-challenges-announced-cash-prizes-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat also entices creators by adding “challenges” that reward users&lt;/a&gt; who apply select Lenses, participate in certain activities, and use specific sounds in their Spotlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFfH8L"&gt;Snapchat’s move to expand its audio offerings is likely in response to TikTok’s growing popularity — as of 2021, TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/"&gt;1 billion users&lt;/a&gt;, compared to Snapchat’s user base of just &lt;a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/snapchat-statistics/"&gt;293 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YF9Noi"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is letting non-Tesla EVs use its Supercharger network for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FiMXAILIt9krzaqDM4XH8AllXPs=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074590/akrales_160419_1019_A_0257.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TedA5q"&gt;Tesla launched a pilot project in the Netherlands this week in which non-Tesla electric vehicles will be allowed to use its Supercharger network, representing the first time that the automaker is opening up its proprietary charging stations to EVs from other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOuMtv"&gt;Tesla’s Supercharger network is often held up as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;best possible example of an EV charging network&lt;/a&gt;: fast, reliable, and plentiful. But Tesla’s network is also exclusive to Tesla owners, meaning someone driving a Volkswagen or Ford EV wouldn’t be able to use it. But that’s now starting to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDaUVr"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/elon-musk-tesla-superchargers-being-used-low-key-other-automakers/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, talked about opening up his company’s vast Supercharger network to other electric vehicles. And over this past summer, he started revealing key details about how it would actually work. Now the company is ready to start the process &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/non-tesla-supercharging"&gt;by announcing its first pilot project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="07ViCR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Tesla will open up its Superchargers to other EVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BM4ItG"&gt;Initially, only 10 Supercharger stations in the Netherlands will be available to non-Tesla EVs. Vehicle owners will need to download the most recent version of Tesla’s smartphone app (version 4.2.3 or higher) in order to access the stations. After downloading the app, customers will be prompted to select “Charge Your Non-Tesla” in order to find the closest participating Supercharger site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmk87"&gt;Tesla owners can still use the stations just as normal. “We will be closely monitoring each site for congestion and listening to customers about their experiences,” the company said in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gw5rEW"&gt;The selection of the Netherlands as the pilot project’s starting location isn’t surprising. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously indicated the experiment would likely start in Europe, where standardized charging cable connectors are mandatory. Other European countries will likely follow before the company opens up its Superchargers in the US. (Tesla has already committed to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/24/tesla-confirms-plan-open-supercharger-network-other-automakers-next-year/"&gt;opening up the network in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qZbyNz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The selection of the Netherlands as the pilot project’s starting location isn’t surprising&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIftvv"&gt;Tesla uses a proprietary connector in North America, so non-Tesla vehicles here will need an adapter in order to access the company’s Superchargers, of which there are over 6,400 plugs in the US, &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC&amp;amp;ev_connectors=TESLA"&gt;according to the Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPKycg"&gt;“It’s always been our ambition to open the Supercharger network to Non-Tesla EVs and, by doing so, encourage more drivers to go electric,” the company said. “This move directly supports our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlnIzw"&gt;There’s still a lot of pieces that need to fall into place before Superchargers across the globe become available to non-Tesla owners, especially with regard to how much other automakers are willing to spend on adapters for their customers. But the pilot in the Netherlands is an indication that the ball is finally rolling on a key piece in Musk’s stated plans to spur a revolution in EV adoption. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Book of Boba Fett’s first trailer teases the spinoff fans have been waiting for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idqoBPPQ0ndehgnSQlsgLCsmbOM=/713x0:3128x1610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074250/06_Boba_Fett_trailer_stills_uhd_t_r709_211010.088651.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAj0WH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; just got its first trailer ahead of its debut on Disney Plus on December 29th, giving an initial look at the upcoming spinoff for the galaxy’s most infamous bounty hunter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5Tcjl"&gt;The spinoff has been a long time coming: Boba Fett has long been one of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars’&lt;/em&gt; most popular characters since his introduction (in the otherwise reviled &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt;). He’s captured the imagination of fans with his action-figure-worthy costume and ice-cold demeanor in &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt;, despite scant minutes of screentime and just four lines of dialogue across the two films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDDypX"&gt;Fett’s character was later expounded upon in subsequent &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; novels, an introductory backstory in the prequels, and eventually, the entire genesis of the fan-favorite Mandalorian culture that’s in turn lead to &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; series. And while there have been rumors for years that Disney was planning to give Boba Fett his own film spinoff, it wasn’t until a post-credit reveal following &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season that the news of the bounty hunter finally getting top billing was revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mlfof8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is set just after that post credit scene, which saw Fett (Temuera Morrison) — aided by fellow bounty hunter Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) — killing Bib Fortuna and reclaiming the palace and territory once held by Jabba the Hutt. The new series appears to follow Fett’s efforts to bring some order to the former crime lord’s holding — presumably without &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many disintegrations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7KrGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; is also just the first of several planned &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs that Disney has in the works for &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBookofBoda110121" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;; the company is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168619/disney-plus-star-wars-rangers-of-the-new-republic-ahsoka-mandalorian-spinoffs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashoka &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Rangers of the New Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will cross over with the original series in the future in a “climactic story event.” That’s in addition to other &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows set to hit the streaming service in the future, including the&lt;em&gt; Rogue One&lt;/em&gt; prequel &lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lando&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Acolyte&lt;/em&gt;, and future seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can buy an orange Apple HomePod Mini now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoAQwXDhfahOw3348hXpCyTavFo=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074127/apple_minis.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini is now available in three new colors — orange, yellow, and blue — in addition to white and space gray. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dctHY3"&gt;You can now &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/homepod-mini-is-available-in-bold-new-colors-starting-today/"&gt;buy Apple’s HomePod Mini in new colors&lt;/a&gt; yellow, orange, and blue (in addition to the standard white and space gray), and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;the $99.99 devices&lt;/a&gt; are available for in-store pickup today. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22723141/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-price-release-date-features"&gt;announced the new colors at its October Unleashed event&lt;/a&gt;, where it unveiled its new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEne8p"&gt;It’s also where Apple announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733053/apple-music-voice-plan-playlists-price-siri"&gt;Apple Music Voice&lt;/a&gt; subscription, a cheaper tier of its music streaming service that you access only via the Siri voice assistant, although there will be a limited app option; it arrives later this year for $4.99 per month and will work with the Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAis36"&gt;The new speakers will have the HomePod mini’s tinted touch surface, fabric mesh, volume icons, and power cable, along with color-matched details. Apple’s competitors already have more colorful options for their small home assistant speakers — Google has blue and orange versions of its Nest Mini speaker, and Amazon’s Echo Dot comes in blue and some animal-themed designs for kids— so it seemed like only a matter of time before Apple caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTbuG8"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod-mini/"&gt;order them from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHomePod-mini-Space-Gray%2F159302133&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-homepod-mini-blue%2F5902427.p%3FskuId%3D5902427&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; with pick-ups available as soon as today and delivery dates available for this week, in Canada, Mexico, and the US. In China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan orders are also opening today, while availability is listed as “later this month” for Australia, Austria, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luigi’s Mansion expansion sets join Lego’s Super Mario World collection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Luigi’s Mansion Lego set" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KGMPU95XSPaz7BSEDRd31h-Thkk=/0x1:1440x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074187/lego_luigis_mansion_mario.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qZC6Fe"&gt;Just months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393486/luigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course"&gt;Luigi joined Lego’s interactive Super Mario World collection&lt;/a&gt;, Lego has announced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2021%2Foctober%2FLEGO-Super-Mario-Luigis-Mansion-Sets&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F1%2F22756073%2Fluigis-mansion-expansion-sets-legos-super-mario-world-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; expansion sets&lt;/a&gt; that give the green-clad plumber the attention he deserves (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-luigis-mansion-set-110023202.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). With the $30 Lab and Poltergust set, you can equip Luigi with a Poltergust and use it to capture the Gold Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vl6upD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuGsLRNS5VI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxUW2O"&gt;The $40 Mansion Entry set lets you step into a haunted mansion, where you’ll encounter Boo as you grab the Golden Bone for Polterpup. Finally, the $80 Haunt-and-Seek set offers an experience that’s just like the &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; game — build and wander through a series of rotating hallways filled with ghosts and hidden gems to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2Xcrk"&gt;You can attach all three sets for the ultimate ghost-hunting experience, or use each one separately. And although Lego announced the &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; set on Halloween, it won’t hit the stores until January 1st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DCp8f"&gt;Just keep in mind that Luigi actually isn’t included in any of these sets, so you’ll need a Luigi or Mario Starter Course to get started. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Building-Collectible-Creative/dp/B08YPBBRR5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luigi Starter Course&lt;/a&gt; is currently $60, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Building-Interactive-Featuring/dp/B085878WLK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mario Starter Course&lt;/a&gt; is on sale right now for $47.99 on Amazon, down from $60. You can expect to spend $150 for the entire &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; set or a total of $210 if you decide to add the Luigi Starter Course.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats announces Fit Pro earbuds with wing tip design and $200 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ocF-gwmGtLrClQFPhiePrHWRSns=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074042/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaG4LB"&gt;Beats today announced its latest wireless earbuds, the $199.99 Beats Fit Pro. The new product slots into the Apple-owned brand’s lineup between the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt;, which were released earlier this year, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt;. The Fit Pros have active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and up to seven hours of continuous playback (or 30 hours of total listening when you include case recharges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpgqYB"&gt;The most noticeable thing about the new earbuds are the wing tips that are a permanent part of their design. Beats says it did a ton of research and user testing to land on the right material and level of flexibility. The wing tips are intended to help the Fit Pros stay locked in your ears no matter how strenuous your workout routine might be.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have flexible, removable wing tips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tidHHI"&gt;Unlike the Studio Buds, which lacked Apple’s usual silicon inside, the Fit Pro buds include the H1 chip and thus come with the entire suite of features like one-step pairing, automatic syncing across your iCloud devices, auto switching between Apple hardware products, and more. They also include dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, and Beats even integrated the brand-new skin detect sensor that only just debuted on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;third-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iHlMY1"&gt;The noise cancellation system is essentially the same as what’s on the AirPods Pro, so it should prove rather effective at quieting the outside world. When ANC and transparency mode are both off, the Fit Pro buds still use Apple’s Adaptive EQ to optimize audio performance based on your particular ear shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIOOFO"&gt;Beats will offer the Fit Pro earbuds in four colors: black, white, gray, and purple / pink. Preorders start today and they ship on November 5th. You don’t need to wait long to read the verdict on the latest Beats buds: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22517199"&gt;I’ve been testing them for several days now&lt;/a&gt; and have found that they’re the company’s best, most focused product since the Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Fit Pro review: sporty AirPod Pros with better sound</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The latest Beats earbuds are the company’s best product since the Powerbeats Pro&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nDxaBa"&gt;Beats has been busy. After releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, today the Apple-owned brand is back with the more premium Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds. It’s unusual to see two completely new products from Beats in a single year, but perhaps the company is trying to make a point that it’s not idly sitting by and playing second fiddle to Apple’s AirPods and AirPods Pro. If anything, the $200 Fit Pros demonstrate that Beats has found its focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O44goa"&gt;The Fit Pros are a wonderfully designed pair of earbuds that integrate the best of Apple tech. They’ve got active noise cancellation that’s on par with the AirPods Pro. The same spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. The same Adaptive EQ. They even have the brand-new skin detect sensor that only just debuted in the third-generation AirPods. There’ve been many questions about where Beats fits into Apple’s long-term plans, and while a single product can’t really provide an answer to that, the Fit Pros are solid evidence that this brand isn’t being pushed to the wayside anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8cPj7p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10835161"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VQ9YjT"&gt;When I reviewed the Studio Buds, I praised their ambition and Beats’ attempt to cater to Android users as much as iPhone owners. But despite their great comfort, good sound, and compact design, those earbuds had some key missing features and fell a bit flat on execution. Not so with the Beats Fit Pros. They’re exactly what you’d want them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXEoWH"&gt;These are the best earbuds Beats has ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ro362AyFIV-Gne_F-Aom3OwEGKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973215/DSCF6033_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro earbuds have a permanent wing tip as part of their design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iFJoD"&gt;As Beats explains it, the Fit Pros are meant to fill a gap in its lineup between the Studio Buds and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181088/beats-powerbeats-4-2020-review-wireless-earbuds-fitness-specs-price"&gt;Powerbeats&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Their wing tips make them more gym-ready than the Studio Buds, but they don’t go as far as including the Powerbeats’ signature hooks that wrap around your ears. I have marathon runner friends who swear by the ear hooks and say nothing comes close to that stability for vigorous activity. But Beats thinks it has found a great alternative with the Fit Pros — all in a design that’s much more compact, lightweight, and comfortable than the Powerbeats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8gtNz"&gt;The Fit Pros come in a case that’s basically a miniaturized version of the Powerbeats Pro case. Just as with those, there’s no wireless charging — a very frustrating omission at this price — but the case at least uses USB-C instead of Lightning. A longstanding gripe with the Powerbeats Pro is they can be finicky with charging unless you place them in the case just right. Their ear hooks make it easy to get this wrong, and on many occasions I’ve gone to use them only to find one earbud fully charged and the other completely drained. I’m happy to say this isn’t something you need to fret about with the Fit Pros: each earbud drops into its cradle with a reassuring magnetic pull and I’ve experienced zero charging mishaps. The lid has a little more play than I’d like, but I can be nitpicky about that sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we1gy2"&gt;As for the buds themselves, they’ve got a unique look thanks to their permanent, curved wing tips. Beats is selling them in black, gray, white, and a pinkish purple. The gray and purple have gotten the best feedback among &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff. At 5.6 grams per earbud, they weigh in slightly heavier than the AirPods Pro but lighter than some fitness-geared buds like the Jaybird Vista 2s. The new Jabra Elite 7 Active buds are a hair lighter at 5.5 grams. Regardless, the Beats are extremely comfortable and also have microventing to alleviate ear pressure buildup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5cfhDDBbzE9rbvau1NyEFEQBC4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973216/DSCF6032_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re designed for a secure, stable fit during active use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfmCQi"&gt;Beats is very proud of how much it crammed into the Fit Pros, which have the company’s smallest enclosure yet — not counting the wing tips, obviously. They contain 30 percent more components than the Studio Buds and the transducer is 15 percent larger. Three sizes of silicone ear tips come in the box, along with a short USB-C cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwNfcA"&gt;But what about those wing tips? They’re meant to help the earbuds stay put. But I’ve found that on some earbuds, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMKgWMO3fu8"&gt;the second-gen Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt;, these wing tips and numbs can cause discomfort the longer you wear them, so there’s definitely a risk in Beats making them a permanent part of the design. But the company says it sweated the details over the wing’s shape and material. And after several days spent testing the Fit Pros — often for several hours at a time — I haven’t noticed any soreness. The wing tip is flexible and pliable enough that it doesn’t press into the concha of your ear in an annoying way. You’ll feel it there during extended listening, don’t get me wrong, but at most it produces a little itchiness instead of more serious irritation. And you can alleviate that just by adjusting the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rqULYd7Vneck60NRlyx1aucD5Hc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973267/DSCF6021_Edited_2.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case disappointingly lacks wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Syd1jUW8K0nbniLo10_UbyMk_2o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973219/DSCF6026_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it’s much smaller and more pocketable than the Powerbeats Pro case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S5XkUB"&gt;Beats says it designed the wing tips for “every ear imaginable,” but ears are all different, and there will always be exceptions. That said, I let several people try the Fit Pros and even those with small ears could find a way to make the wing tip work for them and said it resulted in a more steady overall fit. They passed the gym test and didn’t come even slightly loose during high intensity runs. They also stayed in while eating, something that’s a challenge for many earbuds. The Fit Pros are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, which is adequate for workout purposes, but below the IP57 of Jabra’s latest active buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbL4uu"&gt;Like the Studio Buds, these have a nice and clicky “b” button on each earbud with the usual control scheme: press once to play / pause / answer call, twice to skip to the next track, and three times to go back. But there’s one interesting tidbit: for the first time, you can remap a long press to adjust volume instead of toggling noise cancellation or summoning Siri. This can be done right in the iOS settings menu and is something that the AirPods Pro can’t do, nor can the Beats Studio Buds. I like having the option, even if I ended up sticking with the defaults. Bring that remapping capability to your other earbuds, Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88pUIZ"&gt;Beats has outfitted its latest earbuds with 9.5mm drivers, and they produce very satisfying sound quality that I’d rank above the AirPods Pro. This isn’t the bloated bass Beats of old: the company shed that reputation quite a long time ago. The Fit Pro buds might have slightly less overall boom and oomph than the Powerbeats Pros, in fact, but switching back and forth between the two, it was close — and I preferred the more refined sound of the newer buds. If there’s one weakness I’ve noticed, it’s maximum volume. The Fit Pros seem to have a lower volume ceiling than some of their competitors, so if you tend to crank things up for motivation during a run or fitness routine, you might be underwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptNyqVVjvt3IM3On3kkY-q2tLvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973260/DSCF6027_Edited.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fit Pros also come in black or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5DKkh"&gt;Unlike the Studio Buds, which didn’t have Apple’s usual earbud chipset inside, the Fit Pros have the H1 and all the features that come along with that. The main benefits are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SUW64G"&gt;Dynamic head tracking for spatial audio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7PiN2B"&gt;Automatic device switching between iPhone, iPad, and Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ks3YKH"&gt;Automatic syncing with all of your iCloud devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JVHpWj"&gt;Audio sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B1kp8M"&gt;Find My integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ek848h"&gt;Hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JFeJdA"&gt;Beats notes that a lot of other functionality — ANC, transparency mode, one-step setup, Apple Music spatial audio (minus head tracking) — works just as well on Android as on iOS. You’ll need the Beats app for some things like control customization and more detailed battery status. The Studio Buds supported Android’s native Fast Pair feature, but the Fit Pros do not. That’s not surprising considering there’s once again Apple silicon inside. But it means that there’s an extra layer of seamlessness when using the Fit Pros within Apple’s ecosystem. You can get most of the way there on Android, but not quite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LodQQX"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the Fit Pros essentially have the same noise cancellation system as the AirPods Pro — also powered by the H1 chip. Performance between the two is more or less identical, and transparency mode sounds natural here in the same way it does on the Pros (with the same sound effects as you switch between modes). When ANC is off, Beats refers to this as “Adaptive EQ” mode. That’s where you’ll get the best battery life: seven hours of continuous playback and up to 30 hours including case recharges. Using ANC or transparency drops those figures to six hours and 27 hours, respectively, so you’re not losing much no matter how you’re using the buds. Beats says you’ll get an hour of playback (with ANC) from a quick five-minute top off, and fully recharging both earbuds and the case takes around 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwSNeI81-knRJSxigKLlbqVaLcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22973283/DSCF6031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wing tips rarely cause any discomfort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zeFH6b"&gt;The Fit Pro buds also include Apple’s new skin detect sensor, first seen in the latest AirPods, for more accurate automatic play / pause when removed from your ears. This sensor can tell the difference between skin and other tight confines like pant pockets, so the earbuds are less likely to resume playing when you don’t want them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0axW5"&gt;Voice call performance is quite good but falls short of the AirPods. If you’re wearing one of the earbuds alone, three mics are used for voice calls. When both earbuds are in use, the voice system leverages five mics. The Fit Pros utilize beamforming mics and voice detection algorithms to help isolate your voice from background commotion. My co-workers heard me loud and clear on Zoom calls, and people I chatted with on the phone said I sounded fine, if slightly less pronounced as when using the AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="8auFU5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10838399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ggRvHJ"&gt;The Fit Pros successfully thread the needle between everyday and fitness-focused earbuds. They’re objectively a better choice than the AirPods Pro for workouts and running, and they handle more casual listening equally as well. They improve upon the lackluster noise cancellation that dragged down the Studio Buds, and they restore Apple’s full arsenal of ecosystem tricks. They also bring back features that Beats left out last time like in-ear detection. Making wing tips part of the core design was a gamble, and there will no doubt be cases where that decision causes issues for some people. All I can say is these are among the most comfortable wing tips I’ve ever had in my ears — and they succeed at their purpose of keeping the Fit Pros locked in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ink9Ul"&gt;If you already own a set of AirPods or bought the Studio Buds earlier this year, these aren’t a must have. But if you’ve been searching for something worthy of replacing your Powerbeats Pro, the Beats Fit Pro might just be the ticket. They’re the sporty AirPod Pros a lot of people have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iPhone’s location tracking </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leEXkTb0hpgtXR8qvSk-3L4t47o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69871891/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeBzxN"&gt;Your iPhone uses information from your cell service, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to pinpoint its location, and since you almost always have your phone on you, your location as well. That information can be useful for a lot of things, such as letting others know where you are or finding your phone when it’s lost. Other times, it’s just more data that services and companies collect about you, creating privacy concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2rbnr"&gt;The good news is you can tighten your controls so that apps are only accessing your location when it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGeN94"&gt;Toggling your location settings can differ from phone to phone, depending on what model of iPhone you have and what version of iOS it’s running. The following directions were tested on an iPhone 11 running iOS 15; if you’re running a different version of iOS, there shouldn’t be much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nJYdGZ"&gt;Turn off location access for specific apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2bachq"&gt;Location data is useful for some apps (for example, if you want to order food) and necessary for others, like maps or ride-shares. However, if an app asks for your location and you don’t feel it needs the data, you can disable location services for that app. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="10QMkI"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yjxmeM"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XXWXWw"&gt;“Location Services” will most likely be switched on. Unless you want to completely cut all location services off (see below), leave it alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwmyHl"&gt;Scroll down to find a list of all the apps that enable location services. Each listing will show the app’s name and the type of permission it has: “Never,” “When Shared,” or “While Using.” “When Shared” refers to the option “Ask Next Time Or When I Share.” Meanwhile, “While Using” will usually mean “While using the App,” but it can sometimes also refer to “While Using the App or Widgets.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APxPyw"&gt;If you want to change a specific app’s access to your location data, click on the app listing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can adjust location services for specific apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSpH0kbFBBPq3Pdd52RfatmGL9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857412/IMG_13B4445EF110_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can adjust location services for specific apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How you can allow location access depends on the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BpBbvHInOumIiH0y2cORf5Nv3bw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857413/IMG_6D2F84330D37_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How you can allow location access depends on the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0xJQiW"&gt;If you click “While Using the App,” then that app will have access to your location either when it’s open or when it’s in use in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4mvxq"&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services” at the bottom of the “Location Services” screen. Here, you can toggle location access for a number of things, including Wi-Fi, time zone, emergency calls, and Apple News and App Store ads that are relevant to your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YugSqN"&gt;To the left of some of the service toggles, you may see a small arrow. A hollow arrow means the item may have access to your location under certain conditions; a purple arrow means the item has recently used your location, while a gray arrow means it used your location sometime in the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more ways to limit location access, click on “System Services.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Arrows show which apps are accessing your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0NqNW6ZvUftQBR3XzifVQDNuOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857582/IMG_4283119948D6_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrows show which apps are accessing your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9PkYM"&gt;To check whether your phone is still collecting location data, go down to the very bottom of the “System Services” screen and toggle the switch on for “Status Bar Icon.” This will display an arrow at the top of your screen when an app on your phone is accessing your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvTXrC"&gt;If you want to truly go off the grid, you can disable location services to prevent your phone from collecting any location data at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r8HSiU"&gt;Open Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hknF2h"&gt;Go to “Privacy” &amp;gt; “Location Services.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4s36Y6"&gt;Toggle the “Location Services” switch to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="affITu"&gt;You’ll get a notice telling you that, while Location Services will be disabled for all apps, it will temporarily come online if you use the “Find My iPhone” and report your phone lost. Select “Turn Off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CcJJeH"&gt;If you have an iPhone 11 or later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NSGXGW"&gt;If you have a phone designed with Apple’s U1 chip — such as an iPhone 11 or later — and have disabled location services for specific apps, you may find that you still sometimes see the arrow. According to Apple, this is because these models &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997338/apple-ultra-wideband-u1-chip-iphone-11-pro-location-data-request-privacy-issue"&gt;use ultra wideband technology&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple says is regulated, so the phones use location services to determine if they’re in an area where ultra wideband use is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwciFf"&gt;The iPhone requests location data when location preferences are set on an app-per-app basis, so switching off location services for your phone overall will stop these location requests since your phone won’t be able to collect any location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0BmHZV"&gt;Share your location with individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AvJ5VO"&gt;If you’re walking alone at night or you’re in an Uber by yourself, you might want a friend or family member to know your location in real time. If you have iOS 13 or later, you can use the Find My app to share your location with family and friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yd7T8R"&gt;Open “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qRKhHK"&gt;Go into “Privacy,” and make sure “Location Services” is switched on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZS7j0A"&gt;Go back to the main “Settings” menu and tap on your name at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wO93M2"&gt;Select “Find My.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ADpOmK"&gt;Toggle “Share My Location” so that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aajRcv"&gt;Then go to the Find My app. If this is your first time using the app, it will ask you whether you want it to access your location. Choose either to “Allow While Using App,” “Allow Once,” or “Don’t Allow.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EP4LB6"&gt;You may get a screen explaining that “Find My” can be used with an AirTag or for AirPods, and that there are apps for the watchOS as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C2oZkD"&gt;On the map screen that appears, select “People” at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TJymR1"&gt;Click the button that says “Start Sharing Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="poO8DJ"&gt;In the “To:” field, type in either the phone number or name of your friend or family member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MMwj9E"&gt;If the person you select has a phone number that isn’t associated with an iPhone, you’ll be notified with a pop-up. (But you can still share your location.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v9RYlu"&gt;Tap “Send,” then select either “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Find My app lets you share your location." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoCeKInZlvEqdEYDXrfO3-0j4qs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857616/IMG_425BFDC7C40D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Find My app lets you share your location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDV8vATBkeqsU6AiIwFDxv73JN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22857538/IMG_80499A0AC888_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Start Sharing Location” and choose whom you want to share it with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLskUW"&gt;It will then start sharing your location. In order to switch it off, click on your contact’s name in the “Find My” app under “People,” then tap “Stop Sharing My Location.” Confirm by clicking on the “Stop Sharing Location” button that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaDFmh"&gt;(Note: For some reason, the “Share Until End of Day” selection seems to always select midnight Pacific Time rather than the end of day local time. For example, I’m on Eastern Time, and so “end of day” is always somewhere around 3AM. I’ve reached out to Apple to find out if they have a fix for this and will let you know if / when I hear back.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YX8aIT"&gt;Send recurring notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="alLgD7"&gt;You can have your phone send out recurring notifications as well. These are useful if you want your friend or relative to know when a you get to a location (or don’t get there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4aqISQ"&gt;In the “Find My” app, tap the “People” tab at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ikQYZL"&gt;Select the person you want to send notifications to (it should be somebody you’re already sharing your location with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Oj16lY"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Notifications” and tab “Add.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4QBnWx"&gt;A pop-up from the bottom will give you the option to notify that person. Select it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TzQf1e"&gt;You can notify the person when you arrive at or leave a specific location, and send the notification just once or every time you arrive or leave (for example, if you want to let somebody know every day when you get home from work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KY2bKD"&gt;Share via Messages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uB02dt"&gt;You can share your location through Messages as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LrbY2N"&gt;Open a conversation in Messages. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VCb4XE"&gt;Tap on the contact name and then click “Info.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="25EDCT"&gt;This will give you the option to “Share My Location,” which will give you the option to “Share for One Hour,” “Share Until End of Day,” or “Share Indefinitely.” Click one of those to start sharing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScUruo"&gt;If you want to stop sharing, click “Stop Sharing My Location” where “Share My Location” was. A button labeled “Stop Sharing My Location” will pop up. Click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="KqQCyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 17th, 2021, 10:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on December 12th, 2019, and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Nest Audio speaker is almost half off this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M6NK2LtBfVPLLOnIpR4XxGzB1-c=/0x0:5248x3499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70074002/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="snbctc"&gt;November 1st has brought on a huge wave of great tech deals, perhaps as a sign of even greater things to come later in the month with Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google has marked down many of its latest Nest smart home and audio devices to their all-time low prices, and generally, good deals can be had on a multitude of devices from other companies, including Eero, Sony, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6KSkJ"&gt;The most eye-popping deal of the day is on Google’s Nest Audio smart speaker. This cloth-covered device is Google’s latest model, and normally it costs $99.99. We’ve seen it drop by around $20 before, but this week’s $40 price drop is unprecedented. At $60, it outperforms other smart speakers in that price range, which normally includes devices like Amazon’s Echo Dot (fourth gen) and Google’s own Nest Mini when they aren’t on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woA6Az"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert praised the Nest Audio&lt;/a&gt; for being a marked improvement over the original Google Home in every way. It touts improved audio quality, it’s faster at registering Google Assistant queries, and you can easily pair two of them together for stereo sound. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N3nOww"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYp6Yc"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro that include a new MagSafe charging case were $30 off the original $249 price all of last week, and now the price has gotten better. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUupipgHTH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering them for $60 off the original price, currently sitting at $190. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-84852592%3Fpreselect%3D77603773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is now offering them for just $200. Mind you, that’s still a little pricey compared to the previous iteration’s usual price of around $180, which didn’t include the MagSafe compatibility. But, if you were holding steady until a discount brought them below the $200 mark, today might be the day you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UwyMEc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10826178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xu8tWIDEQTfBV5nSOzNZd_RsNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399100/dseifert_20210323_4485_0001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rzws1p"&gt;Continuing with Google’s streak of excellent deals, the second-generation Nest Hub that can offer sleep tracking by way of its Soli radar sensor is just $50, down from $100. This is the biggest price drop yet on the newer model, and like the Nest Audio, you can find this deal at a few retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUtxztgIkl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-2nd-gen-smart-display%2F-%2FA-82678346%3Fpreselect%3D79796810%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-2nd-Gen-Smart-Home-Display-with-Google-Assistant-Chalk%2F169438279&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup11012021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvwPxl"&gt;The second-gen Nest Hub is just as good at serving as a digital photo frame as the first-gen model, thanks to its ambient display that’s always bright enough, yet never too bright. Its sleep tracking feature is interesting, and it works just about as well as a Fitbit Inspire HR, according to Dan Seifert’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6N7XWu"&gt;You just place it on your nightstand about an arm’s length or less away from your bed, and point the screen towards where you sleep. Its radar sensors are sensitive enough to track your breathing and movement, so the Nest Hub can tell when you’re moving, when you’ve fallen asleep, and when you’ve woken up. Its microphone records how often you cough and snore during the night, which might put an end to many spousal arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="u8JgSC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8vsnMN"&gt;Stay tuned for later in the day when we’ll post several more deals that Google is hosting this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbUDEB"&gt;If you’re into video chatting, Facebook’s 10-inch Portal smart display that can follow your movements with its Smart Camera feature is just $79, matching the price of the smaller &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Portal-Facebook-Hands-Free-Calling-Built-pc/dp/B07XY7HL93/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight-inch Portal Mini&lt;/a&gt;. The Portal looks like a photo frame when it’s not in use, and you can also use it with apps like Zoom, Plex, Spotify, and more. In terms of smart assistants, it has Alexa integration. This Portal display has a switch on its top that lets you toggle its camera and microphone to off. It’s available at this price in white or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HTTlY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10594754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6YTReK"&gt;Other deals you might be interested in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BJqEz"&gt;Usually $400, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/dp/B07XPDYRRJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a two-pack of Eero Pro 6 tri-band mesh Wi-Fi routers&lt;/a&gt; with Zigbee are just $299 at Amazon (previous best deal was at $320). If you just want one of them, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085VNCZHL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $171&lt;/a&gt;, down from $229.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UtIZ6V"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-256GB-Camera-Solor/dp/B08B9SGGRS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Motorola Edge is $400 at Amazon today&lt;/a&gt;. The phone released in 2020 and features a 6.7-inch OLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 765 chipset, 6GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. It’s compatible with all carriers via 4G and with 5G on T-Mobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P9MiR2"&gt;The excellent Logitech G502 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-PowerPlay-Compatible-Lightsync/dp/B07L4BM851?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (originally $150). Despite having tested dozens of other mice since it released in 2019, I still think this is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; you can buy if you have the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1nguU3"&gt;Sony’s stellar WH-1000XM4 over-ear, wireless headphones are back down to their lowest price yet. You can snag them for $248 (originally $350) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUubRmTcIr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
