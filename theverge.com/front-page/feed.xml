    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k5oMWW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22372016%2Fapple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is officially opening up&lt;/a&gt; its Find My tracking network to third-party companies (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;as it had promised last year&lt;/a&gt;.) Now, any hardware manufacturer can add software-side support for Apple’s localized network to track missing items — so long as they play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3KKTk"&gt;The first wave of items that can now be tracked starting today include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s S3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;X3 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, and the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag — all of which can now rely on Apple’s crowdsourced Bluetooth network (which encompasses millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBlSj"&gt;Users will be able to add those devices to the updated Find My app starting today and can track them through that app much in the same way that they’d track any missing Apple product. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRWl47qcc_MooRKhCYbIzv0ePy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427260/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chipolo’s Find My-compatible One Spot tracker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HAu2KR"&gt;Apple says that third-party devices looking to add support will have to apply through the company’s MFi program for authorized accessories and “adhere to all the privacy protections of the Find My network that Apple customers rely on.” Approved products will sport a new “Works with Apple Find My” badge to let customers know that they’re compatible with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oc3g2t"&gt;Additionally, Apple announced that it’d be offering a chipset specification for third-party hardware companies to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband systems in Apple’s more recent phones for even more precise tracking in the future. Apple has also long been rumored to be working on its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529927/apple-airtags-location-tracker-find-my-accessory-patent-applications-posture"&gt;AirTags product&lt;/a&gt;, which would offer similar UWB-based tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI Prestige 14 Evo review: fast but flawed</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Good isn’t quite good enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="X4bbCc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136283/msi-prestige-14-review-laptop-specs-price-pink-content-creator"&gt;MSI’s Prestige 14&lt;/a&gt; laptop line is traditionally marketed to content creators. But the Prestige 14 Evo is in a bit of a murkier spot. It’s priced below the Prestige 14, starting at $1,099, and it doesn’t have the discrete GPU or high-resolution screen that would render it a compelling content-creation machine. Despite its name, the Prestige 14 Evo is an everyday productivity laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL85H2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10430763"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H1UNnX"&gt;Unfortunately, that makes it a tougher sell. The 14-inch consumer laptop space at this price point is absolutely stuffed; there are multiple machines at comparable prices that do just about everything very, very well. A laptop with even one significant drawback is going to have trouble rising to the top of the pack. Unfortunately, the Prestige 14 Evo has a number of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZI4UC"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s nothing exceptional about the device. The Prestige is one of the few 14-inch laptops you can buy that includes the Core i7-1185G7, Intel’s most powerful chip for ultraportables. This review is my first look at the flagship processor (outside of a reference design that I had for a few days last year) — most of the top laptops that I’ve reviewed recently include the Core i7-1165G7, which is a step down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T8uP9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo is one of the most powerful 14-inch Intel laptops you can buy at its price point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDj0Gw"&gt;That undoubtedly makes the Prestige 14 Evo one of the most powerful 14-inch Intel laptops you can buy at its price point. But does the 1185G7 offer significantly better performance than other Intel systems, or Apple’s M1 MacBooks, to outweigh shortcomings in the chassis? For the majority of users, the answer is going to be no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyuzKK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22327287/msi-summit-series-b15-review-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSI Summit B15 review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136283/msi-prestige-14-review-laptop-specs-price-pink-content-creator"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSI Prestige 14 review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Prestige 14 Evo from the front, open. The screen displays The Verge homepage. A mug is on its right and a ball and a mason jar half filled with water are on its left. In the background are plants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M-tJ3UkHy228Njiot5WABpPOhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395382/akrales_20210323_4482_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is from the front.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RYGspV"&gt;If you’ve seen or used last year’s Prestige 14, the chassis isn’t massively different. The Evo has the same lightweight build with a fold-under hinge, a fingerprint sensor in the top-left corner of the touchpad, and a decent keyboard that’s plasticky but comfortable overall. My model is “carbon gray,” but the finish also comes in “rose pink” and “pure white.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YIbP2"&gt;One update you’ll probably notice is that there’s a new logo. MSI’s classic dragon has been confined to its gaming models; the Prestige now has the same plain-old MSI letters as the business-chic Summit Series. The ports have also been rearranged. The Evo includes two USB-C ports on the left as well as a USB-A, a microSD, and a headphone jack on the right; last year’s Prestige had the microSD on the left and an additional USB-A on the right. I’m sad to lose the additional USB-A (and the one that’s there is only USB 2.0, which is an old standard at this point), but it’s an okay port selection either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back right corner of the MSI Prestige 14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8IiNKXJVGylPZaMCxEfLr9nJzI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395390/akrales_20210323_4482_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chassis has a touch of blue around the edges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Prestige 14 Evo keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/odRgM1InLV-yVcoCbj7JCfi7gtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395392/akrales_20210323_4482_0183.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not visible here, but the keyboard’s backlit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1FVEjT"&gt;I have several issues with the chassis, though. First, it’s quite a fingerprint magnet, and the lid was covered in visible smudges after just a few days of use. It also has a bit of a plasticky feel, with some flex in both the screen and the deck. Second, not only does the 1920 x 1080 display have a cramped 16:9 aspect ratio, but it’s also dim, maxing out at 248 nits in my testing. That means it won’t be a great choice for use outdoors or in other bright settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdBtZX"&gt;Third, the touchpad had some palm-rejection issues: my right hand rested naturally on the right half of the touchpad while I was typing, and the cursor was constantly jumping around on my screen. (MSI says they haven’t heard this complaint about the Evo’s touchpad before.) Finally, the audio isn’t great — it’s tinny, bass is almost nonexistent, and there’s not enough volume to fill a room. You can check out my review of last year’s Prestige 14 for a more in-depth discussion of all these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="FuWwkW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have several issues with the chassis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI logo on the bottom bezel of the MSI Prestige 14 Evo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4k8Wiw3EljHmKfbDxqmmZJdhpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395387/akrales_20210323_4482_0092.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI debuted its new logo this past year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the MSI Prestige 14 Evo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FoT9x6PsH7SgajbHGv6-ocngdRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395386/akrales_20210323_4482_0080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my favorite location for a fingerprint sensor, as a righty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="REdaGa"&gt;The biggest upgrades are on the inside — the Evo is powered by Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors. The base Prestige 14 includes a Core i5-1135G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. (RAM is soldered and there aren’t extra storage slots, but you can swap out the SSD.) The $1,149 model I’m using bumps that up to a Core i7-1185G7. Both processors come with Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIrCfE"&gt;Setting aside the chassis, $1,149 is an okay deal for that system. For price comparisons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Zenbook 14&lt;/a&gt; with 512GB of storage, a Core i7-1165G7, and 8GB of RAM is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Ultra-Slim-i7-1065G7-Thunderbolt-UX425JA-EB71/dp/B08KH9SX3G?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$899.99&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air%2Fspace-gray-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22368806%2Fmsi-prestige-14-evo-review-price-specs-features-intel-1185g7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is $1,449 for the same specs. If you want something with a GPU, the regular Prestige 14 with a GTX 1650 Max-Q and 1TB of storage is $1,549.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0sMK6"&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo is certified through Intel’s Evo platform, which means Intel has verified that it meets a number of performance benchmarks (including “all-day” battery life and one-second boot time) and includes modern amenities like Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Prestige 14 Evo keyboard from the left side seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s29bJVQSuPNJ-zQsVBmPJ89oVCE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395391/akrales_20210323_4482_0137.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some models come bundled with a sleeve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VaCHRh"&gt;The 1185G7 did a fine job with my standard workload of apps, dozens of Chrome tabs, Zoom calls, light photo editing, and the like. I never had to think twice about loading more tasks on — not only did the fans not freak out during my regular workday, but I never even heard them spin up. (I did occasionally hear some coil whine, which was annoying.) The keyboard and the bottom of the chassis remained cool as well. The experience was pretty comparable to that of using an M1 Macbook Air or any other top ultraportable as a daily driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3r3d1"&gt;To more directly compare the 1185G7 to other chips (primarily Apple’s M1), I ran a number of synthetic benchmarks. The results were a mixed bag — you can see them in the chart below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5uMXZF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10430868"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P448eu"&gt;In our testing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; beat the Prestige 14 Evo on every benchmark here except for Geekbench 5.3 OpenCL / Compute and the 30-minute Cinebench loop (which makes sense, since the MacBook Air doesn’t have a fan). It’s particularly notable that the 1185G7 loses to the M1 on both single-core benchmarks; single-core performance is typically Intel’s strength, but not here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the MSI Prestige 14 Evo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HTm9y2YmPDpYxaK7YFcSyaLsi0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395389/akrales_20210323_4482_0103.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One USB 2.0 Type-A, one microSD card reader, and one combination audio jack on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the MSI Prestige 14 Evo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9M9V3cD02cSHDUwHOuPZa6Hz9cw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395388/akrales_20210323_4482_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Prestige 14 Evo laid out flat, seen from the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-w1OQZZa40N5Bghwk6CyohtpP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395385/akrales_20210323_4482_0067.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fold-under hinge lifts the deck a bit off the table.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="osboW9"&gt;I also put the Prestige 14 Evo through two demanding real-world tasks: the &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; benchmark and a five-minute, 33-second 4K video export in Premiere Pro. The Evo’s results here were quite comparable to those of the MacBook Air. The Evo ran &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; (lowest settings, native resolution) at 38fps, which is identical to what the Air got in our testing. The Asus Zenbook 14 with a Core i7-1165G7 put up 29fps on the same title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3ESwq"&gt;The Prestige completed the export in eight minutes and nine seconds. That’s the fastest time I’ve ever seen from a mass-production Iris Xe machine; the Zenbook took 11 minutes and 28 seconds. That said, it’s literally only a few seconds faster than the MacBook Air, which clocked in at eight minutes and 15 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RtfHBa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 1185G7 is a clear improvement over lower-clocked Tiger Lake chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELgLAv"&gt;Overall, the 1185G7 is a clear improvement over lower-clocked Tiger Lake chips (but the 1165G7 is good enough that you likely won’t notice the difference outside of demanding tasks). Its integrated graphics seem to be neck and neck with those of the M1. (Intel’s Quick Sync is also likely a factor in that speedy export time.) But the synthetic benchmarks, which are more of a rough approximation of CPU capability, indicate that the Prestige might fall behind on other tasks, depending on your workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ2Gjt"&gt;I did see some battery drain during the export, despite the laptop being plugged in. It turns out that the Prestige comes with overcharge protection that keeps it from charging if it’s plugged in above a certain percentage. You can swap between battery-capacity profiles in MSI’s Center for Business and Productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfV5l3"&gt;The laptop seemed to struggle to cool the chip, as did last year’s Prestige 14 (though that model also had a discrete GPU to worry about). Throughout all of my testing, the CPU was consistently in the mid-90s (Celsius) — and that was with the fans audibly blasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drlIJu"&gt;Battery life is okay, but not the best. I averaged six hours and 12 minutes of continuous sustained work, with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. That’s not a disaster, but it’s only a bit ahead of the previous Prestige 14, which had discrete graphics and a smaller battery. (I got about six hours, with the same workload, out of that machine.) And it’s significantly worse than the MacBook Air, which gave my colleague Dieter Bohn up to 10 hours to a charge. I even got over an hour more out of the Zenbook 14. Compared to both systems, that’s a heck of a lot of battery life to give up for a nonexistent-to-small gain in real-world performance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Prestige 14 Evo open, seen from the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjcH-wUiYMMF5YcMuKxvpGRk1wI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395383/akrales_20210323_4482_0043.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo weighs 2.84 pounds and is 0.63 inches thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p3X9Dq"&gt;Finally, the Prestige comes preloaded with some junk, including Norton, which sent me annoying pop-ups until I uninstalled it. This isn’t the end of the world, but it’s still a bit irritating to see on a laptop that costs over $1,000. I also found MSI’s Center for Business and Productivity to be a bit of a pain to use — my clicks were somewhat slow to register, and the software occasionally froze or crashed. (It does have useful features, though, including the Application Optimizer which allows you to manually distribute CPU power between programs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpTnHI"&gt;The Prestige 14 Evo is a functional, portable device with a heck of a processor inside. It’s always impressive to see so much power in such a thin chassis. That said, the Evo doesn’t seem quite ready to accommodate the chip, or the demanding tasks that you might want to do if you’re looking for a 1185G7. It’s able to game, and it’s able to export, but I can tell that the fans are struggling to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4nhky"&gt;For that reason, I have trouble seeing a case for the Prestige 14 Evo over competitors. The laptop is fine, functional, and impressive on the inside — but from the dim screen and outdated port to the thin audio and coil whine, there are too many compromises for which a hefty chip has to make up. For the majority of laptop buyers who don’t need a slightly better screen or discrete graphics, more affordable 1165G7 systems like the Zenbook 14 come without these kinks but with better battery life and close to the same performance and portability benefits. If you’re willing to pay just a bit more, the MacBook Air performs just as well if not better in most tasks and is a significant step up in almost every other area. The Prestige 14 Evo is in a weird place in the middle, and it doesn’t quite fit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gimlet and Ringer unions detail their first historic contracts with Spotify</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-w6n8dwOalH2R2nXSypi8KARe_M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089935/VRG_ILLO_1777_Gimlet_Ringer_Spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsFVDs"&gt;Gimlet Media and &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt; agreed on a three-year union employment contract with Spotify, marking a historic moment for both the tech giant and the podcasting industry. The contracts cover diversity at the company, salary bases, annual raises, and titles. It’s a big step — not just for unionization in podcasting, but also for the tech industry overall, which has been slow to take up unionization and faced union-busting tactics when they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWR5mD"&gt;The Writers Guild of America, East, which represents Gimlet and &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wgaeast.org/gimlet-media-and-the-ringer-ratify-first-podcast-contracts-at-spotify"&gt;publicized the contract details today&lt;/a&gt;. (Disclosure: Vox Media’s editorial staff, which includes &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is also unionized with WGAE.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DUD5p"&gt;Salary minimums begin at $57,000 plus overtime for &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt; staff and $73,000 for Gimlet Media associate producers. All union members are guaranteed at least a 2 percent annual increase, and if they’re laid off, they’ll receive at least 11 weeks of severance. Management also guarantees that at least 50 percent of candidates for open unit positions after the phone interview stage will be from underrepresented backgrounds, including BIPOC, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities, and military veterans. Contractors also must either be offered a full-time job after 10 months, or the companies must let them know 30 days in advance that they will not be brought on full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rPLQgp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This contract agreement lasts for three years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NsOPNb"&gt;Notably missing from the contract, however, is any clause about intellectual property, a sticking point that union members tweeted about and said was a difficult agreement to reach. The union members wanted to own their work and control what happened to it after its creation. This would also mean profiting from that work and sharing in the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCCmYq"&gt;“As it stands, that is where we are — we do not have control over intellectual property in our contract, we do not have control over derivative works in our contract,” says Dan Devine, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt;. “That’s certainly something to keep working on as we go forward and other media shops do as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdyjrM"&gt;Of course, intellectual property was always something Spotify would be hard-pressed to cede control or revenue over. It’s a big part of its podcast strategy — building shows that could be turned into movies or TV shows in the future. Other WGAE contracts, including Vox Media’s, do account for IP. Vox’s, for example, pays union members up to $100,000 in some instances for derivative works based on their reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="INot7d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify still needs to reach an agreement with Parcast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPioV0"&gt;Spotify still needs to reach one more contract agreement with its Parcast podcast network,  but presumably, the Gimlet and &lt;em&gt;Ringer&lt;/em&gt; contracts will serve as a reference point for those future conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcHP5b"&gt;The agreements were reached last month, during a particularly dicey time for &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/gimlet-reply-all-controversy-spotify-test-kitchen.html"&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Reply All &lt;/em&gt;miniseries &lt;em&gt;The Test Kitchen&lt;/em&gt;, which delved into the allegedly toxic and racist culture at &lt;em&gt;Bon Appétit&lt;/em&gt;, was canceled because former Gimlet employee Eric Eddings accused two hosts, PJ Vogt and Sruthi Pinnamaneni, of creating a “near-identical toxic environment at Gimlet.” Vogt stepped away from the show after the allegations surfaced, as did Pinnamaneni. The allegations focus on Gimlet prior to its Spotify acquisition and also touch on how the company treated contract workers, like stringing them along without ever offering full-time work. The union contract looks to prevent some of those issues, like contract workers being undervalued, moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDHkdg"&gt;This represents a landmark deal for both the podcasting and tech industry. Longtime podcasting and radio organization NPR has been unionized under SAG-AFTRA for years, as have digital media companies with podcasting efforts, but individual networks, like Gimlet, haven’t been widely represented through unions yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RmlaUd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify will eventually house three separate unions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OsuTYl"&gt;Meanwhile, tech giants, like Amazon, have resisted recognizing or supporting their workers’ unions. Its Alabama warehouse workers voted last week on the decision to unionize, and the world is still awaiting the results. This doesn’t mean tech employees aren’t trying to unionize, however. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;Google employees and contractors announced the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU), a group affiliated with Communications Workers of America, in January, but AWU is a solidarity union, meaning it’s not recognized by the National Labor Relations Board and can’t force Google management to negotiate a contract for its members. Employees at Medium also tried to unionize but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307415/medium-union-effort-stalls-one-vote-short-majority-cwa"&gt;fell one vote short&lt;/a&gt;. The company then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349175/medium-layoffs-union-evan-williams-blogger-twitter-subscription"&gt;offered buyouts&lt;/a&gt; to its entire editorial team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfjOis"&gt;Kickstarter employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/18/21142308/kickstarter-employee-vote-union-unionize"&gt;unionized last year&lt;/a&gt;, making them the first major tech-oriented union, but they have yet to reach a deal with the company. Employees at Glitch have also unionized, with Glitch reaching a contract agreement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307671/glitch-workers-sign-historic-collective-bargaining-agreement-cwa"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch will ban people for harassment, even when it doesn’t happen on the site</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1kt2QTjmAW0uaHCNpupcoE-oXY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089931/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vufwr7"&gt;Twitch will now ban users who harass members of its community — even when that harassment takes place off Twitch. The streaming platform announced a &lt;a href="http://static-development.twitch.tv.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/p/en/legal/community-guidelines/off-service-conduct-policy/"&gt;major expansion of its off-service misconduct policy today&lt;/a&gt; that allows it to take action against users who mistreat people regardless of where it happens, whether it’s offline or on another social platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJNYOz"&gt;The new policy splits misconduct into two categories: category one, which applies to harassment that takes place on &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; off Twitch, and category two, which applies only to harassment off Twitch. The first category hasn’t changed. If Twitch is reviewing a harassment report about something that happened on-stream, it will take into account related harassment on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt8SK7"&gt;The second category,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;however,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is new. Now, if Twitch finds out about “serious offenses that pose a substantial safety risk to the Twitch community,” it’ll take action, even when those offenses took place entirely off the platform. The company is currently defining “serious offenses” as incidents of violent extremism, credible threats of mass violence, membership in a known hate group, sexual exploitation of children, and nonconsensual sexual activities, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGlFFI"&gt;Twitch is bringing on a third-party law firm to assist with off-platform investigations. “These investigations are vastly more complex and can take significant time and resources to resolve,” &lt;a href="http://blog-bucket-b58e0ubcuamv.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/en/2021/04/07/our-plan-for-addressing-severe-off-service-misconduct/"&gt;the company wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “For behaviors that take place off Twitch, we must rely more heavily on law enforcement and other services to share relevant evidence before we can move forward.” A spokesperson for the company declined to give the name of the law firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9181F"&gt;The move comes after Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165342/twitch-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy-update"&gt;overhauled its harassment policy last December&lt;/a&gt;. The changes included stricter rules around sexual harassment and a ban on promoting hateful opinions under the pretense of comedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOJAxV"&gt;In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers"&gt;the company faced a reckoning around sexual harassment and assault&lt;/a&gt;, with multiple women coming forward to say it hadn’t done enough to protect them. While some of those incidents took place on the streaming platform, others happened off-site but involved members of the Twitch community. One streamer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that an adult began sending them sexual messages on Twitch when they were 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRpLQS"&gt;In its announcement today, Twitch said it is focusing on “the most egregious types of physical and psychological harm” to start but implied it could expand the off-service harassment policy later on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJwyOO"&gt;The company also said it will suspend users who submit a large number of fake reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePL0YZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQhgQi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Hey Spotify’ is another hands-free way to control your music, rolling out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kl7xJi5_OwkKoi3zYf8_x0keld4=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089913/hey_spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: John Legend is a Vox Media board member.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hkV8Cp"&gt;If you want to pull up your favorite Spotify track or playlist without pressing buttons, there is no shortage of voice assistants to help you get those jams, including &lt;a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/listen_everywhere/voice_assistants/"&gt;Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, and even Bixby&lt;/a&gt;. But now, Spotify has its own hands-free wake word: “Hey Spotify” appears to be rolling out on Android and iOS, as tested by &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSM Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/07/hey-spotify-starts-roll-out-iphone/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBA4oK"&gt;Frankly, it’s a little less handy than some of the native voice assistants built into your phone because you need to &lt;em&gt;leave the app open&lt;/em&gt; for it to work — it’s not something you’ll launch with your phone asleep or with Spotify simply running in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47OKtQ"&gt;But if you have the app open, you can just say “Hey Spotify” and ask it to play a song; pull up a playlist; launch a radio station; and skip, pause, or play. We also found the “Play something I like” command would pull up a random one of our Daily Mix playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wARZwodzNDY_yR3IzI5TLorUuTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427128/spotify_hey_pano.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0iRPOM"&gt;The phone version of the feature’s been in the works for at least a year, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1235350117802283011"&gt;as app researcher Jane Manchun Wong discovered last March&lt;/a&gt;. The app should prompt you to get started if the feature’s rolled out to you by now, but you might be able to find the toggle manually under Settings &amp;gt; Microphone permissions &amp;gt; “Hey Spotify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8X621"&gt;Why now? Why bother when other voice assistants can do this without launching an app? I imagine that’s because Spotify is tracking toward its &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; hardware, where its voice assistant &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;be always on and always ready. Specifically, Spotify appears to be tracking toward the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364630/spotify-car-thing-renders-app-leak-music-player-hardware-product"&gt;its Car Thing&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/17/18628772/spotify-car-thing-audio-experience-data-premium-assistant"&gt;Spotify smart assistant for your vehicle&lt;/a&gt; that  was reported to include a “Hey Spotify” voice command &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18188523/spotify-in-car-music-player-release-date-price"&gt;way back in January 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2N9sX"&gt;Having the same voice command on your phone makes sense; users might get used to it, and start looking for it, after they exit their vehicles. And while they’re at it, I also wouldn’t be surprised if we see some “Hey Spotify” headphones or earbuds sometime in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is upgrading all monthly subscribers to unlimited plans for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwufsc3BdVRH2LL_gTqjhtMKIcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089880/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MVkFA8"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ft-mobiles-next-un-carrier-move-5gforall&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371868%2Ftmobile-unlimited-plans-postpaid-upgrade-automatically-offer-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that it will upgrade all existing postpaid phone plan customers to unlimited plans for free. It’s also announcing a promotion for customers of competing carriers interested in switching to T-Mobile, so AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon plan owners on fixed data plans can trade in their phones for a free Samsung Galaxy A32 5G smartphone and a T-Mobile unlimited plan with 5G access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6dYpG"&gt;“Today, 60 million Americans are stuck on limited data plans from Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T … most with limited or no 5G access. With the Great Unlimited Trade-Up, those people can trade up to both unlimited data and full access to T-Mobile’s expansive 5G network — including Ultra Capacity and Extended Range — all at the same or better price than the Carriers’ offer for limited data plans today,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ft-mobiles-next-un-carrier-move-5gforall&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371868%2Ftmobile-unlimited-plans-postpaid-upgrade-automatically-offer-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reads a press release&lt;/a&gt; the company put out this morning in connection with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G home internet service announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “And if you’re an existing T-Mobile postpaid customer — including all former Sprint customers — still on a limited data plan, you’re covered, too. You’re getting an upgrade to unlimited. For free,” reads the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfngR1"&gt;T-Mobile is making a substantial push to sign up new subscribers and get more existing ones onto its 5G network, and today’s announcements mark some of its most aggressive marketing yet with its offer of free phones and free unlimited plan upgrades. Of course, as with many carrier deals like these, there’s the fine print. For the trade-up promotion to the Samsung A32 5G, for example, T-Mobile says “you get a free 5G smartphone after 24 monthly bill credits and pay only the sales tax,” so it’s important to keep that in mind when considering a promotion to switch networks and trade in an old device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft have a driver shortage problem, and it’s costing them a lot of money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NYC bill could put Uber and yellow Cabs on single app platform" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EepLbh43Ker1tsBiyIcqq1k0lR0=/0x1:3410x2274/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089857/1286017864.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hXsyua"&gt;Uber and Lyft have a driver shortage problem. With the number of US-based drivers for both apps down around 40 percent, the two companies are pledging to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to lure people back into the driver seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbdIHm"&gt;Uber announced Wednesday that it was launching a $250 million “stimulus” for drivers in the hopes of speeding their return to the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDgwS0"&gt;“In 2020, many drivers stopped driving because they couldn’t count on getting enough trips to make it worth their time,” Dennis Cinelli, Uber’s vice president for mobility in the US and Canada, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fgetting-drivers-back-on-the-road%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371850%2Fuber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “In 2021, there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available to give them—making it a great time to be a driver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YXEg1F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a great time to be a driver”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJBt8d"&gt;Lyft, meanwhile, is covering the cost of rental cars, offering $800 bonuses to drivers to return to the app, and doling out extra cash to drivers when a trip lasts longer than nine minutes, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2b71e009-bb96-46ee-b024-4c574ef41988"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOWhLk"&gt;The hope is that these incentives can help persuade those drivers who logged off after being discouraged by the lack of riders to eventually come back. A major challenge for this effort, though, is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277043/uber-lyft-earnings-q4-2020-profit-loss-covid"&gt;COVID-19 continues to be a huge drag on Uber’s and Lyft’s respective businesses&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj6Mz0"&gt;As case numbers spiked over the winter, both companies lost a significant portion of their customer base. People stayed at home, or when they did go out, they opted not to use ride-hailing apps. In the last quarter of 2020, Uber said it had only 93 million “monthly active platform consumers,” its term for users who take at least one ride on Uber or buy at least one meal on Uber Eats — a 16 percent decrease year over year. Meanwhile, Lyft reported a drop in monthly active users of 45 percent, from 22 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 12.5 million in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDUXGT"&gt;Uber claims that the demand is “coming back,” though how much we won’t know until the company reports its first earnings report for 2021. It seems logical that as vaccination rates continue to go up, more people will start using Uber and Lyft again. But that will depend on many factors, including offices reopening, leisure activities returning, business travel rebounding, and people starting to return to their daily routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFvF99"&gt;According to data from Apptopia, the number of US-based drivers logging into Uber during the first three months of 2021 was down 37.5 percent year over year. Lyft saw a 42.3 percent drop over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lud0uN"&gt;Last year, both companies were focused on reducing costs, and often that meant actively constraining its supply of drivers. In its last earnings report, Lyft said it had to block new drivers from joining the app in some markets, while reducing its spending on marketing and other incentives. “Given the effect on demand, we were able to reduce driver acquisition and incentive spend, which had a positive impact on our financial results,” Lyft CEO Logan Green said in an earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ztMv1"&gt;With wait times increasing in some cities, the companies will now have to reverse course and spend money to encourage drivers to come back to the app. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google I/O returns this May — but as a virtual event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5q3gt3y0_Dl7XveJxcYTUccgkk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089825/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6vr86"&gt;Google’s I/O developer event is returning this year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188669/google-i-o-canceled-2020-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;being canceled in 2020&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and like many other tech events that have taken place during the pandemic, it will be entirely virtual. The event will take place from May 18th through the 20th and will be free to attend, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-2021-announced/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which revealed the date after solving &lt;a href="https://events.google.com/io/punchcard?lng=en"&gt;Google’s cryptic I/O puzzle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETd0NC"&gt;Typically, Google uses I/O to show off significant updates to its products, new hardware (in 2019, the company revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530449/google-pixel-3a-xl-review-photos-video-specs-price-release-date-features-io-2019"&gt;Pixel 3A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18529318/google-nest-hub-max-smart-display-camera-price-features-specs-release-hands-on-io-2019"&gt;Nest Hub Max smart display&lt;/a&gt;), and occasionally, big initiatives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018"&gt;like the AI-powered reservation service Google Duplex&lt;/a&gt;. It seems likely that Google will show off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;more of Android 12&lt;/a&gt; during this year’s conference, but beyond that, we’ll have to wait to see what’s in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISY8Ab"&gt;As restrictions on gatherings remain in place because of the pandemic, other tech companies have also announced virtual events for this year. Microsoft has revealed that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364374/microsoft-build-may-remote-developer-conference"&gt;Build conference&lt;/a&gt; will happen from May 25th to 27th, and Apple has announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;its Worldwide Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt; will take place from June 7th to 11th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CodeMiko will see you now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VFPQrNh4cbxf-nskwLfjBPKLuzg=/11x0:2330x1546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089793/Miko_Headshot_Full__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Chatting with Twitch’s newest virtual talk show star&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZKj9Qo"&gt;When I watch CodeMiko, I think a lot about unreality — though not for the obvious reasons. While Miko is a virtual creation, a punkish motion-captured digital avatar with a knack for performing her personality, I find myself more interested in the nature of her performance itself; she’s just magnetic, and I’m not sure I can describe why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bB3Icg"&gt;I could tell you that her streams are a combination of interviews with big-name streamers, fiddling with motion capture software, and bizarre interactions with chat. I could mention that since her start last March, Miko’s channel has amassed 640,000 followers and that she now streams to more than &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/codemiko"&gt;7,000 viewers at any given moment&lt;/a&gt; she’s live. But I’m not convinced any of that contains the true nature of her gonzo appeal. What I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; sure of is that Miko is here to stay, and whatever it is she’s up to is reshaping the Twitch landscape in her image — and giving everyone a healthy dose of the bizarre in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i23WZ"&gt;Behind CodeMiko is a real human being — whose name is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Miko but who seemingly prefers to be called Miko — who plays a character referred to as The Technician in the fiction of the stream. The Technician keeps Miko’s hardware running, and it’s her I reached over video chat the other day to talk about the character’s appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KjEze"&gt;“Miko is a failed video game character. Her dream is she wants to be in a triple-A video game but she’s so scuffed and glitchy that she was unable to,” says The Technician, who is also Miko. “So she started trying to do Twitch streaming instead.” Miko The Technician describes Miko the virtual streamer as someone who fits the classic archetype of the struggling Hollywood actress — someone who just wants to be in a movie, any movie, except in Miko’s case, it’s literally any game. (Heads up, game devs.) “She’s kind of an NPC,” Miko (The Technician) says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d9mtsl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Are You Religious Young Man? With &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vgdunkey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@vgdunkey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HtkgWssyK1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HtkgWssyK1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miko (@thecodemiko) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecodemiko/status/1362854953698484224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oZOSuO"&gt;I should pause a moment here to note that yes, I am profiling a virtual creation — a streamer who, technically speaking, does not exist, at least not in our meat realm. Though she’s not alone in not existing and creating content nonetheless. By now, you may have heard of Miko’s counterparts, vtubers — “virtual YouTubers,” which is a term that’s now a catchall for a hugely popular segment of online entertainers who use digital prosthetics to obscure their faces and bodies. Miko isn’t a true vtuber, I don’t think, because the human behind the whole thing is widely known and regularly shows her face on camera. I am aware that this distinction may be considered splitting hairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNANyD"&gt;In any case: at this point, CodeMiko’s reputation is beginning to precede her, at least on Twitch. In the early days, Technician-Miko would do everything, in her own words — all of the designing, programming, admin, and marketing work that goes into being a full-time virtual streamer. “When I was doing it by myself, I had a very strict schedule of going to sleep around 9PM, waking up at 2AM, and then devving until like 12PM,” says Miko of those early days. “And 12:30PM, I’ll stream, and I’ll stream to like 5 or 6.” And she used to do that every single day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17lXxq"&gt;Now, however, she’s hired a team, and her schedule is different. Having thousands of concurrent viewers a stream will change a streamer’s life, if not necessarily their priorities. These days, Miko’s attention is split, she says, in a million different ways, and she’s mostly managing and supervising her accounts when she’s not streaming. That, of course, was a consequence of just how quickly Miko was growing on Twitch. “I think I went from like 200 to like 10,000 viewers in like a couple of weeks,” she says. The growth came from a single viral tweet posted at the end of November, which showed a side-by-side video of streamer Miko and Technician-Miko. “That tweet kind of went viral and that boosted me up to my first 1,000 viewers,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aaZtrn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WANNA SEE SOME TECH?!! This is Miko being mocapped live by technician with facial tracking! &lt;a href="https://t.co/a3A5gLWANv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/a3A5gLWANv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miko (@thecodemiko) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecodemiko/status/1332954045326082049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bABjKw"&gt;And that’s when things took off. Her clips began circulating on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/"&gt;r/LivestreamFail&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as a kind of repository of Twitch drama; bigger streamers would see them there and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21234731/raids-twitch-mixer-live-streaming-community"&gt;raid her&lt;/a&gt;, and then she’d interview them on her show. It was a virtuous cycle that catapulted Miko into Twitch stardom, which is also something it’s clear she hasn’t totally processed yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ8akM"&gt;“When I was like 200, 300 viewers, I was like ‘When I hit 1,000 viewers, that’s going to be my goal, and it’s gonna feel so great. And I’ll be like, good,’” she says. “But I hit 1,000. And then the next day, I hit 2,000. And the next day, I hit 3,000.” She tells me she feels grateful, and that, yes, it’s awesome. But it’s only now, a few months since she was thrust into the limelight, that she seems to be coming to terms with the idea of being a prominent person on Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZCSex"&gt;That makes sense; &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; blows up this fast on Twitch. Miko started her streaming career because she was laid off from the animation studio she worked at just after moving to Los Angeles last March — which, as you’ll recall, also happened to be the early days of the pandemic in America. She had to keep paying her $2,000-a-month lease in LA, which wouldn’t be up for almost a whole year. “And I thought, you know what would be the good thing to do right now isn’t to try to look for work,” she says. “Let me put down 20 grand and try to make it on Twitch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWuQuB"&gt;And that’s exactly what she did. “My suit was around 12 to 13k. And then I had my computer, my iPhone cam, my helmet, and then my software subscriptions as well. But the mocap software subscription is actually really expensive as well,” she says. She put the $20,000 investment on her credit card. “I told myself I’m not gonna have a backup. Because if I did have a backup, then I’ll give up,” she says. “If I don’t have a backup then you have to make it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1pcRcQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Technician will be getting a new MOCAP SUIT soon that will allow her to PEE whenever she wants. thank god&lt;/p&gt;— Miko (@thecodemiko) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecodemiko/status/1379526620835274753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OuXWtP"&gt;And Miko has. She’s built up a world around herself filled with fascinating characters and extremely clippable moments. She’s been temporarily banned from Twitch a couple of times in the past — which, when I talk to her, she doesn’t seem very stressed about even though, each time, her livelihood has been on the line. As Nathan Grayson &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/codemiko-is-the-future-of-streaming-unless-twitch-bans-1846349881"&gt;reports over at &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Miko’s bans thus far have seemingly been for small slip-ups that violate the letter — if not the spirit — of Twitch’s TOS. (Like the time she let her viewers pay to send her “D pics,” which were literally pictures of the letter “D” that would show up on her phone. Twitch did not appear to find the joke funny.) “Bans make your IP more interesting,” Miko says, laughing. “[It] gives a little bit of color.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIANJe"&gt;Whatever happens, it’s clear that Miko — the streamer or The Technician — is here to stay. And she’s planning new things for chat to try out, too. “I’m trying to make like a &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Carpool Karaoke&lt;/em&gt; on crack. I’ll have the guests, we’ll be driving in a car,” she says. “And we’ll be going through the city, trying to get to our destination, while chat obstructs the road with various things.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrU51d"&gt;Chatting with her, I get the distinct impression that Miko — whichever Miko you prefer to imagine — has an inexhaustible well of ideas for her channel. It’s like talking to someone at a party in the wee hours of the morning, when the world feels slightly tilted, in just the right way. It just works, though saying that obscures just how much effort goes into her channel. A successful performance is about finding what works for an audience, and Miko is dedicated to trying anything she thinks might delight her fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iLEYya"&gt;“I’ll make it and then if it works, keep it,” she says. “If it doesn’t work, throw it away.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhSaTh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jon Stewart’s Apple TV Plus show will debut this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Late Show with Stephen Colbert..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NcrQ2qvtXJUOI1zSbaGRSYkS14k=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69089773/1150560659.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KIamC"&gt;Jon Stewart is heading back to TV with a new Apple TV Plus show, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, which will debut this fall, Apple announced on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yso27H"&gt;“‘The Problem with Jon Stewart’ is a multiple season, one-hour, single-issue series which will explore topics that are currently part of the national conversation and his advocacy work,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-reveals-series-title-for-jon-stewarts-highly-anticipated-return-to-television-as-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-to-debut-in-fall-2021-on-apple-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22371914%2Fjon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Each season of the series will be further explored in a companion podcast to continue the discussion.” Apple didn’t specify how many episodes will be included in each season or how many seasons the show will run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmjsb0"&gt;The iPhone maker says this is the first project of a multiyear partnership with the popular political commentator, so it sounds like we could see more shows with Stewart’s involvement on Apple TV Plus in the future. Apple has also signed a first-look deal with Stewart and his production company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFQf5Q"&gt;Apple first announced the show was in development &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;last October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt; marks Stewart’s return to TV, following the end of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, which wrapped in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kcSLEQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jon Stewart will return to TV with an Apple TV Plus series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
