    <title>Code suggests Google’s folding Pixel will return to 12-megapixel camera next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhPdxC"&gt;Google’s rumored foldable device could release next year with similar camera hardware to what older Pixel phones used prior to this year’s big Pixel 6 overhaul, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Reports about the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;first emerged this summer&lt;/a&gt;, at which point it was expected to launch before the end of the year. Now the device, whose codename appears to have changed from “Passport” to “Pipit,” seems to be on track for a launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD9huF"&gt;These latest details have emerged thanks to code discovered in the Google Camera app. In particular, they suggest that the foldable will use a 12.2-megapixel IMX363 sensor for its main camera. That suggests the foldable won’t be equipped with the same 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 camera sensor Google used on this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the IMX363 is the sensor Google used for the Pixel 3 through 5. Its lower resolution suggests the foldable might struggle to match the excellent camera quality of the Pixel 6 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z77dsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google switched to a 50-megapixel main sensor with the Pixel 6&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwxnjy"&gt;Aside from the main sensor, the code snippets suggest the Pixel foldable’s other cameras will be more in line with the Pixel 6. There’s a 12-megapixel IMX386 that’s expected to handle ultrawide shots and two 8-megapixel IMX355 sensors for its selfie cameras. Two selfie cameras appear to be necessary to allow selfies to be taken while the foldable is both open and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sfjZd"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, it’s not uncommon to see companies equip foldables with less powerful camera hardware than their flagships. The recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, for example, had a 12-megapixel sensor rather than the 108-megapixel sensor Samsung used in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But it might be a disappointment for anyone expecting Google’s rumored foldable to match the camera quality of its latest flagships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duYy3l"&gt;A release date of next year makes sense for the foldable given what we know about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;Android 12L&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming Android update that’s due to launch early next year and is designed to offer a range of improvements for devices with larger screens, including foldables. The update, which has previously been referred to as Android 12.1, also contains code suggesting Google might have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;second foldable device in development&lt;/a&gt; under the codename “Jumbojack.” It’s unclear when, or even if, this second foldable may be released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’s latest overkill gaming phones arrive in Europe with up to 18GB of RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AwUsM0jHvmwjR7mNiHB8BMW66kI=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099241/msedge_5BtFPuHiJl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro, which has a small display on its rear.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dPFt5t"&gt;Asus has announced pricing for the ROG Phone 5S series in Europe, following their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630283/asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features"&gt;launch in Taiwan in August&lt;/a&gt;. The ROG Phone 5S costs €999 for 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, while €1,099 gets you a step-up model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The top of the line 5S Pro has an excessive 18GB of RAM and the same 512GB of storage and retails for €1,299. Meanwhile in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/asus/158977-asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-specs-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pocket-Lint&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 16GB model will cost £999, and the 18GB Pro model will set you back £1,099, but there’s no mention of pricing for the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhmTIR"&gt;The ROG Phone 5S and 5S Pro are functionally minor updates to the ROG Phone 5 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that Asus released earlier this year. They have a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus processor and their screens have a more responsive 360Hz touch-sampling rate (their 144Hz refresh rates are unchanged), but the core specs remain the same. They still have 6.78-inch 1080p displays, 6,000mAh batteries, and triple-rear camera array with 64-megapixel main sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GF2DBifVWw0Z2mNXy6H_kAYIcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22987984/h732.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The non-Pro ROG Phone 5S, which comes in black or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gJJAmG"&gt;Although European pricing for the phones has now been announced, exact release dates seem to vary from country to country. In the UK, for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fuk%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ online store&lt;/a&gt; currently doesn’t offer links to preorder the phones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Ffr%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In France&lt;/a&gt; the 16GB model of the ROG Phone 5S is available to buy now, but the 12GB and 18GB RAM variants are due to ship on November 19th. We’re yet to hear about any US release plans for the new phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia will finally let you join multiplayer games without an invite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTBbUTWOJVT_cmI_OPIf1jAESRA=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099126/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cMmzYF"&gt;Google is finally allowing Stadia players to join multiplayer games without needing an invite. This basic feature is available on most console platforms and PC launchers, but it has taken Google nearly two years to add it to Stadia. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9611855?p=privacy_settings&amp;amp;visit_id=637716624789453781-1844496392&amp;amp;rd=1#currentgame"&gt;A new support page&lt;/a&gt; confirms the feature is live in &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6 &lt;/em&gt;on Stadia&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; so friends can join you without you having to dig into menus and issue an invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVkjAH"&gt;Google mentions the feature is only available in “select games,” and is disabled by default. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/stadia-join-game-rollout/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the feature is actually enabled by default, and we’ve confirmed it’s also been enabled on one of our Stadia accounts. The join without an invite feature is also available in the Stadia app for Android, and is available through the web version that runs on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8d0JX"&gt;Google has been gradually adding features to Stadia over the past two years since its launch, including a new 30-minute game trial for &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/details/e85d550899de407e996a8a2d9dfbc7efrcp1/sku/4db0c5af19c74032beb90d083dfb9431p?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month. The future of Stadia still looks more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;like a whitelabel service&lt;/a&gt; for game developers and other companies looking to stream games, and last month AT&amp;amp;T started offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;browser-based version of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;using Stadia’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government offers $10 million bounty for information on Colonial Pipeline hackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fuel Storage On Canvey Island" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJmTlyO1covQpVQ0AnQxuQw0VaU=/0x3:4579x3056/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70098956/1332362213.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Colonial Pipeline attack targeted key fuel pipelines, like these pipes seen in Canvey Island, in the UK. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KPC0iY"&gt;In May, a ransomware attack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;shut down a pipeline&lt;/a&gt; carrying 45 percent of the fuel used on the US East Coast. The Colonial Pipeline incident led to panic buying and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;heightened fears&lt;/a&gt; about the threat posed by simple hacks to national infrastructure. Now, the US State Department is &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/reward-offers-for-information-to-bring-darkside-ransomware-variant-co-conspirators-to-justice/"&gt;offering a bounty of up to $10 million&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who can supply the “identity or location” of the leaders of the group responsible — an outfit known as DarkSide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W1NvE"&gt;In addition to the $10 million bounty, the state department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction “of any individual conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in a DarkSide variant ransomware incident.” What exactly that means isn’t clear. Is a “DarkSide variant ransomware incident” one that involves the group’s hacking tools? What if the software has been altered slightly? It seems deliberately ambiguous, allowing the State Department to cast as wide a net as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Afky6O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fighting ransomware with bounties&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UNxtZV"&gt;The offer is the latest example of the US using monetary rewards to try and fight serious cybercrime. These bounties are offered under the &lt;a href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/about-rfj/frequently-asked-questions.html"&gt;Rewards for Justice (RfJ) program&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally established in 1984 to target international terrorism. The US evidently thinks cybercriminals now warrant the same level of attention and, in &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/rewards-for-justice-reward-offer-for-information-on-foreign-malicious-cyber-activity-against-u-s-critical-infrastructure/"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the State Department began offering bounties of up to $10 million through RfJ for information on individuals who participate in “malicious cyber activities against US critical infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXuFUC"&gt;(For anyone interested, the State Department has a Tor-based tip line, accessible at he5dybnt7sr6cm32xt77pazmtm65flqy6irivtflruqfc5ep7eiodiad.onion. This URL requires the use of a Tor browser and won’t work with ordinary browsers like Chrome or Firefox.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsprAa"&gt;The ambiguous nature of the State Department’s latest bounty is related to the fluid nature of hacking groups. These outfits can dissolve and reform under different monikers and identities as easily as someone creating a new username, but they often use related methods and software that can be used to trace a common lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5PZzp"&gt;DarkSide, for example, ceased all activities after the Colonial Pipeline incident. The group seemed caught off-guard by the magnitude of the attack, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;issued a formal apology&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences” of what they did. But according to US cybersecurity experts, members of the group &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-291a"&gt;may have simply rebranded&lt;/a&gt; as an outfit named BlackMatter, which appeared on the scene weeks after DarkSide dropped off the radar, wielding similar weapons and tactics. Presumably, the state department’s bounty will apply to them, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter makes it easier to search tweets from specific accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OF4Q2DtfOnqfs_h9dlOFmc1HmNA=/0x0:848x565/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70098948/IMG_1632_crop.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search button appears on the top right of a user’s profile page on iOS.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LXvr0Q"&gt;Twitter has added a new search button on profile pages that makes it easier to search through tweets from a specific user. Social media consultant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1447556138145394692"&gt;Matt Navarra&lt;/a&gt; noted that the button had started appearing for a small number of users last month, but now &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/twitter-making-it-easier-dig-into-tweet-history-ios/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; that the feature has rolled out widely in the service’s iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk5RPM"&gt;Being able to limit a search to a single user’s tweets is not a new Twitter feature. You can achieve the same result by using the format “from:[Twitter handle] [search term]” in the regular Twitter search box. So, for example, if you wanted to search my (bad) tweets for every time I mentioned the word “keyboard,” you could tap the search icon in the app and enter: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="I0Idvj"&gt;from:jonporty keyboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0oT7Nf"&gt;The new button makes life just a bit easier. It could be helpful if, for example, you want to find an article you vaguely remember someone tweeting about months ago but can’t remember the specifics of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7zfX0"&gt;The new search button is a small example of the flurry of new features Twitter has been adding to its service in recent months. Just last week the platform rolled out the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753072/twitter-super-follows-subscription-ios"&gt;iOS users globally to Super Follow Twitter accounts&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they’re now able to pay for access to bonus content from creators on the platform. That same month, Twitter also started letting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739249/twitter-finally-letting-everyone-create-spaces"&gt;anyone host one of its an audio-only Space chatrooms&lt;/a&gt;. Other new features include its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;Twitter Blue subscription service&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661649/twitter-releases-communities-facebook-groups-reddit-competitor"&gt;Communities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI releases new flagship Mavic drones — Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZ4JJvdA5RvBp2r2JTc8KCPwAwk=/0x1:2048x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70097389/DJI_Mavic_3___Forest_11.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BQd9yt"&gt;One of the most anticipated drone releases is finally out. Actually, it’s two drones. Today, DJI has released the Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UN7LO3"&gt;There are a few big headline features shared between both of the new drones, but let’s start with the one reserved for the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine. The Cine model is capable of filming Apple ProRes 422 HQ footage at 5.1K up to 50FPS, and it has a built-in, but not user-replaceable, 1TB SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="okX7Tn"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IJLDbq"&gt;The cheaper $2,199 Mavic 3 doesn’t come with ProRes or a built-in SSD but shares the same dual-camera system powered by a 4/3 CMOS sensor. Both drones are capable of filming in 4K at up to 120fps and capturing 20MP photos. In addition to the main 24mm lens, there is also a hybrid zoom lens capable of 28x digital zoom. In focal length terms, that equates to 162mm at f/4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0DYLQwUh17DqMllJ_3cUjlErQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983162/DJI_Mavic_3___Canyon___Mountains_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Both drones have the same camera module, except Cine version can shoot 5.1K ProRes video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4p362e"&gt;Both drones have batteries rated for 46 minutes of flight time, which is a significant upgrade over the Mavic 2’s 31-minute battery and even the Mavic Air 2s &amp;amp; 2S, which could fly for 34 and 31 minutes on one charge, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKiG1H"&gt;The two drones are successors to DJI’s Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom released in 2018, which also introduced the first Hasselblad camera to be used in DJI drones after it acquired a majority stake in said company in 2017. But since 2018, we haven’t seen much Hasselblad branding in DJI products — until today. And just like in 2018, DJI is including &lt;em&gt;Hasselblad Natural Color Solution&lt;/em&gt;, which promises incredibly natural colors straight out of its camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZEhyK"&gt;But if you don’t want the built-in color profile, the Mavic 3 is also capable of filming footage in 10-bit D-log for more control over color in post-processing. In addition to ProRes encoding, you can all shoot in standard H.264 and H.265 profiles, but there is no HDR video on this drone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1gPJbh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10844021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vg0o53"&gt;Aside from all the camera improvements, DJI has also upgraded its autonomous features for the Mavic 3. Just like its predecessor, the Mavic 3 also shares omnidirectional obstacle sensing, except the sensors are now capable of detecting objects even 200m (650 feet) away, compared to 20m (65 feet) before. I’ve always found the sensor to be a bit too sensitive, so I’m curious to find out how they act now while near objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzXary"&gt;But that extra reach does enable some new improvements — &lt;em&gt;Advanced RTH &lt;/em&gt;(return to home), APAS 5.0 and ActiveTrack 5.0. Advanced RTH helps the drone plan out a more intelligent route on its way back to the launching position. And the APAS 5.0 does exactly that, except when you’re the one operating the drone. ActiveTrack 5.0, which won’t be available on release, promises great improvement over tracking and following subjects. Such as the ability to fly in any direction while following a subject and taking advantage of visual sensors on the camera body to continue tracking subjects if they go out of frame.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzvNvrfevY_fTfZEVnI6t6fOvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986400/DJI_Mavic_3___KV_02__desert_standard_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Courtesy of DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;DJI’s updated ActiveTrack 5.0 promises better autonomous flying and filming&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6oGHkZ"&gt;Both drones also come with updated versions of DJI’s proprietary transmission technology, OcuSync 3+, which promises 15km of range (in ideal conditions) and 1080p at 60fps live feed transmission to your smartphone or controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfZj2G"&gt;If you’re interested in buying this drone, there are three bundles to choose from. The standard version, which includes the drone, carrying strap, remote controller, charger, a set of extra propellers, and a joystick, will cost you $2,199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DonFRT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10846229"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BMdw1T"&gt;The Fly More Combo adds two additional batteries, a charging hub, four sets of propellers, a carrying case that also transforms into a backpack, and a set of ND filters (ND4, ND8, ND16 and ND32). The Fly More Combo will cost you $2,999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIKe5i"&gt;And the final bundle is the Cine Premium Combo, which means you won’t be able to buy the Cine version of the Mavic 3 without spending more money on the accessories that come with it — including a completely brand new DJI RC Pro. It’s a remote controller similar to the DJI Smart Controller that features a bright built-in screen. The Cine Premium combo also includes an additional set of ND filters (ND64, ND128, ND256, ND512) that you won’t find in the Fly More Combo. Again, the Cine Premium Combo bundle will cost you $4,999. All three bundles are available to order starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypGQTc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Instagram and Twitter buried the hatchet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbdLJskWWK1lK-oaSQEvxJOlbAk=/0x0:3188x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096773/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_e04ad522_42a5_43c9_9e1b_3bf39e6953b5_3400x2125.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://unsplash.com/@claybanks" target="_blank"&gt;Clay Banks&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/MQoKGgHZsbs" target="_blank"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rIyzCs"&gt;Today let’s talk about how two of the world’s most important social networks settled an ancient grudge, and what it tells us about the prospects for a more open internet as tech giants work to build a metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKpYeh"&gt;On Wednesday, Instagram &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?s=21"&gt;delivered an announcement nine years in the making&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2012, Instagram photos shared to Twitter have appeared only as plain text links. From now on, Instagram links will include a preview of the image — just as they did before Instagram sold to Facebook, and competitive pressures and professional rivalries combined to worsen our collective user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wB440P"&gt;“They said it would never happen,” Instagram tweeted Wednesday. And indeed, this reversal was one that few saw coming. The path to peace involved wine, pizza, and backyard dealmaking — but to really appreciate what happened, you have to start at the moment everything fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwKG28"&gt;When it launched in October 2010, Instagram was maybe the easiest way to share photos to Twitter. At the time, Twitter couldn’t even host photos itself; you had to post them through third-party services with confidence-inspiring names like Yfrog and Photobucket. Instagram, thanks primarily to its slick filters, quickly became one of the most popular ways to tweet photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suiLl7"&gt;There was also a personal connection between the apps’ founders. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had worked with future Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom at Twitter’s predecessor company, Odeo, and after Instagram launched became one of its most important early supporters. Dorsey regularly tweeted Instagram photos to his large following, and soon he was joined by early-to-Twitter celebrities including Justin Bieber and Snoop Dogg. Twitter benefited from the easy photo sharing; Instagram, meanwhile, grew its user base quickly on the back of a feature that let you find your friends from Twitter on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMUoqK"&gt;That all began to change in April 2012, when Facebook bought Instagram for &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/archive/instagram-facebook-price"&gt;$715 million&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter had also tried to buy the company, but lost out to Mark Zuckerberg and his promise to help Systrom and co-founder Mike Krieger reach global scale with minimal interference. Dorsey took the loss personally and stopped posting to Instagram forever. A few months later, Twitter blocked Instagram’s access to its following graph, preventing users from quickly finding their friends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTYm17"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We had some wine, we had some sausages, and then I finally brought it up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JWtJVy"&gt;Then, in December, Facebook &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/"&gt;retaliated&lt;/a&gt;: photos shared from Instagram would no longer appear in the Twitter timeline. As Sarah Frier recounts in her book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Filter-Inside-Story-Instagram-ebook/dp/B07TFB4R2S/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D20985381%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Filter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook executives believed enabling photo previews was only helping Twitter to grow and increase its available ad inventory. And so the company pulled the plug on link previews, and Twitter got so mad about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; that it leaked a story to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; alleging Systrom had perjured himself during the sale to Facebook. (Nothing ever really came of that, aside from bad feelings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxiXJi"&gt;Then nine years went by. Instagram’s co-founders quit Facebook in 2018. By then, Instagram had hit 1 billion users, most of them younger than their counterparts on Facebook. Twitter entered an extended period of stasis that only began to thaw in the past two years, when the company added hundreds of employees and began rapidly shipping new products under head of product Kayvon Beykpour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm0AwV"&gt;Every once in a while, the ban on Twitter link previews would come up internally, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri told me in an interview. Dorsey once sent him a direct message asking if they could work it out. But there were always higher priorities to address, and some lingering competitive concerns. (Twitter and Instagram compete more directly on photo sharing in Japan, for example, he said.) And so nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYl75H"&gt;Twitter, meanwhile, was increasingly open to cross-platform partnerships. It started &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/twitter/"&gt;a popular and hilarious Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546672/twitter-instagram-stories-share-tweets-ios"&gt;enabled the sharing of tweets directly to Instagram stories&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1372614335240007683?s=21"&gt;began embedding YouTube videos directly in tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39ylC5"&gt;I saw a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; story about that last item and, in the obnoxious fashion of many journalists, quote-tweeted it with a mild dunk. “Now do Instagram photos. Thanks!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1372614476780900352?s=21"&gt;I posted in March&lt;/a&gt;. “We’d like to. Takes two to tango,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1372614805857525761?s=21"&gt;Beykpour clapped back&lt;/a&gt;. I tagged in Mosseri and asked if I could interest him in a tango. Mosseri responded with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1372616225788895232?s=21"&gt;a GIF of a man dancing alone in kitchen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLsrdR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now do Instagram photos. Thanks! &lt;a href="https://t.co/K957UcuQWo"&gt;https://t.co/K957UcuQWo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1372614476780900352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bB3XG4"&gt;I then promptly forgot any of this had ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wccu83"&gt;Until yesterday, when Beykpour told me that, improbably, this interaction had somehow triggered a series of events that led to him and Mosseri eating pizza in Bruce Falck’s backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5E0d6y"&gt;“Credit to Adam,” Beykpour told me this week. “When I asked, I had zero expectation that it would happen. Just because, at this point, it’s &lt;em&gt;lore&lt;/em&gt; — like, it was not bound to be, because the gods had forbidden it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uByNlp"&gt;Falck is head of revenue products for Twitter. Before that, he was CEO of an ad tech company called Turn, where he got to know a longtime former employee named Vishal Shah, who left just before Falck took over. Shah went on to become head of product at Instagram; as of August, his title is vice president of metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4roPIr"&gt;After the Twitter tango exchange, Falck reached out to his old friend Shah to see if he and their bosses would be amenable to a parley. It was May, and COVID anxieties in the Bay Area were still simmering. And so instead of meeting at a restaurant, the foursome met up for pizza in Falck’s backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1TIJd"&gt;Beykpour and Mosseri had met in passing before, including once on a plane to South by Southwest. But they had never spent an extended amount of time together until that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbNfHG"&gt;In the end, it was Beykpour who broached the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JDBji"&gt;“We had some wine, we had some sausages, and then I finally brought it up,” Beykpour said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TBcpQn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instagram didn’t have a “philosophical” objection to showing photos in the timeline.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lG1FEc"&gt;Mosseri told Beykpour, as he later told me, that Instagram didn’t have a “philosophical” objection to showing photos in the timeline. Rather, it was a matter of freeing up some engineers to work on it. Mosseri said he would look into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt62YM"&gt;In the moment, Beykpour wasn’t sure if he believed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm64Sr"&gt;“We were like, ‘Okay, that’s nice,’” Beykpour said. “And we didn’t expect it was gonna go anywhere. But it did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6iArw"&gt;Unbeknownst to the Twitter team, Mosseri kept a list of what he called “finally features” — stuff that could be built relatively easily that the user base had been clamoring for. It’s the low-hanging fruit of the product world — stuff like letting everyone add links to their stories, a feature Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748303/instagram-link-stickers-stories-everyone-rolling-out-test"&gt;shipped last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8CAA6"&gt;“They’re not really a priority to the company strategically, but sometimes you’ve just gotta make time for that kind of work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWC7Qo"&gt;Back at his home office, Mosseri said he had only two real questions about switching link previews back on. One, would it create a competitive risk to Instagram? And two, would it create value for the user base?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvHTEo"&gt;In the end, he wasn’t confident he would be able to measure either risk accurately. But it seemed like users would like it, he said, and so he peeled off a couple engineers to start testing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HjVUJ"&gt;“You know what, why not just do a little bit more of what people are asking for,” he remembers himself thinking. “It seems like a good thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gyoSt"&gt;Testing took a couple months, but by this week it was ready. Beykpour told me he was grateful to Mosseri for working with Twitter — even if he’s already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1455966879168688134?s=20"&gt;needling&lt;/a&gt; his rival in the hopes of getting Instagram to adopt &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; image previews, rather than small ones. (Developers get to choose which of Twitter’s embed formats they use; when I asked Mosseri about it, he said Instagram was just “starting small.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BDPLB"&gt;Meanwhile, Mosseri recently held a hackathon to work on more “finally features,” some of which will be shipping soon. (An iPad app is not among them, he volunteered before I could ask.) And he seemed to be enjoying the newfound spirit of goodwill with Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wd1eYk"&gt;“I think it’s good to bury old hatchets,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOEaeV"&gt;Particularly given his parent company’s ambitious to build a world in which companies are much more integrated than they are today — a goal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;shared with me&lt;/a&gt; in announcing the company’s pivot to the metaverse this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eevEw8"&gt;“More and more, platforms are going to need to figure out how to be more open,” Mosseri said. “And that’s tricky. Data portability has huge privacy implications. I think we need to figure that out as an industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12Swnu"&gt;In the end, though, the only thing thing that was truly needed to end the Instagram-Twitter feud was time — and a willingness to put users’ needs ahead of strategic anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFexsm"&gt;“People don’t live on one product,” Beykpour said, noting the Twitter had also launched an integration with Snapchat last December. “They’re navigating in between them. So making those making those traversals feel convenient and colorful, I think, is important.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brembo’s ‘intelligent’ brake system could apply pressure to each wheel individually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LV0f3hAapNMUCiz4LOVkqQzhrs4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096345/SENSIFY_BREMBO_9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Brembo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zqMwi"&gt;High-end Italian brake manufacturer Brembo &lt;a href="https://www.brembo.com/en/ComunicatiStampa/2021/20211025_PR_Brembo_Unveils_ENG.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in October its plan to release Sensify, an AI-enhanced braking system that promises both “driving pleasure and total safety” when it rolls out via an unnamed manufacturer in 2024. Going beyond anti-lock brakes, traction, and stability control, it replaces hydraulic controls with electronic ones for design flexibility and, potentially, more precise control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XK6gZu"&gt;Incorporating AI into vehicles isn’t new, as algorithms control playlists, maps, driver assistance, and even “self-driving” to various degrees. AI-based brake systems, however, are enough to raise eyebrows about how exactly they will work or enhance safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raZ6NN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re only as good as the training data you have”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5mACbq"&gt;“As you start to deal with artificial intelligence and neural networks, they’re only as good as the training data you have,” said J. Christian Gerdes, an engineering professor and co-director of the Center of Automotive Research at Stanford University. “If you have a new case that represents something it hasn’t seen before, it’s hard to know in advance what it decides to do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tFkHg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry-news-tech,-development-and-manufacturing/brembo-sensify-revolutionary-new-ai"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autocar UK&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Sensify is using a “dedicated app” to program itself based on data and enhance the driving experience. The system supposedly will use predictive algorithms, sensors, and data management tools that give it a “digital brain” capable of controlling each wheel independently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tt3H06"&gt;Gerdes says that modern anti-lock brake systems, first introduced in the 1970s, are a Band-Aid for wheels locking up under heavy braking. “What would make more sense is to have an understanding of what’s going on at each of your wheels. And to then intelligently ask for brake force at different wheels.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Car with various labels describing the Sensify system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IW6zwPwuEXgQVxgcNc9SYsABWdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967005/BREMBO_SENSIFY_BRAKE_SYSTEM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Brembo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Brembo Sensify system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HevVSV"&gt;Despite the digital footprint with AI and Sensify, the physical mechanics have more of a presence compared to the software in the Sensify system, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/brembo-eyes-startup-deals-software-takes-bigger-role-brakes-2021-10-25/"&gt;according to Brembo chief executive Daniele Schillaci&lt;/a&gt;. The exec told &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;“the mechanic and software contents will soon be equivalent and by the end of the decade software will become predominant in braking systems.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce9huo"&gt;The company plans to open a technology lab in Silicon Valley by the end of the year to further its digital strategies. Brembo says, “Data collection is leveraged to improve the driver experience and allows the system to be constantly updated,” but how it will handle questions like privacy and security of that collected data is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfSICM"&gt;One of Sensify’s benefits is adapting to driving styles, adjusting to weather and road conditions, and shorter locking times. Brembo also says its system will be cheaper over the life of a car because it removes brake fluid by adding electromechanical control, has lower maintenance costs, lower disc consumption, and lower or zero drag torque. In an electric or hybrid vehicle, better control of regenerative braking can help reduce the battery size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrCkoe"&gt;What happens when there is a hardware failure in that AI brain? In &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry-news-tech,-development-and-manufacturing/brembo-sensify-revolutionary-new-ai"&gt;a demo for &lt;em&gt;Autocar UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Brembo explained the system has two ECUs (electronic control units) that are connected as a fail-safe but send their commands separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es67ej"&gt;The system is set to be released in 2024. Brembo said that it’s designed to work on multiple car types like sedans, racecars, SUVs, and commercial vehicles, but it’s not clear how much it needs to be customized for each type.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 DIY screen replacements break Face ID unless you can microsolder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Em6G6QkVUlMXgnMLI0x9rZq4sSY=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096270/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSNvSN"&gt;Apple’s new iPhone 13 lineup might pack a lot of new features, but they now have a major restriction that makes it much harder for independent repair shops to replace broken screens. If you try to swap the screen, Face ID just won’t work — that is, unless you know how to microsolder and can successfully move a tiny microcontroller from the original screen to a new one, as detailed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F54829%2Fapples-new-screen-repair-trap-could-change-the-repair-industry-forever&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22764251%2Fiphone-13-screen-replacements-break-face-id-microsolder" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an article from &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPfobS"&gt;The change makes a very common replacement much more difficult for independent repair shops that may rely on screen repairs as a significant part of their business. Authorized Apple shops apparently don’t run into the problem, as they have access to software that “can make an iPhone 13 accept a new screen with a few clicks,” according to &lt;em&gt;iFixit.&lt;/em&gt; But many indie shops aren’t part of Apple’s official Independent Repair Provider program, which reportedly has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;invasive terms&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them to have to try and find a way to repair iPhone screens on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUwr1"&gt;If you want to see just how involved the microcontroller switch is, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MXlhsThmM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from iCorrect. The repair is a multi-stage process that looks to take some time and require special equipment. And it’s almost certainly impossible for most iPhone owners to try it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rni2SA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9MXlhsThmM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WmnXtR"&gt;Apple has steadily been pushing people away from repairs done by indie shops through ominous warnings shown after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776965/iphone-xs-max-xr-battery-service-third-party-repair"&gt;battery swaps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884287/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-display-screen-replacement-verification-warning"&gt;screen replacements&lt;/a&gt; for some iPhones. But the situation with Face ID breaking on an iPhone 13 means that people who want a screen repair don’t have many great options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu0v2F"&gt;An authorized repair &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement"&gt;can be expensive&lt;/a&gt;, as is paying for AppleCare Plus for &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/support/products/iphone/"&gt;reduced screen repair prices&lt;/a&gt;. But when the alternatives include finding an indie shop that has the capability to pull off the delicate microcontroller swap, getting a screen replacement but sacrificing Face ID, or just living with a broken screen, paying up for an authorized repair might feel like the best option, even if it is the worst for your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFfgB9"&gt;Apple didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber prices are still way up, so the company is bringing back carpooling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber and Lyft sign in windshield of car, Queens, New York" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w53xIiLeEaXKnbZ6HbgYN0jT3t0=/0x168:4032x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70096233/1310967778.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXDYIM"&gt;Uber is preparing to relaunch its carpooling service as a way to combat price increases, officials said in a call with investors. Uber Pool was shuttered in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and remained so even as vaccines became widely available and customers returned to the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk8K6U"&gt;But that could soon change, according to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who hinted that a new shared rides product could be released soon. Along with its rival Lyft, Uber has been struggling to recover from the pandemic, as drivers fled the platform, wait times increased, and the cost of rides soared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJHwj"&gt;“We are launching an Uber shared pool product,” Khosrowshahi said. “We have been investing for years in a high-capacity product, which is looking more and more attractive as it relates to a unit economic basis, where that can bring the price significantly lower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XvMe5I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber’s prices are up 20 percent compared to last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRT2NX"&gt;Uber’s prices are up 20 percent compared to last year, slightly less than they were over the summer but still relatively steep compared to pre-pandemic prices. Introducing a low-cost carpooling service will help ease the demand for Uber’s main ride-hailing products, and hopefully bring those prices down more, Khosrowshahi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZhhyE"&gt;Uber Pool, the service that matches up to three riders in one car based on their destinations, was one of the cheapest options on the company’s platform. But drivers hated it, complaining about low customer ratings, an inefficient algorithm, and roundabout directions that tend to annoy riders despite the low fare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmEa2f"&gt;COVID-19 put a halt to the practice of strangers sharing the backseat of a car. Cities like New York actually banned shared trips in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Lyft also suspended its Lyft Line carpooling service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gk4kWV"&gt;When Uber Pool comes back, it may look different than the pre-pandemic version. Khosrowshahi hinted that it could be more like an employee shuttle service using Uber’s matching technology that the company can sell to its corporate client. A spokesperson called the employee shuttle a “separate effort” from the carpooling service, but declined to share more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HCQxd"&gt;That likely won’t affect the price of an Uber ride in the near term, though. Khosrowshahi acknowledged that the company is currently involved in “a giant pricing experiment that no one wanted to get into.” The company will continue to struggle with supply and demand problems as the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGb1Km"&gt;But Uber reported that its Q3 gross bookings, or the amount of money it takes in before paying drivers, reached an all-time high of $23.1 billion, up 57 percent year over year, despite a 20 percent increase in prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj9Rcy"&gt;“We’re seeing that as cities reopened, people start using the product,” Khosrowshahi said, “and they use our product a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
