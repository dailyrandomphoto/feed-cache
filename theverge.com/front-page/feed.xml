    <title>League of Legends: Wild Rift’s open beta comes to North America in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mC1-8yIxyOKZnXTaCAQFGRaR8wI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638333/wr_katarina_model.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4EYKC"&gt;Fans in North America will be able to play &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; on their phones very soon. Today, at a big event detailing what 2021 will look like for &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;, developer Riot revealed that &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274419/league-of-legends-wild-rift-gameplay-trailer-mobile-console"&gt;the mobile and console version of the game&lt;/a&gt; — will launch in open beta in the Americas starting in March. It’s not clear what platforms the beta will be available on, but previous open betas were primarily on Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXoTtQ"&gt;Additionally, Riot outlined its plans to support &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift &lt;/em&gt;throughout the year. That includes regular events like a Lunar New Year festival in February, a ranked season that kicks off in some regions this week, and the addition of around two new characters each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nzT0Q"&gt;The other big reveal from the event relates to Riot’s esports ambitions. &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is arguably the biggest competitive game in the world right now, and Riot is trying to do something similar for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612562/valorant-champions-tour-esports-2021"&gt;its tactical shooter &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So it should come as no surprise that the developer now says it’s looking to build out esports scenes for its trio of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs: &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqYCQt"&gt;Competitive mobile games like &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Brawl Stars&lt;/em&gt; are some of the most popular in the world, so it makes a lot of sense that Riot would try something similar with its smartphone titles, however there aren’t a lot of details on what the scenes will look like just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTrJHq"&gt;Meanwhile, the developer also announced that this year’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship will be held in Shenzhen, China. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;Last year’s event took place in Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision will premiere with two episodes on Disney Plus </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E0upwZJ3iihIwQ3GwYHEeGckdLw=/150x0:1050x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638307/wandavision_new.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K56vQJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is Marvel Studios’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168373/wandavision-trailer-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;first big Disney Plus release&lt;/a&gt;, and the show will circumvent Disney’s typical episode release structure by premiering two episodes at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8kTG6"&gt;The first two episodes of the show will premiere together on January 15th, with the third episode premiering a week later on January 22nd. Normally, Disney only releases one episode per week. There are exceptions: National Geographic shows have released more episodes at once. Most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mandalorian"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; first two episodes came out three days apart, but that was due to Disney Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963172/disney-plus-subscribers-10-million-star-wars-marvel-pixar-launch"&gt;launching on a Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and new episodes airing Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gv5TZN"&gt;Why are Disney and Marvel Studios releasing two episodes at once? No idea! The company didn’t give a reason in the &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/wandavision-two-episodes-premiere-confirmed-marvel-disney-plus-reelase-date/"&gt;press release sent out today&lt;/a&gt;, but there are a couple of assumptions we can make. Since the show centers on both Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), maybe each has their own episode that works better in a pairing? Considering the show is a little more abstract than other series, perhaps Disney is concerned the pilot would underwhelm or leave people confused, so teed up a second one for fans to play immediately after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1b1NXo"&gt;Regardless of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Disney is doing it, the fact is Marvel will provide two, half-hour episodes for people to stream on January 15th. If the remaining seven episodes are released weekly after that, &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;will conclude on March 5th. Marvel Studio’s next show, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328889/falcon-winter-soldier-delay-disney-plus-marvel-studios-avengers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;premiere on March 19th&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel Studios’ first theatrical release since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20734621/disney-record-breaking-2019-box-office-avengers-endgame-lion-king-aladdin-avatar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2019, is slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;hit theaters on May 7th&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it stays there (it all depends on how many theaters are open and if people are going back to theaters en masse by that date) is unclear right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCmPZ3"&gt;A full synopsis for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;can be read below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MTtRB5"&gt;The series is a blend of classic television and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which Wanda Maximoff and Vision — two super-powered beings living idealized suburban lives — begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Kensington’s SD5700T Thunderbolt 4 dock has all the ports you could need</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Kensington SD5700T seen from above on top of a white carpet." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sI-Vw_eNFk3iPKBt6J6tB1n4q0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638249/mchin190402_4357_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plug it in, and you’re good to go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svlsPV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21317513/intel-thunderbolt-4-standard-docks-cables-usb4-accessories-port-usbc"&gt;Thunderbolt 4 is here&lt;/a&gt;, and so is the first fully powered Thunderbolt 4 docking station. Kensington’s SD5700T includes a whopping 11 ports, 90W of power delivery, and transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps. It provides either one 8K output at 30 Hz or two 4K outputs at 60 Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGy9rr"&gt;Make no mistake: This is a fancy dock. It’s listed for &lt;a href="https://store.kensington.com/collections/docking-stations-1/products/sd5700t-thunderbolt%E2%84%A24-dual-4k-docking-station-with-90w-pd-win-mac"&gt;$289.99 on Kensington’s site&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re the kind of person who uses an elaborate desk setup with multiple monitors and peripherals, and you have the money to spend, this could be a good choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj4aoO"&gt;If you look at the most recent Thunderbolt 4 laptop releases, you’ll probably notice that some of them have... sparse port selections. That’s par for the course as laptops get thinner. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, only has two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one audio jack, and one microSD card reader. (And one of those ports will sometimes need to be occupied by the charger.) If you’ve decided to buy one of the XPS 13 models (which is a good choice — they’re great), and you want to use an external monitor, peripherals like a mouse and keyboard, or an Ethernet connection, you’re going to need a dock of some kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wanH6S"&gt;That doesn’t mean you need the SD5700T — Thunderbolt 4 ports will still support a cheaper Thunderbolt 3 dock if you already have one lying around. But I do think the SD5700T is worth shelling out for if you need more connectivity and value Thunderbolt 4 functionality. It essentially packs a full home-office setup into one very portable box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUC3qr"&gt;The dock is also compatible with Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks that are running macOS Big Sur. It worked just fine with my 2019 MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Kensington SD5700T from the back, on top of a windowsill." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hkXF94roV1xYp67Hte9FUkJOq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216121/mchin190402_4357_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three USB-A ports, three USB-C ports, a power port, and Ethernet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zGbpaN"&gt;Besides the aforementioned Thunderbolt 3-enabled MacBook Pro, I’ve been using the SD5700T with a Thunderbolt 4-enabled Acer Swift 5 as well. I’m someone who often needs to plug in way more mice, cameras, drives, headphones, and other thingamabobs than my laptops allow, so my workspace is often covered in a mess of dongles and docks. The SD5700T provides a heck of a lot more connectivity than docks of this size that I’ve used in the past, and it’s made my life a lot easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvcsQO"&gt;With a single Thunderbolt cable (which is included), Kensington 5D5700T owners have access to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QhMyMA"&gt;Four Thunderbolt 4 ports (with transfer speeds up to 40Gbps and dual 4K video output)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ppA3sY"&gt;Four USB-A ports (one 5V / 1.5A charging port on the front and three Gen 2 @ 10Gbps ports on the back)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q7iNR4"&gt;One Gigabit Ethernet port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nRz8Lp"&gt;One audio combo jack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3PfwM9"&gt;One UHS-II SD 4.0 card reader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qrhVGs"&gt;90W power delivery (regardless of the number of connected devices)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="7oEvDT"&gt;Obviously, use cases vary, but I really can’t think of anything else that the vast majority of people would need. And remember, these aren’t all you get — plugging the dock into one port frees up the other ports on your laptop that might otherwise be occupied by a charger, monitor adapters, and other peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Kensington SD5700T from the front, on a windowsill." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ti_jTwhQCkbwBt-Ld2LC8pRG55s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22216120/mchin190402_4357_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One USB-A port, one USB-C port, one audio jack, one SD card reader, and the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fZnXI3"&gt;The SD5700T didn’t require any expertise whatsoever to set up: I plugged the dock into the wall, plugged in all my odds and ends, turned it on, and then connected it to the laptop. And that was it — it just worked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGfxDf"&gt;Everything I connected worked just fine. I didn’t experience any bugs or performance issues. The one thing I’d like to see is a way to disconnect the dock as a whole with a single click. Currently, you have to eject every connected device individually before unplugging a laptop from the SD5700T, which can be a pain if you have a bunch of things plugged in. There are third-party apps that can make this happen, but some companies like &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3597053/corsair-tbt100-thunderbolt-3-dock-review.html"&gt;Corsair&lt;/a&gt; provide ejection utilities optimized for their own docks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NuJIn"&gt;Final observation: It’s not a bad-looking dock. It’s got a nice finish that’s shiny but unobtrusive — nothing that will stand out on your desk or turn any heads in the office. At 0.96 pounds (0.435 kg) and 7.68 x 2.95 x 1.18 inches (195 x 75 x 30 mm), it’s also easy to carry around if you need to move your workspace. You can slip it in into a purse or backpack without a problem (though the 180W brick is a bit clunky). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwYFuc"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://store.kensington.com/collections/docking-stations-1/products/sd5700t-thunderbolt%E2%84%A24-dual-4k-docking-station-with-90w-pd-win-mac"&gt;preorder the Kensington SD5700T now&lt;/a&gt;, and it will ship in the second week of January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quibi’s library will live on through the Roku Channel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vp175mS4jBWT0Pd2LJ0yGr3oENs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637968/acastro_200403_3960_quibi_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZ1U80"&gt;Roku has acquired defunct streaming service Quibi’s library of content, the &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/en-gb/quibi"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Content from the short-form service will appear on the Roku Channel for free at some point in 2021, though the company hasn’t announced an exact date for its arrival. Roku did not disclose how much it paid for the content in its announcement, but &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-acquires-rights-to-quibi-s-content-11610116056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it paid “significantly less” than $100 million for the shows. The deal was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22212447/quibi-roku-content-deal-acquisition-report-wsj"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month in a separate &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-nears-deal-to-buy-rights-to-quibis-content-11609725389"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvGtFl"&gt;Despite Quibi’s failure, its content was star-studded. Roku’s announcement says the Quibi content it has licensed will feature stars including “Idris Elba, Kevin Hart, Liam Hemsworth, Anna Kendrick, Nicole Richie, Chrissy Teigen, Lena Waithe, and many others.” Over 75 shows will be available as part of the deal, Roku says. Roku, one of the leading hardware companies in the streaming space, is trying to push more into software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq8SZQ"&gt;Acquiring Quibi’s shows and placing them exclusively within The Roku Channel (a free offering from the company) will be used to drive watch time on the platform and possibly increase the amount of ad inventory Roku can sell. As competition in the hardware space increases, finding new legs up over competition — in this case, original content — is a must. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6oiMOJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME FROM MY SLUMBER! &lt;a href="https://t.co/GD99MlkCzj"&gt;https://t.co/GD99MlkCzj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quibi (@Quibi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Quibi/status/1347552601487724544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQkrpk"&gt;Although Quibi’s content was primarily designed to be consumed on mobile devices, it was previously possible to watch its content on TVs thanks to native apps that were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526039/quibi-apple-tv-android-fire-apps-trouble"&gt;released for Apple TV, Android TV, and Fire TV&lt;/a&gt;, albeit months after the service’s launch. Quibi content could also be streamed to compatible TVs via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271346/quibi-apple-ios-airplay-google-chromecast-june-tv"&gt;AirPlay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285760/quibi-google-chromecast-support-feature-launch-apple-airplay-tv-shows"&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/whats-on/the-roku-channel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku’s website&lt;/a&gt; notes that the Roku Channel is available on Roku’s players, select smart TVs, mobile apps, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zuXBr"&gt;Quibi’s content will be exclusive to Roku for the same two-year exclusivity window originally agreed with content creators, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, after which Roku will keep the right to show the content until 2027. However, Roku will reportedly have to present the shows in their original form, and won’t be able to string multiple short-form episodes together to create content of a more traditional length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VqoGP"&gt;The Roku deal comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;Quibi officially announced it was shutting down&lt;/a&gt; in October after running for a little over six months. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix"&gt;app failed for myriad reasons&lt;/a&gt;, despite managing to raise $1.75 billion in funding prior to its launch largely thanks to hype and dealmaking from its high-profile leadership, former HP exec Meg Whitman and former Disney chairman and movie producer Jeffrey Katzenberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p7vooK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the final days of Quibi","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21559189/quibi-final-days-streaming-platform-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oVxt62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Vox Media has a deal with Quibi to produce a show, and there were early talks about a &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; show as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfEIp2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th, 10:43AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with the amount that Roku reportedly paid for the shows and more details from the deal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Pantry is being discontinued as Amazon consolidates its grocery delivery services</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iHlh6_mi7HPwya9Ag0o3xKIUY2E=/71x0:830x506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637964/Woman_Unpacking_Amazon_Prime_Pantry_Box.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NMII1t"&gt;Amazon has announced that it’s discontinued its Amazon Pantry (originally known as Prime Pantry) service, instead rolling those household goods and shelf-stable pantry items into the main Amazon website where they can be ordered alongside the rest of Amazon’s products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZJUAK"&gt;Originally &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-23-amazon-prime-pantry.html"&gt;launched back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, Pantry worked differently from most Amazon orders. Instead of following the usual Amazon delivery rules, Pantry orders charged customers a flat $5.99 shipping fee per box of groceries, which could be filled with up to 45 pounds of products or up to four cubic feet of stuff (whichever limit customers reached first). The focus of the program was to make it easier to stock up on everyday products that would otherwise be bulky or expensive to ship, like bottled water, paper goods, flour, canned food items, boxes of cereal, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcTvTl0qdSG8TI2q7yYajtWkiZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22221829/Screen_Shot_2021_01_08_at_8.37.18_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xg17Zu"&gt;Amazon would later slightly change up how Prime Pantry worked &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/amazon-transitions-its-prime-pantry-service-monthly-membership"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, shifting the service to a $5 per month subscription on top of its regular Prime fees. That price would offer unlimited Pantry orders each month, provided that customers were ordering at least $40 worth of merchandise. Orders below that $40 limit (or for customers, Prime or otherwise, who hadn’t subscribed to Pantry), would instead be charged a flat $7.99 fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WWZupY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxNqCCfdtvg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJNo9P"&gt;Despite the fact that Amazon is removing Prime Pantry, the company’s grocery delivery ambitions are still stronger than ever. Amazon now owns Whole Foods, an entire chain of grocery stores, and has started to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;its own Amazon Fresh-branded stores&lt;/a&gt; as well. And the company still offers its Fresh and Whole Foods delivery service for Amazon Prime members (having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937862/amazon-fresh-free-delivery-fee-prime-members"&gt;previously removed&lt;/a&gt; the $15 per month subscription fee for that in 2019) that provides grocery delivery in over 2,000 cities in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igeXvY"&gt;In many ways, the original Pantry program was designed to help Amazon compete better with traditional grocery stores — but now that Amazon owns and operates those very same stores (complete with Amazon Prime delivery), the consolidation of Pantry back into the larger Amazon site makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams is getting a new Dynamic View feature in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xr_GYD1b4p-tOqZLyVzpte1CBk=/47x0:853x537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637868/dynamicview.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9XbVv"&gt;Microsoft is updating its Teams service with a new Dynamic View in March. This new view allows Teams users to share content side by side with participants. It looks ideally positioned for meetings where someone is presenting a slide deck or if participants are watching a live event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8l3il"&gt;Dynamic content like earnings reports, slide decks, or videos can be displayed alongside other speakers. Currently in Teams, video feeds of other participants are tiny when people are screen sharing or presenting decks. Microsoft’s Gallery View for Teams will optimize itself automatically with this new view and allow participants to personalize the view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eNlOOo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6751791000890462209?compact=true" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W9H2R0"&gt;It will also more clearly highlight active speakers, people who have virtually raised their hands, and allow participants to pin people next to dynamic content. Originally unveiled all the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;back in July&lt;/a&gt;, this new Dynamic View will be available to all Microsoft Teams users in March, according to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Froadmap%3Ffilters%3D%26searchterms%3Ddynamic%252Cview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s 365 product roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6PQUB"&gt;Microsoft Teams usage has soared over the past 10 months of the pandemic, with the service now being used by more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;115 million people daily&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has been adding features to Teams on what feels like a monthly basis, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450502/microsoft-teams-together-mode-breakout-rooms-custom-layouts-features"&gt;virtual breakout rooms&lt;/a&gt; appearing in December alongside an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754862/microsoft-teams-calling-update-carplay-onedrive-recording-features"&gt;improved calling experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2021 Moto G Stylus, Power, and Play focus on big batteries, bigger screens, and low prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhVmEsZiIWiYSTFvxd9za-92OnQ=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637858/moto_phones.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Left to right) The Moto G Play, G Stylus, and G Power.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYxogU"&gt;Motorola is kicking off 2021 with refreshes for its midrange Moto G lineup of phones with new versions of the Moto G Power, Moto G Stylus, and Moto G Play that promise low prices and days of battery life across the board. There’s also a new member of the Motorola One family called the Motorola One 5G Ace, which, at $399, takes the crown as Motorola’s cheapest 5G phone yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcDY5p"&gt;Once again, Motorola is set on offering an almost dizzying amount of low-priced phones that differ in price by just $30 to $50. The new Moto G Play will cost $169.99; the Moto G Power will offer $199.99 (for a 3GB of RAM / 32GB of storage model) $249.99 (for 4GB / 64GB) configurations; the Moto G Stylus will cost $299.99; and the Motorola One 5G Ace will cost $399.99. It’s a strategy that ensures there’s a phone at nearly every price point you could imagine, although it does make it slightly harder to choose between similar devices at such similar prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxL49Q"&gt;Motorola is sticking with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;same names&lt;/a&gt; for its new 2021 lineup — sadly, the days of the numerically differentiated Moto G models appear to have ended for good with 2019’s Moto G7 lineup. But the new phones do offer improvements big and small compared to their 2020 predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0FZt5Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10271765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uDNUTA"&gt;The Moto G Play seems like the toughest sell of the bunch. While the $169 price tag is intriguing, the paltry 720p resolution — stretched across a comparatively huge 6.5-inch panel — raises concerns, as does the year-old Snapdragon 460 processor that’s markedly less powerful than either of the other two new 2021 Moto G phones. That’s especially true given that Qualcomm has already announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;Snapdragon 480&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to be twice as fast and adds more premium features like 5G to the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fC1P55"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A midrange phone at every price point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PLMt53"&gt;There are some bright spots, too. The 2021 G Play has 3GB of RAM (putting it in a better position performance-wise than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286687/motorola-moto-e-2020-g-fast-review-price-specs-features"&gt;last year’s $149 Moto E&lt;/a&gt;) and a massive 5,000mAh battery that Motorola says should be good for up to three days on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bgeixj"&gt;The new G Power and G Stylus aren’t as similar as last year’s models. Where the 2020 models offered the same processor, screen, and design, the new models are distinctly different phones. The G Power offers a 5,000mAh battery, a 720p 6.6-inch display, and weaker Snapdragon 662, but the G Stylus makes an argument for its higher price tag with a stylus, a larger and higher-resolution 1080p 6.8-inch panel, and a more powerful Snapdragon 678 processor. (It does go down a notch in battery, only offering a 4,000mAh battery that’s good for up to two days off a charge.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVKMcD"&gt;The larger G Stylus also offers 4GB of RAM by default (unlike the G Power, which has both 3GB and 4GB models) and has more storage (128GB versus the G Power’s choice of either 32GB or 64GB). You also get some camera improvements on the G Stylus — while both phones feature a 48-megapixel main sensor (which shoots quad-pixel 12-megapixel shots), a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, the G Stylus also adds an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a better selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5yCvpYhyX9jjiomXuamGFMUeLMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220797/moto_one_5g_ace.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LGWjIi"&gt;Lastly, there’s the Motorola One 5G Ace, which (as the name indicates) isn’t quite in the same category as the other phones here. At $399, it’s Motorola’s cheapest 5G phone yet. And the weaker Snapdragon 750G 5G, downgraded cameras, and slower refresh rate display leave the One 5G Ace as more of a lower-priced version of the $499 Motorola One 5G that the company released last year than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k83wLD"&gt;All four new phones will be available unlocked through direct retailers on January 14th, with preorders starting today. Additionally, several of the new phones will also be released through major carriers in the future: the Moto G Play and Motorola One 5G Ace through AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, while the G Power will be sold by just Verizon. The G Stylus, meanwhile, will skip the major US carriers entirely, although Boost Mobile, Cricket, Consumer Cellular, and Republic Wireless will offer it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku says Roku TV was best-selling smart TV OS in North America for 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VaQVMYdnpaEgYItJccbhqzVEbxM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637554/cwelch_181128_3103_0677_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAmeFF"&gt;Roku says its Roku TV line was the top-selling smart TV OS in the US and Canada throughout all of 2020, using NPD data to illustrate the company’s powerful standing. “Roku TV held 38 percent of market share in the US and 31 percent in Canada, based on available data from January 5th through December 26th, 2020, maintaining the lead spot in both regions,” the company said in a press release today. That would signify that Samsung’s Tizen has fallen to second place. (Samsung is still the most popular individual TV maker, however, since Roku TV is divided among brands like TCL, Hisense, and others.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lk3CLx"&gt;Roku attributes the success of Roku TV to its simple user interface, vast app catalog, and a wide range of TV sizes at appealing prices. TCL has really carved out a reputation as the best choice for picture quality among all the companies making Roku TVs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYgA8Z"&gt;In line with the strong momentum, Roku is also using CES 2021 to announce that partners for its “Roku TV Ready” initiative will soon be able to release wireless soundbars for Roku TV sets. Roku has a new reference design for the wireless soundbar, which connects to Roku TVs over Wi-Fi. Customers won’t have to worry about any lip sync problems, as latency is communicated between hardware devices to ensure proper A/V synchronization. Roku essentially picks the brains and processing for the reference design but leaves other choices — like enclosure design and the drivers / speakers used — to manufacturers. You’ll be able to quickly set up and adjust settings on these wireless soundbars right from the Roku TV’s settings menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uoehv6"&gt;Separate from this, Element is joining the Roku TV Ready program and plans to release a 2.0 soundbar and 2.1 soundbar / subwoofer combo later in 2021. Roku says it plans to expand the program to other countries throughout the year and will announce partners as that effort progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEFPCj"&gt;Roku’s continued success and influence have led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;standoffs with streaming service providers&lt;/a&gt; in recent months; it took right up until the release of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; for the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/21272058/hbo-max-roku-watch-wonder-woman-1984-movies-amazon-fire-stream-comcast-warnermedia"&gt;work out a deal with WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; to get HBO Max on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The JLab JBuds Frames are open-ear headphones you clip to your glasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqzF79mcQiHk7RXfUs8Jy52vA4g=/0x500:3000x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68637359/JLab_JBuds_Frames_glasses_greyed_out.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KpPQna"&gt;JLab is introducing a new Bluetooth audio gadget designed to be clipped onto your existing glasses or sunglasses. The JBuds Frames are two modules with downward-firing speakers you position right outside your ears. They are part of a resurgent trend of open-ear audio that has usually been the domain of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21429753/bose-frames-tenor-soprano-tempo-audio-sunglasses-announced-price"&gt;Bluetooth-enabled sunglasses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706156/aftershokz-aeropex-bone-conduction-headphones-wireless-review"&gt;bone-conducting bands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90kFsW"&gt;They’re retailing for just $50, which fits in with another trend: JLab’s history of offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/25/17046000/jlab-epic-sport-earbuds-workout-headphones-review"&gt;surprisingly inexpensive headphones&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, those headphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/9/12404118/bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-running-jbl-beats-jaybird"&gt;outperform their price point&lt;/a&gt; and so the company is hoping it can pull that trick off again by undercutting Bose, Amazon, Aftershokz, and others. However, so far, there’s a fairly low ceiling on audio quality for open-ear headphones — so don’t expect audiophile quality regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9Uy0d"&gt;The JBuds Frames are two largish modules which clip to the temples of the glasses you already own. Unlike integrated solutions, there’s no attempt whatsoever to hide the fact that you’ve got headphones in your eyeglasses. They ship with multiple sizes of clips so they can fit to more sizes of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SdZXKfECZrh-okO8_n8vU_4DSMw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220878/JLab_JBuds_Frames_on_sunglasses_with_blue_lenses.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s8YrPE"&gt;For audio, each unit has a 16mm driver that JLab says won’t be “heard by those close by.” That’s the basic premise of open-ear audio: although the audio is playing just outside your ears, it is directed in such a way that only you will hear it. You might not get the greatest fidelity, but your ears won’t be covered so you can pay attention to the world around you if you are out exercising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UWrU8"&gt;The JBuds Frames have an IPX4 water resistance rating, so they should be good for the rain or sweat. They have buttons to control volume, accept or reject calls, and switch EQ settings. JLab says they can be used as a pair or independently, if you just want to attach and use one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OtxXtn2muWH83uX3W4AzuD6sf6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220877/JLab_Frames_included_accessories___USB_to_magnetic_pin_connection_cable.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="thPw6Q"&gt;Battery life is rated at over eight hours of audio playback — and it ought to be good, given the size of these modules. Rather than coming with a charging case, they ship with a special cable that splits into two magnetic charging points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amXCb2"&gt;I recently reviewed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Amazon Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; and found having open-ear access to audio throughout the day to be really convenient. In theory, the JLab Frames would offer that same convenience without asking me to change my eyeglasses. There’s competition, however, in the form of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215281/base-sport-open-earbuds-ambient-noise-workout"&gt;recently announced (and much more expensive) Bose Sport Open Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which rest on your ears instead of your glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV2CXU"&gt;Both are going to be available in the early spring of 2021, so we’ll have a chance to test both of them out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbqLyy"&gt;Kohler has revealed a new smart bath that lets you use an app, or your voice, to fill up the water. That by itself seems pretty handy to me, but depending on which model you buy, you can elevate your bathing experience by changing the color of lights around the tub or even &lt;em&gt;adding some fog&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Noatfb"&gt;You’ll also be able to establish preset routines to turn on features in a certain order so you can set your bath exactly the way you want it. For example, you can have the tub fill itself up to a specified level and a certain temperature, and once that’s done, add some fog or turn on some aromatherapy, all with a voice command to Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrvHF6"&gt;Take look at the Stillness Bath for yourself in this footage provided by Kohler. I gotta say, it seems like a really relaxing tub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vqbiGz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Kohler Broll|100112" data-volume-uuid="664865c9f" data-volume-id="100112" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-73" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ilmNEb"&gt;If you want this luxurious bath experience in your own home, though, it won’t come cheap. Just to control the temperature and depth of the water, you’re looking at a model with an estimated price of $8,698. If you want the “Experience Tower” that lets you activate fog and aromatherapy, that’ll cost around $10,998. Both of those models will be available in July. The version that also has floor grates for overflow and the lights has an estimated price of $15,998, and it will be available in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9v0kR4"&gt;While the Stillness Bath seems neat, I have to say that it isn’t quite as awe-inspiring as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170575/kohler-konnect-bathroom-smart-gadgets-numi-intelligent-toilet-ces-2019"&gt;Kohler’s Numi 2.0 Intelligent Toilet&lt;/a&gt;, which has surround sound speakers, ambient lighting, and Alexa voice controls. It earned &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18177016/verge-ces-2019-awards-best-tv-laptop-gaming-device"&gt;“Most CES” award&lt;/a&gt; for CES 2019. However, it appears you still can’t buy the toilet just yet — though you can sign up to be notified when it’s available on &lt;a href="https://www.smarthome.kohler.com/smart-intelligent-toilets-numi2"&gt;Kohler’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
