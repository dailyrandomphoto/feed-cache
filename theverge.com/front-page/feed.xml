    <title>A former pro is helping figure skating look more authentic than ever</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;On Ice Perspectives&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vW2DkD"&gt;On TV, ice skating often looks like a sport stuck in time. Cameras aren’t hanging from wires above the action or placed close to the ice for a dynamic look at skaters zipping by. Instead, a few stationary cameras planted around a rink flip from one view to the next when a better angle is available. It can be dull to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5uadz"&gt;But far more exciting and intimate ways to shoot ice skating have been emerging on social media, and one person in particular has made a name synonymous with turning the sport into something spectacular to watch: Jordan Cowan, under the name On Ice Perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fN0d7"&gt;Plenty of others try to make videos similar to those Cowan uploads to his channels. What gives his content the edge is that he was a professional skater who represented Team USA at international competitions, competing six times at the US Figure Skating Championships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jucdL1"&gt;Other professional skaters trust him on the ice because he’s one of them. Cowan’s ability to skate lets him stay in-step with skaters and keep them in his camera’s frame while speeding around a rink. Instead of following behind skaters, he’s usually along their path of flight, getting the best shot. In his videos, it’s easy to see a skater’s technique and exactly how they shift their weight with every move and transition. It’s pure fan service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="v4TuAc"&gt;Cowan visits rinks around the world to shoot with up-and-coming skaters, and present and former Olympic-level skaters alike. He’s uploaded more than 900 videos since the channel launched in 2018, and altogether, they’ve gathered over 25 million views across all platforms. Notably, former first lady &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleObama/status/1358863075663896582"&gt;Michelle Obama recently tweeted a video&lt;/a&gt; he made that shows Starr Andrews, a Team USA senior medalist, dancing to “Black Like Me” by Mickey Guyton. Recently, he’s been tapped to help shoot CBC’s &lt;em&gt;Battle of the Blades &lt;/em&gt;and ITV’s &lt;em&gt;Dancing on Ice&lt;/em&gt; programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NY3xSe"&gt;Cowan answered some questions over email to explain his technique, his tech, and his goals for On Ice Perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mr3qo9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCY8xx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you want to start On Ice Perspectives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCABeY"&gt;Looking at skating content on social media, I felt there was a gap between what I was seeing, and the truly inspiring content being captured in, say, the dance or gymnastics world. I wondered if someone with insider access, but also film and social media knowledge, could do for skating what several great dance videographers have done for the quality of dance content that we’re accustomed to seeing on TV and social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="py9G5z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qqIH9ez7d9A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJyJps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What tech do you use and what’s your workflow like? Do you use any custom gear that you’ve constructed yourself? And what’s on the horizon in terms of what tech you could use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdeuYT"&gt;The camera I use for the majority of the work you see on On Ice Perspectives is the Sony mirrorless A7III, on a DJI Ronin SC gimbal, with a Rode shotgun mic for sound. For editing I use Final Cut Pro X on a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoeAyp"&gt;I am constantly tinkering with and improving the equipment that makes up my workflow. I like to think that I’m the only person using some of the configurations I have evolved, but realistically, everything I use is standard and accessible by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RU9meD"&gt;When I film for network shows, I generally use a rig made for cinema cameras with large cinema lenses. At this point I can’t own a rig of that caliber, and since it is my goal to bring a cinematic edge to the videos I share, it is my eventual goal to own my own rig that I can use to produce that level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5II7s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve shared the tech that does work well for your rig, but what hasn’t worked as well as you’ve hoped? I’m sure in your early days there was some trial and error.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rg2pO7"&gt;I think creativity is born out of necessity, and necessity comes from limitations. My first gimbals were very basic, so when skating around a curve, for example, the horizon would start to roll, and I had to monitor that and manually compensate as I was plotting my next move. My newer gimbals are more powerful and precise, but I’d be lying if I don’t miss that charm of a gimbal that’s constantly rolling into a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ofBDXc749wE?t=41"&gt;Dutch angle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OpUB4TSJ5wpCT4IILi0fB_HPIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22332001/jordan4.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCIm0r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the viewer’s perspective, it seems like you really can have a connection with the skaters that you record. The footage feels almost eerily in-sync with their movements at times. Can you explain how you do this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePAe6u"&gt;I am lucky that I was a Team USA ice dancer, and as such, I have the built-in sixth sense that all skaters develop when training daily on the ice with world and Olympic champions. I often can’t answer why I know, at the moment, where to go to get a good angle of a subject, but I know it’s thanks to my training, and I am grateful for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXKczR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think the camera work during televised ice skating competitions leaves a lot to be desired. It’s very flat, and it can feel tough to be connected with the skaters during their dances. Is this something you’re trying to change with your shooting style?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z9kkl"&gt;Absolutely. When you are on the ice with elite skaters, you can feel the speed they create. The shapes their bodies make only fully make sense when seen against the perspective of where on the ice they have traveled. It’s just not possible to portray this with the traditional filming from the boards audiences are used to seeing in the media. I hope to give viewers a window to the feeling that being on the ice or at a live show gives you, and that has entirely informed how I choose to shoot. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iyWEgo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sorts of trends have emerged from your content? Are you seeing fans clinging to certain kinds of content more so than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Db9v2"&gt;It tends to be a routine made to music that breaks the traditional expectation of skating, like an ice dance team skating to Metallica or burlesque. It proved that skating as an art and dance form is linked to popular music, like most trends on the internet. The fact that it’s a sport as well makes it exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqzFbv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what point did you decide to build your channel into a business via Patreon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFENgK"&gt;I knew from the beginning that I didn’t want to charge skaters in order to be able to focus on building On Ice Perspectives. What I love about Patreon is that it gives viewers the chance to support not only the very significant costs associated with running the channel, but also to have a stake in the mission of creating unique skating content. Unlike a traditional sponsor, my patrons can donate just a few dollars and access the extra content shared there, all while making a very real impact on my ability to continue sharing skating content with the world. In a sense, Patreon allows patrons a greater connection to what I do with On Ice Perspectives, but also with the sport itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FYbEKg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fgegzg0x0-0?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=62&amp;amp;start=62" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XmfDz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your goals for On Ice Perspectives?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1OsbL"&gt;Honestly, I have so many. For the longest time I was focused on wanting to film the gala which follows the figure skating events at the Olympics, in a new and unique way. While I would still, of course, love to do this, my focus has shifted to wanting to produce livestreams and I hope, one day, a made-for-camera complete ice show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo is disclosing more autonomous vehicle data for research purposes</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3aZpp"&gt;Waymo is publicizing more data from its autonomous vehicles, which it says is for the benefit of the research community. Building on the trove of data it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20822755/waymo-self-driving-car-data-set-free-research"&gt;released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the Alphabet company is calling this latest batch “the largest interactive dataset yet released for research into behavior prediction and motion forecasting for autonomous driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHCpuD"&gt;This “motion dataset” includes over 100,000 segments, each around 20 seconds long, of objects like cars and people and their trajectories, as captured by Waymo’s sensor-laden vehicles. The company has included corresponding 3D maps and geographic details in each segment to provide researchers with context for their prediction modeling. In total, Waymo says it is releasing 570 hours of “unique data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7E0Hld"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A wide variety of road types in different urban environments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0rImvB"&gt;A wide variety of road types in different urban environments are featured, including San Francisco, Phoenix, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Seattle. Waymo says it included data mined specifically for its unique qualifications for research purposes, including “cyclists and vehicles sharing the roadway, cars quickly passing through a busy junction, or groups of pedestrians clustering on the sidewalk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKkg8w"&gt;Waymo also claims that its “perception boxes,” or the colored boxes used to distinguish different objects on the road, are “state of the art” and superior to other open-source datasets. “This is important because the better the perception system is at tracking the objects and agents in the motion data, the more accurate the resulting behavior prediction model will be at predicting what they are going to do,” writes Drago Anguelov, head of research at Waymo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjhoXy"&gt;To go along with the data dump, Waymo is also launching an open dataset challenge to encourage research teams in their work on behavior and prediction. There are four challenges: motion prediction, interaction prediction, real-time 3D detection, and real-time 2D detection. The winner of each challenge will receive $15,000, with second-place teams receiving $5,000 and third place $2,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7AjIA"&gt;Waymo isn’t the first company to release an open dataset. In March 2019, Aptiv &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2019/03/28/aptiv-releases-comprehensive-open-source-automated-vehicle-data-set/"&gt;became one of the first&lt;/a&gt; large AV operators to publicly release a set of its sensor data. Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, also released AV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18229397/uber-gm-cruise-av-visualization-open-source"&gt;visualization tools to the public&lt;/a&gt;. Argo, which is backed by Ford, has also released &lt;a href="https://groundtruthautonomy.com/introducing-argoverse-data-and-hd-maps-for-computer-vision-and-machine-learning-research-to-advance-self-driving-technology/"&gt;a dataset of HD maps called the “Argoverse.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hasselblad’s 907X 50C is absolutely slow and absolutely stunning</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A digital medium format vacation, if you will&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="et8RTa"&gt;Hasselblad’s latest digital camera, the 907X 50C, is a 740-gram metal box that can serve as a standalone medium format digital camera or as a digital back for Hasselblad V System cameras made from 1957 onward. At $6,400, it is the smallest digital medium format body Hasselblad has ever made, and it is filled with premium Hasselblad touches. But its responsive touchscreen, all-metal body, and satisfying leaf shutter don’t make up for its slow auto-focus or lack of a viewfinder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kg8OdD"&gt;Using the 907X takes patience and practice, but if you are willing to put in the time, the 907X’s 50mp CMOS medium format sensor paired with Hasselblad’s gorgeous color science can create stunning results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SSSTRt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10383015"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4vfhdD"&gt;I have gotten so used to the DSLR and mirrorless camera layouts: using my right thumb for most controls and having a firm grip around the battery compartment. Using the 907X is done mostly with the pointer finger, and the lack of a battery grip makes holding the metal box feel awkward and foreign at first. There is a grip you can buy for an additional $729 that provides two additional dials and four buttons along with a small joystick, but I really challenged myself to use the camera without this expensive mod. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVR7CF"&gt;There is a battery compartment that houses dual SD card slots on the right side of the camera, a USB-C port with a small door on the left, and the shutter button is under the lens mount around front. On the back, below the 3.2-inch articulating touchscreen, are the flash, headphone, and mic ports, all cleverly hidden under a rubber door. Although all of the ports are covered, Hasselblad makes no claims about the camera being weather-sealed. If you plan on taking this out in any sort of precipitation, you do it at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d6SSvlAA7QSA6KGLLthgPPuDkw4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355639/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0009_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a rubber door that covers the flash, headphone, and mic ports on the base of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ia6pppqDgT64YO4dMRz-qKwF97k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355637/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0006_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are five rubber buttons under the 3.2-inch articulating touchscreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JyTv6R8qOjK6w-0thwOnJz91cqg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355638/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small door hides the USB-C port on the left side of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fVF89Q"&gt;Anyone who has spent time with Hasselblad’s traditional medium format film cameras will likely feel comfortable with the 907X’s layout. Otherwise, using this camera feels like stepping into a whole new world. To start, the lack of a handgrip leads me to support the weight of the camera on my right palm with my left hand gripping the lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb4VdH"&gt;Next, there is only one dial on the whole system. It runs around the shutter button, which is on the front of the camera. Spin this dial to adjust f-stop or hold down the small button on the right side of the camera while spinning the dial to adjust shutter speed. All other controls are on the touchscreen around the back, which is, fortunately, very responsive and smooth, quite a departure from the first touchscreen experience Hasselblad shipped on the X1D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlkqIT"&gt;Lastly, there is no viewfinder on the base model. As an ode to the waist-level cameras of medium format past, the 907X’s back screen can articulate 90 degrees up so that you are looking down and into the camera instead of through the camera at your subject. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euW-b2QFH8NYylIIlsF6IcporDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355634/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0002_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 90-degree articulating screen allows you to look down and into the camera at your subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pi4n5g"&gt;The 907X forces you to use it in a particular way. From the button placement to the lack of a handle to the articulating screen, there is very little about this camera that I was accustomed to. When attempting to take photos walking down the street, for example, I couldn’t just whip the camera up and nab a shot of a passing cyclist or the cool shoes of someone walking toward me. I would have to pull the screen out first, then dial in the ISO on a touchscreen, then adjust my hand to reach the shutter and f-stop dial on the front all before I could snap the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2Xu90"&gt;Another speed bump in using the 907X is the focus system. It’s contrast based, and it is slow. When pointing the camera at a subject, the pre-production Hasselblad XCD 80mm lens I was shooting with would hunt for at least a few seconds and often not be able to grab focus at all. If I had a limited window for capturing the scene I wanted, I simply wouldn’t even try because I knew I was likely to miss it. For me, missing the shot is more frustrating than just not trying in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZG9Zs"&gt;This was incredibly difficult to adapt to at first. I spent the first few days with the 907X constantly feeling like I missed the shot, that I wasn’t moving quick enough. And then I put the camera on a tripod, and I realized why it didn’t need a handle and why it isn’t in the hands of street photographers. This camera is not for the quick take; it’s for the thought-out, the particularly placed, the well-crafted shot. This camera does not chase the moment; it invites the moment to come to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2F2Ga"&gt;It is worth noting the 907X has one of the simplest menus, especially compared to the byzantine and terrible menu systems of Sony. There are five physical rubber buttons under the 3.2-inch touchscreen, but otherwise, navigating the camera’s menu system is done completely by touch. The main menu consists of 11 vectored icons that lead to deeper settings. It’s all very intuitive and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RyowpLz7Io6oyYotZFx-4kgWr-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355646/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hasselblad 907X has a 50-megapixel CMOS medium format sensor that can be used as a digital back on most Hasselblad V system cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1LOE0zR7GODivVEDcLsSo3rzblU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355643/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0014_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The all-metal body has a premium feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_0ZtLzLaDcXSuJ1Q95DBMY6D6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355641/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0012_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The only dial on the 907X runs around the shutter button on the front of the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIe4Y3"&gt;The magic of the 907X is in its 50-megapixel CMOS medium format sensor, which is capable of capturing 8272 x 6200 pixels. It’s larger than a full-frame camera’s sensor, but not quite as big as if you compared it to a medium format film camera. It’s also getting up there in age: it’s effectively the same image sensor Hasselblad has been using since at least 2018’s X1D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpFIqJ"&gt;The 907X with the 80mm f/1.9 lens produced the sharpest images at around f/5.6 to f/11, but the amount of depth you can isolate at f/1.9 is truly stunning. Although you can capture both Hasselblad 3FR RAW files and JPEGs, I like the colors from the JPEGs more than the flat profiles of the RAWs, even when I was editing them later on my computer. Hasselblad’s color science is truly remarkable. In particular, the red hues this camera captures are incredibly vibrant yet not over the top. I ended up seeking out red objects to take photos of, simply so that I could be amazed by how true to life the 907X could reproduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNz9p2"&gt;The 907X can shoot from ISO 100 to ISO 25,600. The image gets grainy once you cross ISO 6,400, but it’s a smooth grain that has a nice texture to it like film. I also took it out one night on a tripod and let that shutter sit open on still objects. The level of detail this sensor can capture never gets old, which led me to constantly zooming into the photos I had taken once I brought them over to my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MxUm9A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10382837"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3meRK"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unedited JPEGs from the Hasselblad 907X 50C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjzaVH"&gt;Video can only be captured in 2.7K, 29.97fps or Full HD, 29.97fps on the 907X. The camera also crops the image to 16:9. As a huge 4:3 ratio fan, this makes me very sad, especially considering how many pixels are not being used with the 16:9 crop. However, the video is crisp and holds on to that great color science. But for many reasons, this is not a video camera. It’s almost weird that Hasselblad even included the ability to shoot video at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK5JTk"&gt;First, there is absolutely no in-body stabilization, so when shooting handheld, you can see every shake, breath, and focus pull. Next, there is no continuous autofocus in video mode and certainly no face detection in either the photo or video modes. But more importantly, that lack of video frame rate and resolution options leads me to believe this camera’s video capabilities are for making GIFs or grabbing a quick video reference. Tune into our video review of the 907X for a sample video shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8Til8"&gt;I also don’t think the battery life could support consistent use of the 907X in video mode. While casually taking photos all day, I was only getting through about half a day of shooting before needing to swap in another battery. And while you can recharge the battery via the USB-C port on the camera, I can’t imagine owning this camera and not also owning at least two additional batteries, which cost $99 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LseadN9KFLA0ALH_xfpkmxYTyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355640/bfarsace_4464_20210303_0010_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A battery compartment houses the battery and two SD card slots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sixBjc"&gt;This premium sensor, sleek design, and brand name don’t come cheap: the Hasselblad 907X 50C starts at $6,400. For &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1436551-REG%2Ffujifilm_600020523_gfx_50r_medium_format.html&amp;amp;xcust=VergeHasselblad907X50CReview03092021"&gt;$3,000 less, the Fujifilm GFX 50R&lt;/a&gt; has effectively the same sensor in a more traditional-style mirrorless body. You really have to be in love with the Hasselblad brand or the desire to use this as a digital back for a Hasselblad V system camera in order to justify the 907X’s price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6SDsX"&gt;It’s that expensive price, the lack of any real handgrips, and the complete lack of weatherproofing that made me fear using this camera out in the world. I wholeheartedly believe it belongs in a studio that it will rarely leave, on product shoots where the goal is to make a viewer feel as though they can reach into the frame and grab an object, or in the hands of a much more cautious photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Hp43c7"&gt;The Hasselblad 907X 50C couldn’t be my daily driver, but it would be a sick camera to keep in the garage for those slower or gorgeous drives. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Photoshop now runs natively on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61R9_o5S0aK14s74-43CqxOixVg=/0x43:1200x843/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941300/959F9708_FDD3_4A17_ACD9_550FE130F90D.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vyAtcJ"&gt;Lightroom was the first Adobe creative app to make the leap to Apple Silicon, and now the much-anticipated release of Photoshop is here. According to the company, Photoshop for M1 Macs completes most tasks 1.5 times faster than when running on Intel. But the speed improvements extend beyond actual editing; Adobe says &lt;em&gt;a lot &lt;/em&gt;about Photoshop should now feel faster — including how quickly the app opens up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbp1T3"&gt;Photoshop for Apple Silicon was previously in beta, but now it’s being widely rolled out to Creative Cloud customers with an M1 Mac: those include the MacBook Air, entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini“These great performance improvements are just the beginning, and we will continue to work together with Apple to further optimize performance over time,” Adobe’s Pam Clark wrote &lt;a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/10/adobe-photoshop-ships-on-macs-with-apple-silicon-gains-speedier-selections-filters-and-performance-boosts.html#gs.v7det5"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSGCZD"&gt;In this case, “just the beginning” also means there are a small number of Photoshop features and tricks that haven’t yet made the move to the Apple Silicon version. According to Clark, these include recent additions like invite to edit cloud documents and preset syncing. “However, the performance gains across the rest of the application were so great we didn’t want to hold back the release for everyone while the team wraps up work on these last few features,” she added, noting that customers can always switch over to using the Intel build of Photoshop (with Rosetta 2) if they urgently need those features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozWLH8"&gt;Adobe is also bringing new features to Photoshop for iPad: cloud documents version history and the ability to work on cloud files while offline. Cloud documents version history lets you revert to an old version of a file dating back as far as 60 days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The plus-size knitters who are solving an inclusivity problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A graphic of white knitted sweaters on a blue yarn background, connected by threads." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U-YYcwwMxewUEQACWoKd9fx-5Rk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941018/VRG_ILLO_4422_DIY_KnittingCommunity.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7b6JDh"&gt;Fifteen years since first learning to knit, Petrina Hicks has only ever made sweaters for other people. There was one cardigan attempt back in 2015, but they had to make so many modifications that the end product was frumpy and ill-fitting. Hicks didn’t have the luxury to be picky: the cardigan was the only sweater pattern they could find above an XL or XXL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfCCaj"&gt;“I want to be a sweater maker,” Hicks said. “I couldn’t find things that were cute. I couldn’t find things that were in my style.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXtbHf"&gt;Hopeful crafters pick up knitting for a variety of reasons: to adopt a slow-fashion wardrobe, to keep &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-04-11/knitting-stress-relief-pandemic"&gt;stress at bay&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, or to make the clothes they wish existed, controlling the color and fit to their liking. Ravelry, the largest knitting and crochet site, lists over a million designs — there’s no shortage of patterns to pick from. Unless a knitter happens to be plus size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0X43r"&gt;People falling outside of straight sizing (generally between extra-small and large) say that even when they want to make their own clothing, their options are limited or they’re outright excluded. But in the last few years, advocacy from within the knitting community — mostly in digital spaces, like Instagram networks — have sparked discussion and action around how to make the craft more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVfrHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It took probably five minutes to map out the increases after I had my first set of numbers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4JUQG4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/gavriellamakes/"&gt;Gavriella Treminio&lt;/a&gt; is all about coziness. A knitter and designer based in Austin, Texas, Treminio favors simple, monochromatic knitwear, with &lt;a href="https://hellogavriella.myshopify.com/collections/knitting-patterns"&gt;interesting textures&lt;/a&gt; like eyelets and bobbles. Her most popular design, the Simone Pullover, goes up to a 5XL. A plus-size woman herself, Treminio says she wants everyone to feel included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loXQVB"&gt;Knitwear design is equal parts art and math. After creating a sample garment, knitters calculate how the number of stitches at each section of the pattern will change for smaller or bigger sizes. Though it takes a bit of extra work, grading knitwear is typically repeating the same set of calculations. For many plus-size knitters, the size range a designer offers is indicative of how much time they were willing to put in to make their work accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwk4CS"&gt;For Treminio, it’s barely an extra effort. “I just don’t understand why some people feel that it takes more work to include more sizes,” she said. “For my Simone, it took probably five minutes to map out the increases after I had my first set of numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk5SQD"&gt;Sarah Krentz, designer and owner of &lt;a href="https://www.swankyemuknits.com/"&gt;Swanky Emu Knits&lt;/a&gt;, produces patterns that forego the idea of sizes all together. Her spreadsheet sizing technique turns each pattern into an instant calculator for the customer. The interactive designs include a few blank spreadsheet cells, in which knitters fill in key measurements like bust, waist, and bicep circumference. The rest of the pattern — how many stitches to increase at the bodice, how many rows to knit before splitting the sleeves — updates automatically using pre-set formulas written by Krentz. No body is too small, too large, or too disproportionately shaped to fit the garments. Krentz also teaches classes for other designers who want to produce patterns using the same technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xB8jt"&gt;Krentz’s spreadsheet sizing doesn’t force knitters to explain why they deserve to wear her sweaters; a person’s measurements are just a set of numbers. In general, the decision to include larger sizes, she said, is seen as a charitable “extra” to throw in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2lKQQ"&gt;“That says something about the choice the designer made,” Krentz said. “Of not wanting someone like me, or not thinking someone like me should or will wear their garment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="N28e4C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People have their way of making you not feel welcome”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f0vk9l"&gt;For the past several years, that question of the imagined audience — of what a knitter is &lt;em&gt;supposed &lt;/em&gt;to look like — has swirled and at times exploded in the knitting community. Capping a sweater design at a 46-inch bust (an XL, according to Craft Yarn Council standards) sets a visible and quantitative limit to who can wear that pattern. But the industry has a way of asserting other assumptions around &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/25/18234950/knitting-racism-instagram-stories"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, gender, class, and more, issues that are perhaps imperceptible to those who have always felt welcomed in knitting spaces. Knitters say limited size offerings go hand in hand with issues plaguing the craft, often presented as a hobby for white women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH0YZg"&gt;“You definitely feel the -isms in the knitting community,” Hicks, who is Black, said. “People have their way of making you not feel welcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6hsaN"&gt;Narrow size offerings also leave money on the table. Despite the twee, old-timey image prevalent in the general public’s imagination, knitting can be an expensive hobby. A skein of yarn from a big box craft store might only cost $5, but hand-dyed and indie-produced fiber popular in the crafting community could run upward of $30 a skein. A knitter like Hicks who might need 10 to 15 skeins for a sweater is looking at a $300 investment, not including the time it takes to knit the garment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsQrcC"&gt;Excluding entire swaths of potential clientele based on size — not to mention people who might become discouraged from learning to knit — is bad for business. (This holds true in traditional retail, too; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/12/18222409/retailers-women-in-between-plus-straight-size"&gt;two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; of American women wear size 14 or above.) But experienced knitters say the failure to include a wide array of bodies in the development of designs also makes the final product’s quality suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYWpHf"&gt;Before patterns are published for sale, designers often have test knitting periods, where knitters are hired to essentially beta test the design. They’re asked to comment on the clarity of the written pattern as well as flag any fit issues, like a neck being too tight or forearms coming out baggy relative to the rest of the garment. Because all bodies are different, it helps designers to have an array of people giving feedback. In the past, when pressed to explain why patterns didn’t come in larger sizes, some designers have claimed they didn’t know a plus-size knitter to test knit their garment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q02fqQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m fat and I knit, and I’m telling you I want to give you money”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a7vkh9"&gt;It’s an excuse Mere Conatti had heard too many times. Conatti says she started the Instagram page &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/fattestknits/"&gt;Fat Test Knits&lt;/a&gt; out of spite, after two designers told her they hadn’t created their pattern in her size because they couldn’t find a suitable test knitter. They didn’t have any future plans to include Conatti’s size, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uuzgdr"&gt;“It made me really frustrated,” Conatti said. “I’m thinking, ‘I’m fat and I knit, and I’m telling you I want to give you money.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RuAf1"&gt;Fat Test Knits serves as a bulletin board that connects designers looking to offer a wider range of sizes with test knitters eager to help them. Conatti, along with another moderator, vets and shares designs that are in development, and followers then contact designers to be included in the testing group. Since 2019, the account has shared over 500 patterns: textured drawstring pants, crocheted bikinis, knit harnesses, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh5LFq"&gt;Though the shift is incremental, knitters say the industry is waking up. Some popular designers have updated old patterns to include extended sizes. Others have heeded calls from the public and committed to size-inclusive designs. Conatti says grassroots efforts and independent designers and publishers are largely to thank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMN8DO"&gt;Hicks has christened 2021 as the year they will make their first sweater for themselves, and now feels like there are options. But inclusive size ranges, diverse tester pools and other shifts in knitting are hard-fought wins. Plus-size people are still often forced to ask to be accommodated, rather than be welcomed from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xhQpVJ"&gt;“It’s just something I have to do if I want something,” Hicks said. “No one’s going to fight for me as hard as I would fight for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will warn users before posting ‘inappropriate or unkind’ comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VffmhCSUmonmsVSDIoyG0LD2OY8=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940761/image__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pop-up gives users the option of editing their comment, or posting it anyway.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TIkTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmfRGE"&gt;TikTok is rolling out a pop-up today that’s designed to warn users before they post a comment that might be “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-tools-to-promote-kindness"&gt;inappropriate or unkind.&lt;/a&gt;” The new feature is one of two being announced that are designed to “promote kindness” on the service. The other is Filter All Comments, so that they only appear once individually approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fucAHp"&gt;The new unkind warning appears if TikTok believes a comment might violate its community guidelines. “Would you like to reconsider posting this?” the pop-up box reads, before encouraging users to “Edit” it, or “Post anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxzNWP"&gt;Prompts like these have been explored by other social networks to cut down on bullying and harassment. Instagram rolled out similar prompts &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagrams-commitment-to-lead-fight-against-online-bullying"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;testing them last year&lt;/a&gt;, and they’ve also been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/k3bbfh/just_went_to_post_a_comment_on_facebook_this/"&gt;spotted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram later reported that results from introducing the prompt had been “&lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/our-progress-on-leading-the-fight-against-online-bullying"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt;” and that it found “these types of nudges can encourage people to reconsider their words when given a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emulZOG5UvwH3x4cNqacEOpIGgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358891/image__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The toggle is available in the Comments filters menu.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1GlLL1iwtJxKdeHTsTnUI_Jdufo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358892/image__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image; TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After enabling the feature, users must then manually approve comments on their videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yDpxR2"&gt;The new Filter All Comments feature can be enabled in the Comments filters menu, which already allows users to filter spam and offensive comments, or filter based on specific keywords. Once enabled, creators have to manually approve individual comments before they appear under their videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftcVNt"&gt;As part of today’s announcement, TikTok has also announced it’s partnering with the &lt;a href="https://cyberbullying.org/"&gt;Cyberbullying Research Center&lt;/a&gt; as it works on more anti-bullying initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU aims to double chip manufacturing amid growing fears about ‘digital sovereignty’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Semiconductor Production at Globalfoundries Europe Plant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbvKxvpYp7b5vj9mGUpQWfjKsZQ=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940681/1231203170.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Semiconductor production, as shown above in GlobalFoundries’ European factory, is an extremely capital-intensive business.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Box6j2"&gt;The European Union wants to double its chip manufacturing output to 20 percent of the global market by 2030. The goal is part of its new &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_983"&gt;Digital Compass plan&lt;/a&gt;, announced yesterday, which aims to boost “digital sovereignty” by funding various high-tech initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfGJv0"&gt;As well as doubling chip output, the EU also wants all households to have 5G access and gigabit internet connectivity by 2030; for “all key public services” to be available online in every member state; and for the bloc to have its first quantum computer. Funding for these and other projects will come from the EU’s €672.5 billion ($800 billion) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en"&gt;coronavirus response fund&lt;/a&gt;, with 20 percent of this money ($160 billion) earmarked for tech investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMCPs2"&gt;The EU’s ambition to produce more semiconductor chips is particularly notable. Maintaining a steady supply of these chips has become a pressing concern for nations around the world as supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the US-China trade war have affected global supplies. As with the flow of key resources like oil, access to cutting-edge chips is essential for many industries and products, from iPhones to cars. Currently, the bulk of production is concentrated in Asia, particularly in Taiwan and Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6r7FF"&gt;In February, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to investigate how the US can further support its own chip manufacturing industry. “This is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we face in this new era of pandemics, but also in defense cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more,” said Biden at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haYR4a0Ucpa2eb9Fki2NoqLES2M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358937/1231364830.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;US President Joe Biden pledged in February to secure the United States’ “critical” chip supply chains.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6hxqis"&gt;The EU’s worries mirror those of America’s. “We need to become less dependent on others when it comes to key technologies,” vice president of the European Commission, Margrethe Vestager, said at the launch of the Digital Compass plans, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-seeks-to-double-share-of-world-chip-market-by-2030-in-digital-sovereignty-drive-11615305395"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXgmt7"&gt;This dependency extends beyond chip supply, too. The last few years have seen the EU grapple with its relationship with Chinese tech giant Huawei, which supplies essential 5G components but has been hamstrung by US sanctions introduced over national security concerns. In related news, Apple announced this week that it will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-to-invest-over-1-billion-euros-in-germany-with-new-munich-campus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22322860%2Feu-semiconductor-chip-supply-double-output-2030-global-compass-investment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;invest more than €1 billion &lt;/a&gt; ($1.2 billion) in a silicon design center in Germany. Its employees will focus on “5G and future wireless technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eZkOS"&gt;Building up the EU’s chip production, though, will be a difficult task. Manufacturing semiconductors is an extremely expensive business, and the main success of European companies has been creating machinery used in this process rather than the chips themselves. Dutch firm ASML, for example, has a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly"&gt;majority market share&lt;/a&gt; in the production of equipment known as “photolithographic machines” that are essential for chipmaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPde6Z"&gt;“As China has shown, throwing money at chips does not guarantee success,” Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ. &lt;/em&gt;“For the last few decades, Europe has seen its number of semiconductor companies shrink, and it will require a mighty effort to wrest leadership from the US and Asia, which are also investing heavily.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overestimated iPhone 12 mini demand, by a lot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PX2wXenA5__HmquoXnkOMHZwero=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940493/vpavic_4279_20201107_0043.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GwFmuf"&gt;Apple is cutting production of the iPhone 12 mini in the first half of this year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-slashes-planned-iPhone-12-mini-production-for-1H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Planned production of the smallest iPhone 12 model has reportedly been reduced by 70 percent or more in the first half of this year, making up the majority of a 20 percent cut in total iPhone 12 production. Some suppliers have been asked to temporarily stop producing iPhone 12 mini-specific components, while other parts are being reallocated to the Pro and Pro Max, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCFt4B"&gt;Alongside the iPhone production news, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has pushed back production for two new Apple Silicon MacBooks. Originally due to enter mass production in May or June, the laptops will now be manufactured in the second half of the year. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t reveal which of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; these could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="93q6qX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iPhone production is still expected to be up overall compared to 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOTPMS"&gt;Despite the cuts, iPhone production is still scheduled to be up overall compared to 2020. Apple reportedly plans to produce 75 million handsets in the first half of the year, and 230 million phones over the course of 2021. Part of the reason is though to be because Apple was overly aggressive in booking up production capacity in the first place ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The shortage is now creating problems for companies both inside and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; of the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqyNCZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report is the latest indication that Apple’s miniature addition to its flagship smartphone lineup hasn’t lived up to expectations. Last month&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-iphone-12-mini-sales-slow-as-smaller-smartphones-lose-appeal-report-idUKKBN2A91N0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on analyst data which claimed sales of the 12 mini had made up just five percent of Apple’s smartphone sales in the first half of January. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that as of the end of last year, the mini made up 10 to 15 percent of Apple’s iPhone 12 series orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7HjEh"&gt;Although we liked the iPhone 12 mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;when we reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;, overall smartphone demand is trending towards phones with bigger screens. And while the 12 mini also benefits from being cheaper than the other handsets in the iPhone 12 lineup, customers have the option of &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-disappointed/#h-iphone-12-mini-sales:~:text=The%20CIRP%20report%20also%20touches%20on,be%20more%20enticing%20for%20certain%20buyers%3A"&gt;buying previous year’s models&lt;/a&gt; if they want to save money. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOuxWq"&gt;Sonos has partnered with Audi to equip the automaker’s Q4 E-Tron with sound, a first for the California-based audio company best known for home speakers. The news was confirmed Tuesday by Sonos CEO Patrick Spence after Audi published images of the Q4 E-Tron’s interior showing the Sonos logo. &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/sonos-audi-partnership"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt; the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYh0Qf"&gt;On Tuesday, Audi published a trove of shots showing off the interior of its next EV, the Q4 E-Tron. While the German carmaker emphasized its new augmented reality heads-up display, others took note of the Sonos logo, despite no mention of the collaboration in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7WIM8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10383842"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FgAIc"&gt;“We want to be in all the different categories of audio, and a big chunk of that is in auto,” said Spence during the Q&amp;amp;A of a &lt;a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2021/Sonos-Investor-Event/"&gt;scheduled investor event&lt;/a&gt;. “Our first partnership of bringing our sound experience to automobiles is with Audi.” The Sonos CEO and former RIM executive said that more details of the Audi partnership will be shared “shortly,” presumably at the Q4 E-Tron launch event in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK99w4"&gt;With the announcement, Sonos joins a long list of audio companies that have made the jump to autos, including Bose, Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins, and Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen. The partnerships are seen as a way for home audio companies to diversify revenue sources, and for automakers to use brands known for premium audio to sway your buying decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKrUey"&gt;The news follows the Tuesday launch of Sonos’ most portable speaker to date, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319251/sonos-roam-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;$169 Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;. Sonos is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office"&gt;rumored to be working on headphones&lt;/a&gt; as the company broadens its focus from whole-home audio to providing sound anywhere you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has 18GB of RAM and a rear-facing OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xU7BKq-g8xVhFCvkMdSg7K2Fa6Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940445/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7O1TxR"&gt;Asus is going big with its latest gaming phones. The ROG Phone 5 lineup will start shipping this month across the globe, costing 799 euros (around $950) for the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage. Every configuration has a 6.78-inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 300Hz touch sampling rate. Also, the headphone jack has made a comeback after being absent from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a quad DAC in tow for hi-res audio. (In case you’re wondering where the ROG Phone 4 went, Asus skipped over the number four, like OnePlus did, due to its similarities with the word “death” in some Asian languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hemsoR"&gt;The most notable changes from the last generation are exclusive to some even more expensive configurations, the ROG Phone 5 Pro and Ultimate (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;which I published a review of&lt;/a&gt;) that release in April for 1,199 euros (approximately $1,420) and in May for 1,299 euros (about $1,583), respectively. Both of these models have double the storage and more RAM (starting at 16GB in the Pro and going all the way up to 18GB in the Ultimate); come in limited edition colors; and have two additional ultrasonic touch sensors than the standard model, located near where your ring fingers might rest while holding the phone in landscape mode. You’ll also get a case and a clip-on AeroActive Cooler 5 fan attachment with purchase with either the Pro or Ultimate phone (which adds two more buttons attached to the fan.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IG0kJe"&gt;The new Asus gaming phones aren’t huge departures from their predecessors, though the hardware and software are more refined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;I reviewed the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, and while it delivers on its promises to be a spec and feature juggernaut in some clever ways, paying $1,580 for it seems steep. Even the $950 base configuration isn’t what I’d consider affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMz3EQ"&gt;The Ultimate and Pro include “ROG Vision,” a feature that pushes premade or custom text or graphics to its rear-facing OLED screen. It’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, allowing you to personalize your phone if you want. The standard ROG Phone 5 simply has a backlit ROG logo, which some might find to be just enough pizazz.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pIhpxO"&gt;I go into all of the features in the review. But if you’re just passing by and want to know all about the specs, I’ve attached a handy table just for you.&lt;/p&gt;
