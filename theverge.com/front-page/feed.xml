    <title>‘Rife with sexism’: employees of Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin describe ‘toxic’ workplace culture </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AWARD-BEZOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnpvlAXo9ZWK3Z-61EIcL26mOqA=/0x0:4497x2998/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932028/1177532676.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M5cUa"&gt;21 current and former employees of Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin published &lt;a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past"&gt;a damning essay&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday saying the company “turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8xjI5"&gt;Co-authored by Blue Origin’s former head of employee communications Alexandra Abrams, the essay describes multiple accounts of sexist and dismissive behavior from some of the company’s “one-hundred percent” male senior technical and program leaders and says “professional dissent at Blue Origin is actively stifled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Y01m"&gt;The employees accuse the company’s CEO Bob Smith of brushing off dissent by discouraging staff from raising questions during internal town halls, asking a colleague to track “troublemakers or agitators,” and forcing out employees for speaking out about safety issues related to Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourism rocket. “Smith’s inner circle of loyalists makes unilateral decisions, often without the buy-in of engineers, other experts, or senior leaders across various departments,” the employees say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEZSqI"&gt;In an interview with CBS this morning, Abrams, speaking out for the first time, said she was fired by Blue Origin in 2019, with her manager saying “Bob and I can’t trust you anymore,” referring to the CEO. “You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time,” Abrams said in the interview. “I’ve gotten far enough away from it that I’m not afraid enough to let them silence me anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BX5hY7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alexandra Abrams, a former head of employee communications for Blue Origin, is speaking out against the company to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LaurieSegall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LaurieSegall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time. They are incompatible.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/JHuFY3cjcs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JHuFY3cjcs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1443553601851322372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIuM1Y"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Blue Origin spokesperson said “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps3fKG"&gt;The spokesperson also said Abrams was fired “after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations,” a claim Abrams denied to CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuERH4"&gt;The essay, published on Lioness, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537102/tech-workers-harassment-hotline-vault-lioness-strategies"&gt;platform for whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt;, indicated Blue Origin sometimes overlooked safety issues to favor speed, amid heated competition with other billionaire-backed companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX or Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. “Competing with other billionaires—and ‘making progress for Jeff’—seemed to take precedence over safety concerns that would have slowed down the schedule,” the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92maFt"&gt;Blue Origin has struggled with internal strife in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZeZf7"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21198272/blue-origin-coronavirus-leaked-audio-test-launch-workers-jeff-bezos"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported that Blue Origin employees were outraged by the pressure they faced from senior leadership&lt;/a&gt; to continue in-person work and travel for a New Shepard test launch during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when much of the country was locking down to curb the virus’ spread. Responding to employee concerns in one meeting, Jeff Ashby, the company’s senior mission assurance director and a former NASA astronaut, said: “I would say that you should ask yourself, as an individual, are you acting as a toxin in the organization, fanning discontent, or are you really trying to help our senior leaders make better decisions?” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s new $15 smart scale has a mode for luggage, pets, and babies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_hyn0twk_5o5t0b16-Dl6U-kgyo=/0x2:7952x5303/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931929/10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STYoUm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDNbK0"&gt;Wyze, the budget-focused tech company that now sells everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686582/new-wyze-pan-cam-v2-specs-release-date-price-shipping"&gt;security cameras&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450637/wyze-headphones-video-doorbell-c-pricing-release-date"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;, has launched a new smart scale with four built-in electrodes capable of measuring everything from body fat percentage to body water percentage. In addition to weighing humans, there is also a dedicated mode to let you weigh your “baby, pet, luggage, or your kid’s absurdly heavy backpack,” Wyze says. The Scale S follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190980/wyze-band-wearable-fitness-tracker-alexa-scale-connected-price"&gt;original Wyze Scale released last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s $5 cheaper with a price of just $15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gf3RIU"&gt;Weight is displayed on the built-in 3.5-inch LED display, while a companion app (of course) allows you to set goals and track progress over time. It can sync data with Fitbit, Google Fit, and Apple Health and track data for up to eight different users. Battery life is rated at 18 months from the included trio of AAA batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfOyMUhcJrxogZTBc9OJ3hiRLyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889709/6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a dedicated mode for weighing a dog (center) or child (bottom right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFUGMG"&gt;In total, Wyze says the Scale S is capable of measuring 11 body composition metrics, which is broadly in line with its original scale. These include: weight, body fat percentage, lean body mass, BMI, muscle weight, visceral fat, basal metabolic rate, bone mass, metabolic age, protein, and body water percentage. The Scale S will also eventually be able to track heart rate, Wyze says, although this functionality is launching later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLCskC"&gt;Alongside its scales, Wyze is also announcing a version of its &lt;a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/dd1a477bcf547777c281116073fca81b2cef2163?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwyze.com%2Fwyze-cam-outdoor.html&amp;amp;userId=7067207&amp;amp;signature=aae0f1cd79790f85"&gt;Wyze Cam Outdoor&lt;/a&gt; with a Forest Camo skin made in collaboration with Dbrand. The camera is shipping now for $59.99, which translates to a $10 premium over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21298757/wyze-cam-outdoor-release-date-news-features-battery-life-cloud-subscription"&gt;standard outdoor security camera&lt;/a&gt;. The Wyze Scale S, meanwhile, is available to preorder starting today and will ship in November. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will now let you make group chats across Instagram and Messenger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7oyVvpTbJ187il6EIhZiQX6-wdE=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931916/2._GXAC_Polls_in_IG_MSGR_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross-app group chats between Instagram and Messenger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SqrB95"&gt;Facebook will now let you start cross-app group chats between Messenger and Instagram, the &lt;a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/09/30/new-group-chat-experiences-cross-app-chats-chat-themes-polls-and-watch-together/"&gt;company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The update is a big step forward in Facebook’s ambitions to make its apps work better with each other. To be able to use the cross-app communications, you’ll have to opt in, and Facebook says that “over 70% of eligible people on Instagram have updated to the new Messenger experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcn6HF"&gt;The company is bringing other new features to the messaging apps in addition to cross-app group messaging. Polls will be available in group DMs on Instagram and in cross-app chats so you can, for example, vote on where to grab lunch. Facebook has added group typing indicators to Messenger, so you can see when multiple people are drafting a message. (It’s unclear from Facebook’s blog post if group typing indicators are coming to Instagram as well, but I’ve asked the company to clarify that.) And you can now use Facebook’s Watch Together feature to watch videos from your Instagram feed with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hF2dHh9t13opqQThCzLIF338G0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890486/Group_Typing_Indicator_iOS_1.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image on the right shows group typing indicators in Messenger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qH5Tag"&gt;Facebook is also adding new chat themes to Messenger, including a “cottagecore” theme, one inspired by J Balvin’s latest album, and an astrology theme.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Microsoft’s Surface Duo 2 compares with Samsung’s flagship foldable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHCahZ1ArfRO8wI2MKOd-lbZK5o=/0x0:1361x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931863/Microsoft_Surface_Duo_2_Lifestyle_Press_Image_White_Colorway.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 works with Microsoft’s lineup of Surface Pens, including the Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/em&gt;. | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uvp11o"&gt;It’s official: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;troubled Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; is now last-gen. Microsoft announced its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686707/microsoft-surface-duo-2-phone-design-specs-features-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, during its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;fall Surface event&lt;/a&gt;, capping off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;months of rumors&lt;/a&gt; and introducing the device alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, and a bevy of new devices designed to take advantage of &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84OsSx"&gt;The new Android-based smartphone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;starts at $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt; — $100 less than the original — and launches on October 20th in multiple configurations. It retains the hinged design of its predecessor — only this time, it comes equipped with a more thought-out camera system, 5G support, and a modern processor that brings it more in line with flagships from Samsung, Xiaomi, and OnePlus. And while it’s not a foldable in the traditional sense — it’s outfitted with two screens, not one — it’s not in a class of its own, either. Blame the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2upDAP"&gt;The Fold 3 recently set the bar for what foldable phones could achieve, bringing with it better multitasking, a water-resistant build, and a refined display that’s a notable step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;original model&lt;/a&gt; released in 2019. But is Samsung’s premium foldable a match for the forthcoming Duo 2? After all, Samsung’s foldable is markedly different from Microsoft’s when it comes to design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nFo0sv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best phone to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"},{"title":"The best smartphone you can buy under $500","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9wv8PG"&gt;The Fold 3 features a smaller, 6.2-inch display that covers the entire front of the device. It also contains a flexible, 7.6-inch OLED on the inside, which unfurls as you open the phone with the aid of an aluminum hinge. There’s still a small gap between the two sides when closed, however, which is visible on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; as well. The latter phone — an entirely different device from the Fold 3 we’re comparing here — also features a foldable display, only the device is smaller, folds vertically, and retails for $700 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGVNFp"&gt;The Duo 2 doesn’t rely on a flexible display. Like its predecessor, it uses two separate, 5.8-inch OLED panels that amount to 8.3 inches when viewed together, with a large bezel running between them. The hinge connecting the two displays allows you to fold the phone in half with the displays on the outside so you can use the device one-handed, though the phone’s large camera bump means they’ll never close completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dktYqz"&gt;The screens — while the selling point — aren’t everything, however. Below, we’ve compared the Fold 3 and Duo 2 in more detail ahead of our full Duo 2 review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f3yzsB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10768369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tqSzKP"&gt;Spec-for-spec, in some ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="leOvHG"&gt;To put it mildly: the original Surface 2 had its shortcomings. The camera was atrocious, the software buggy, and Microsoft was still charging a starting price of $1,399 for just the device, a staggering number when you consider the faults. And while it was seemingly released premature, it was innovative, so much so &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn hoped — like me — that we’d see a second iteration of the smartphone down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJoj2U"&gt;Well, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nmPdR4lB6wNvS4fhfJT8IIlQ7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868426/bfarsace_210921_4770_0049.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 features thinner bezels and the same processor found as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xYD311"&gt;On paper, the Surface Duo 2 looks to address many of the aforementioned problems. It’s equipped with the same high-end Snapdragon 888 processor found in the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which is Qualcomm’s latest chipset and the brains behind almost every Android flagship released this year, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Z Fold 3, the second-gen Duo will be available in both 128GB and 512GB storage configurations when it launches next month, as well as an additional 128GB variant. The Duo 2 only features 8GB of RAM, however, compared to the Fold 3’s 12GB. Software optimization will certainly play a role in how efficient the phone is at multitasking, but the Fold 3 has the upper hand spec-wise. Both phones also support 5G connectivity, Wi-Fi 6, and NFC for contactless payments — something the original Duo did not offer — along with either Bluetooth 5.0 or 5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yrhOLY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697006"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0VneZ"&gt;Battery capacity tells a similar story. The Fold 3 packs in a 4,400mAh battery, which, in our testing, lasted a full day with roughly four hours of screen time. The Duo 2 features dual batteries that add up to a capacity of 4,449mAh, and Samsung claims they should provide 15.5 hours of local video playback and 28 hours of talk time. Both models also support fast charging and USB-C; however, the Fold 3 additionally supports wireless charging, whereas the Duo 2 does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgjzwo"&gt;We’ll have a better sense of how far that battery capacity will get you once we’ve tested the device, but the increased capacity on this year’s Duo should help it compensate for the 90Hz display and added 5G support. The two batteries inside the original Duo only added up to a mere 3,577mAh, yet we routinely made it through a full day on a single charge. We’re hoping the same can be said of the Duo 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lzokQU"&gt;Displays on display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 houses a vibrant, 7.6-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtppzUsJYDXp1-B7atPOX1httEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869992/Surface_Duo_2_with_Pen_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slight curviture of the Duo 2’s displays allows them to act as a notification panel when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUe60X"&gt;Like all foldables, the defining characteristic of the Duo 2 and Fold 3 are the displays, which afford each smartphone more screen real estate and allow them to function a bit more akin to a tablet when opened. On the inside, the Fold 3 features a bright, 7.6-inch OLED screen with 2208 x 1768 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. It also sports a 6.2-inch display on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution and, again, a 120Hz refresh rate. In our testing, we found both displays to be a vast improvement over earlier iterations, with the inner display showcasing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;added level of durability&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Samsung’s custom aluminum alloy. The exterior display on the Fold 3 also means you don’t need to open the device in order to use it, which renders it a little closer to a traditional phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpyKGf"&gt;The Duo 2, however, takes a different approach. Inside, you’ll find two 5.8-inch OLED panels, each with 1344 x 1892 resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. When opened, the dual panels create an 8.3-inch display with 2688 x 1892 resolution, with a bezel running between the two. The Duo 2 doesn’t offer an exterior cover like the Fold 3; however, the curved glass on the edges of the display does showcase the time and some notifications when the phone is closed, giving you some basic info at a glance. The 360-degree hinge also allows you to open the Duo 2 like a book or prop it up like a tent, providing an added level of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7An523"&gt;The outward design of both models is as varied as their approach to the display. The Fold 3 is relatively tall and narrow when closed, weighing in at 271 grams. The hinge-reliant Duo 2 is slightly shorter and heavier at 284 grams, though; it’s also thinner — so thin, in fact, that Microsoft claims the Duo 2 is the thinnest 5G device on the market (it’s only 11 millimeters thick when closed). It’s not as thin as the original Duo, which measures 9.9 millimeters at the hinge, but it’s close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQhJ4k"&gt;Additionally, both smartphones use Gorilla Glass Victus, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Corning claims can resist&lt;/a&gt; a six-foot drop while continuing to ward off scratches. The Fold 3, however, takes things further with IPX8 water resistance, meaning it can be fully submerged in up to half a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. We don’t anticipate most people will rush out to dunk their phones, but it’s nice to know it can handle an unforeseen spill or a little rain. The Duo 2 only offers an IPX1 rating, which, honestly, is effectively nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3WpTd"&gt;Android 11 all around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SXHsG4"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Duo 2 and Z Fold 3 are also similar on the software front. Whereas the first-gen Duo launched with Android 10 has yet to receive Android 11 — Microsoft says it will arrive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;before the end of the year&lt;/a&gt; — the Duo 2 ships with a customized version of the latter designed for better multitasking. The Fold 3 also runs on Android 11, albeit with some small visual and interface tweaks courtesy of Samsung’s custom One UI 3 skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S79WEKoUZ0TCUgJpSBFyqUC_56g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801132/Screenshot_20210823_123216_Twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Samsung’s One UI 3, multitasking on the Z Fold 3 is actually an enjoyable experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o8ot3Q"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;Samsung said&lt;/a&gt; recent Galaxy devices will receive support for three generations of Android updates, and as such, the Fold 3 is set to receive routine Android OS updates alongside monthly security patches for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;next four years&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has promised timely updates for the Duo 2, but it’s still unclear as to what that looks like. A year after its debut, the original Duo remains buggy, despite Microsoft having shipped a number of updates to address multitasking and gesture issues. Samsung has a better track record when it comes to issuing software updates in a timely manner, a likely boon for the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc7Wyb"&gt;Both smartphones are designed for multitasking and productivity, however, and their software reflects that. The Duo 2 can run two apps side by side or one app that can expand across both displays. The Duo 2 also boasts compatibility with Microsoft’s lineup of Surface Pens, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt;, which can magnetically dock and charge wirelessly when paired with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690565/surface-duo-2-pen-cover-price-release-date-slim-pen"&gt;optional Surface Duo 2 Pen Cover&lt;/a&gt; ($65). The Fold 3 offers a similar set of functionality thanks to features like Flex mode and App Pair, as well as the Fold-specific S Pen, which is sold separately and also requires a special case for storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHi0cu"&gt;Camera components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s1cDvT"&gt;Camera-wise, neither model is aimed at photography enthusiasts. Microsoft’s next foldable may be a massive step up from its first-gen counterpart and, on paper, a slight cut above the Fold 3, but it’s still more midrange than flagship. That said, both the Duo 2 and the Fold 3 feature a three-camera array on the rear, with 12-megapixel sensors for wide and telephoto. The Duo 2, however, also includes a higher-resolution ultrawide camera (16MP compared to the Fold 3’s 12MP sensor), as well as optical image stabilization on the wide and ultrawide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGlDO6"&gt;Aperature, on the other hand, is nearly the same across both devices, with the wide-angle on the Duo 2 being slightly faster at f/1.7. We’ll have to wait until we can put the Duo 2 through its paces before we make a final judgment call, but if its three-camera array performs anything like that on the Fold 3, it’s still not going to compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdTA_zVVycc6UWK44TP4PXTJjG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880543/Surface_Duo_2_Photography_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The three-camera array on the Duo 2 looks to be a significant step up from the 11MP sensor on the original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="77SP3x"&gt;On the front, the Duo 2 sports a 12MP shooter with an f/2.0 aperture. The Fold 3 sports a 10MP selfie camera with an f/2.2 on the cover, along with a 4MP under-display camera on the interior, which is equal parts terrible and distracting given the distinct moire effect the experimental feature creates at certain viewing angles. Both devices can also capture 1080p and 4K video footage at 30 and 60fps, as well as slow-motion video at up to 240fps. The Fold 3 goes a bit further with support for 720p, slow-motion video at 960fps, and 4K hyperlapse videos at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0aFvlU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l8SCbz"&gt;Sky-high pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="di4uXg"&gt;Let’s face it: neither foldable is cheap — far from it. The 128GB base configuration of the Surface Duo 2 will &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeSurfaceDuo2092221&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-duo-2%2F9408kgxp4xjl%3Frtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;run you $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt;, with the 256GB and 512GB models retailing for $1,599.99 and $1,799.99, respectively. Like the original model, Microsoft’s latest foldable will be available in glacier white, in addition to a new obsidian black colorway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684018/microsoft-surface-duo-2-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;Preorders are already underway&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments expected to go out before the phone’s launch on October 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWLNiX"&gt;The Galaxy Fold 3 is even more expensive. The 256GB base model &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGyXdxDbnR#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retails for $1,799.99&lt;/a&gt; and is currently available in one of three colors: phantom green, phantom black, and phantom silver. The 512GB configuration runs $1,899.99; however, the larger model is only available in phantom black. Like the Duo 2, there are carrier deals, trade-in discounts, and payment plans available for the Fold 3; however, most kickbacks come in the form of credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCNlhE"&gt;While not the focal point of this comparison, there’s also the Galaxy Flip 3 to consider. The device’s internal display might be smaller, but the phone still features a Snapdragon 888 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a water-resistant build. It also &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGy2XM0TC2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starts at $1,000&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it retails for around the same price as many high-end, non-folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZgrDZ5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how much that free iPhone really costs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="uxDVDs"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGDDHc"&gt;On paper, Microsoft’s Surface Duo 2 shows a lot of promise, particularly when compared to its predecessor. It has a modern, high-end processor and upgraded camera system, along with a bigger battery, larger displays, and 5G support. These are welcome upgrades, but we won’t have a concrete idea as to how well they perform until we can do an in-depth review. There’s also the question of longevity and support — will Microsoft truly update the Duo 2 in a timely fashion, or will it go the way of the Duo and only receive the occasional software patch and security update? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhyK87"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3, meanwhile, is the best foldable you can buy right now. The base configuration of the Fold 3 is $300 more than the starting price of the Duo 2, but it comes equipped with similar specs, along with a 120Hz display, wireless charging, and a waterproof, IPX8-rated design. The latter two features are now more of the norm than the exception, and it’s a shame Microsoft didn’t incorporate either with the Duo 2. Still, if you see no need for a display with a higher refresh rate or any of the aforementioned perks that come with the Fold 3, Microsoft’s second-gen foldable might be worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDMXQJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors reportedly selling former GM factory to Foxconn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfWt7XNqGKBkt7qkW6nzTYD6sRk=/4x0:3996x2661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931850/1232963349.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tzFs8g"&gt;Struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors is nearing a sale of its Ohio factory to Taiwanese iPhone assembler Foxconn, which has its own electric vehicle ambitions, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-30/lordstown-nears-deal-to-sell-ohio-car-plant-to-taiwan-s-foxconn?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The deal could be announced as soon as Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozNjEu"&gt;Lordstown Motors bought the 6.2 million square foot facility from General Motors in 2019 shortly after the Detroit automaker closed it down — a decision that drew the ire of then-president Trump. The startup previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt; that it was planning to rent out space at the factory in an effort to make money amid a serious cash crunch. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./business/autos-transportation/lordstown-motors-talks-sell-ohio-plant-foxconn-bloomberg-2021-09-30/"&gt;also reporting that a sale is on the verge of happening&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M05uqb"&gt;Since buying it, Lordstown Motors has put about $240 million worth of work into getting the factory ready to build its electric pickup truck, the Endurance. A spokesperson for Lordstown Motors declined to comment. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tys6q"&gt;When GM sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, Trump praised the deal as “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” But the startup — which was founded by the former CEO of Workhorse, another struggling EV startup — has run into an incredible amount of trouble ever since, despite going public and raising hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020. Lordstown Motors’ CEO was forced out earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;after he was caught lying about the veracity of the preorders for its truck&lt;/a&gt;. The startup has lowered its initial production goals for that truck, too. Both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;launched probes into Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has said it only has enough money to survive through mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tSzMQv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"},{"title":"Foxconn is dangling a shiny new EV plant in front of Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569992/foxconn-fisker-wisconsin-electric-vehicle-factory-talks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wBAayZ"&gt;Foxconn has spent much of the last year talking about expanding into electric vehicles as a way to diversify away from consumer electronics. It has struck deals with the likes of Geely, which is China’s largest private automaker, as well as Fisker Inc., a California EV startup that has yet to make an electric vehicle. Foxconn has also developed its own electric vehicle platform that it intends to sell to other automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU7S1x"&gt;In March, Foxconn said it would reveal where it wants to build EVs with Fisker Inc. by July, but that self-imposed deadline came and went. The company had considered using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;mostly empty complex it built in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; — another project that the Trump administration touted highly — but Fisker founder Henrik Fisker said he didn’t want to build his cars in a state that &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/08/09/fisker-ev-plans-for-underused-foxconn-site-hit-snag-on-wisconsin-auto-sales-rules/?sh=2f5f19ea79de"&gt;wouldn’t allow him to sell directly to consumers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kratos’ voice actor says God of War: Ragnarok delayed ‘because of me’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYCgzUp_lbn7SsR85InmUHWVHIM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931806/E_3vU3YXMAEXoy2.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony Santa Monica&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D9xDhc"&gt;Kratos’ voice actor, Christopher Judge, says he’s the reason why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665085/sony-god-of-war-ragnarok-playstation-ps5-showcase"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was delayed. In a tweet, Judge writes that he needed multiple surgeries in 2019 and that &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; developer Sony Santa Monica studios delayed the game so he could recover and continue voicing video games’ favorite problematic dad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YwJ7Yz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  in my feels right now. I need to be forthcoming. This has been approved by no one. To the beloved fandom, Ragnarok was delayed because of me. August 2019, I couldn’t walk. Had to have back surgery, both hips replaced, and, knee surgery. They waited for me too rehab… &lt;br&gt;Cont…&lt;/p&gt;— Christopher Judge (@iamchrisjudge) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1443434928385843209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pYJirE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;No threats, no ,” who do you think you are?” Nothing but love and support. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SonySantaMonica&lt;/a&gt; has never said a word about the delay, and what caused it. Studios are assholes, but this company from top to bottom, should give us hope. What they did for the crew is way more…&lt;/p&gt;— Christopher Judge (@iamchrisjudge) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1443436861867708419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3nxFW"&gt;Judge goes on to praise Sony Santa Monica for its dedication and compassion, saying, “Everyone involved in the &lt;em&gt;GofW&lt;/em&gt; franchise puts their hearts and souls in every frame you see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU2JGe"&gt;2018’s &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; was a continuation of the seminal PlayStation hack ‘n slash franchise but a stark departure from the previous games’ rage-filled hyper-violence. In it, Kratos is older, wiser, but not necessarily kinder, as he navigates being a father to his young son Atreus. Christopher Judge won recognition for his role as Kratos, with his constant growling of the word “Boy,” now synonymous with the character and a popular meme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T50r13"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440393/sony-god-of-war-ragnarok-sequel-ps5-playstation-5-2021-teaser"&gt;Sony teased &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the follow-up to &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;, last year with a 2021 release date. However, in June of this year, Sony Santa Monica announced it had decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465232/god-of-war-ragnorok-ps5-ps4-delay-2022"&gt;to delay the game into 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The delay wasn’t particularly shocking since the COVID-19 pandemic caused several games slated for a 2021 release to be postponed. But according to Judge, it seems the pandemic might not have been the reason for &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;’s new release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VFbko"&gt;“Sony Santa Monica has never said a word about the delay, and what caused it,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1443436861867708419?s=20"&gt;Judge writes&lt;/a&gt;. “Studios are assholes, but this company, from top to bottom, should give us hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmmt0A"&gt;Judge began his Twitter thread after &lt;em&gt;God Of War&lt;/em&gt; won IGN’s &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-best-video-game-of-all-time-bracket-vote-finale-results-winners"&gt;“Best Video Game of All Time”&lt;/a&gt; competition, beating out &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; for the honor. The competition itself was noteworthy if only for its ability to upset nearly every member of the video gaming public with highly questionable matchup outcomes. I don’t know how the nigh-undisputed masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt; lost to *checks notes* &lt;em&gt;Burnout 3: Takedown&lt;/em&gt;, but it did, and we, as a species, are worse for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XUYYs"&gt;Judge closed his thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1443446113571274757?s=20"&gt;with an anecdote&lt;/a&gt; about how he almost quit &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; entirely when he learned long-time &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; director Cory Balrog would not be directing &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;. When Balrog asked him to trust him and &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;’s new director Eric Williams, Judge agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQxBky"&gt;“Update, Eric Williams is a motherfuckin’ beast!!!” Judge writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRGVig"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7g14B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corsair’s first gaming monitor is the pricey, 32-inch Xeneon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Corsair Xeneon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sabAkVu3fu11KzrTbBSFTQIY4w=/0x0:1989x1326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931682/xeneonhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Corsair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oJwLu"&gt;When it comes to PC components and accessories, there isn’t much that Corsair itself doesn’t make. The company’s adding gaming monitors to its list of offerings with today’s announcement of a 32-inch model called Xeneon. It uses a 1440p quantum dot IPS 16:9 aspect ratio panel that has a 165Hz refresh rate to display fast-paced content. Other standout specs include AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility for adaptive sync to eliminate screen tearing when the frame rate fluctuates. It also has 100 percent coverage of the SRGB color gamut, and on its back, there are plenty of ports, which I’ll expand upon later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jw9GYb"&gt;Corsair is utilizing its well-known presence in the market to go up against not just other monitor manufacturers, like LG, Samsung, BenQ and Acer, but other big names in PC gaming as a whole — specifically, Razer, which released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22524309/razer-raptor-27-gaming-monitor-vesa-freesync-features-2021-price-ports"&gt;revised 27-inch Raptor monitor earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Corsair’s Xeneon leans on its iCue ecosystem, so you can change your monitor settings in the same app that can tweak the settings and lighting for your Corsair-branded mouse and keyboard. Perhaps the even bigger humble brag is that the Xeneon’s stand is compatible with rigging systems, &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/multi-mount-system"&gt;like Flex Arms released by the Corsair-owned Elgato&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an Elgato Stream Deck, you’ll be able to switch numerous display settings on the fly with one, including color temperature, response time, and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Xeneon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qxmp0FAr2vUuy-SxSOlci6QwrQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888459/XENEON_32QHD165_Gaming_Monitor_20.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Corsair&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contrary to what this image indicates, you can use accessories from non-Corsair brands with the Xeneon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DWIB3T"&gt;Even if you aren’t planning on using all of that integration, the Xeneon has plenty of other noteworthy features. It supports Vesa DisplayHDR400, topping out at 440 nits of brightness for HDR content. And speaking of Vesa, it has a standard Vesa mount, so you can stick it onto a monitor arm of your choosing if you’d like. The Xeneon supports a range of motion, including tilt, swivel and height adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0IzR2"&gt;In terms of video inputs, it has two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DisplayPort, and one USB-C port (this port also supports 15W PD charging). The HDMI 2.0 ports support QHD resolution at up to 144Hz, while the DisplayPort input and USB-C support up to 165Hz refresh rate at QHD, according to Corsair’s documentation. If you want to connect devices to the Xeneon to transfer data through the aforementioned USB-C video input, as well as through two USB-A ports, you’ll need to plug its dedicated upstream USB-C port into your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Xeneon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zxtRABgJlgakTyYteTia2NZBwKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888474/xeneon.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rear view of the Xeneon’s die-cast aluminum stand and cable management system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TTS5Zu"&gt;The nice thing about most things that Corsair makes is that there is usually a wide range of options at several price points. With the Xeneon, its first and currently only gaming monitor comes in at a rather high $799.99. I haven’t tried this model, so I can’t be the judge of whether it’s worth it. But of note, this cost has a pretty good warranty baked in — both a three-year hardware warranty and a “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fxeneon-quickstart&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22700882%2Fcorsair-gaming-monitor-32-inch-xeneon-price-features-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;zero dead pixel&lt;/a&gt;” warranty, which will let you swap it out if your Xeneon has one or more bright pixel or six or more dark subpixels. Both of those are more than zero, but to my knowledge, most monitor manufacturers require more than one dead pixel to warrant giving you a new panel at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCx6YS"&gt;As good as that warranty seems, $800 is far more than I would spend for a QHD gaming monitor or even two combined (my Acer XV272U was a cool $300), though, for people who already have a lot of Corsair and Elgato gear, this might be the monitor you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Game Awards will take place in December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZG-owJccg44_WXjotenXcDbUiY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931684/TGA2021_Statue_Exploration_4k_0001_OverTheTop_000338_38_0038.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJycmq"&gt;The 2021 edition of The Game Awards, the annual Oscars-like award show for video games, will take place on December 9th. The show will take place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, and unlike last year, there will be an in-person audience — though it will be an invite-only event. Details about specific health and safety protocols for the in-person event will be shared “in the coming weeks,” according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmeNiy"&gt;The awards, which will be hosted by creator and executive producer Geoff Keighley, will also be livestreamed on more than 40 different platforms, so you’ll be able to watch from home if you want. The show organizers are also promising that there will be “free playable game content” available as part of an “immersive digital experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3CFNt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There could be some surprising reveals in store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qWuOXv"&gt;Like previous years, The Game Awards will also feature “first-look world premieres and new game announcements.” There was some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166109/the-game-awards-2020-announcements-trailers-fortnite-smash-bros-among-us-mass-effect"&gt;big news in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, including the announcements of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt;Sephiroth in &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft brought a huge surprise to the 2019 show: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console"&gt;the reveal of the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. There aren’t any details about what announcements to expect this year, but if past years are any indication, there could be some fun surprises in store.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy is restocking Nvidia RTX 30-series cards in stores on Friday morning </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jAdQx1H-SNR7Y41qDQMFPJZ1IPo=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931646/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8fCgOv"&gt;If you’re an avid PC builder, you know that getting your hands on any of Nvidia’s 30-series GPUs has been next to impossible since they debuted. But Best Buy is hosting an event in select stores starting Friday, October 1st to give you the opportunity. If you haven't been outside in a while, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGVRfNviLw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can use this page to find the store closest to you&lt;/a&gt; that will have these GPUs in stock, sold at their retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVneEe"&gt;Unfortunately, you can't just head down there cash in hand and hope to snatch one up. Best Buy has stated that you’ll need to line up at one of the designated stores before 7:30AM local time. This is when employees will begin handing out a limited amount of tickets (one per customer) that will allow you to purchase a single GPU. Of course, this is not a guarantee that everyone in line will get a ticket, or that everyone will get their graphics card of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8vle2"&gt;A spokesperson from Best Buy has shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the following models will be available at all participating stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1Cqm9z"&gt;So grab your favorite space blanket and your comfiest lawn chair; if you line up early, there's a fair chance you could take home one of these GPUs. But don’t sweat it if you can’t make it to this one. Best Buy hosts these restock events just about every month. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nx10mw"&gt;The Apple MagSafe Battery pack recently launched in July, and we are now finally seeing the first significant discount on the magnetic power bank that usually costs $99. The MagSafe ecosystem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;may still be a bit underdeveloped&lt;/a&gt;, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TW7BRTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some compelling alternatives from other manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;, but the little battery is a svelte option for juicing up an iPhone 12 or 13 on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1ReJh"&gt;With 1,460mAh and 11.3Wh, the MagSafe battery doesn’t earn its praise on specifications alone, but it has the software integration that no other power bank — magnetic or wired — has, with on-screen animations and charge levels visible, so you know exactly how much charge is left. Not only can it charge certain iPhones, but while it’s recharging via its built-in Lightning port, Dieter Bohn mentioned in his review that it works great as a wired MagSafe charger. You can buy the MagSafe Battery for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/batteries/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15 percent off today at AT&amp;amp;T, bringing the price down to $84&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rNRkiL"&gt;Google’s first-generation Nest Hub makes for a great Google Photos-powered digital picture frame, as well as a basic smart display and speaker in the kitchen or around the house. It features a seven-inch touchscreen and far-field microphones for giving voice commands to the Google Assistant. There is a newer model out now; though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the advancements may not be compelling enough over the original — especially with a discount as big as the one you can get today on the first-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEBxFL"&gt;You can pick up the first-gen Nest Hub at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGURhaeqVs#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1434980-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00515_us_tabletop_smart_screen.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; for just $40. That is a $50 discount off its normal $90 asking price and $60 cheaper than its second-gen replacement. But if you’re more immersed in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem than the Google Assistant, you can also get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; to tackle similar duties, along with video chatting with its built-in camera, for just $5 more. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yZFjuz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782108"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfBECa"&gt;Amazon has a big discount on the large and powerful Gigabyte Aero 15 laptop. This 15.6-inch computer packs a ton of features, including a 4K OLED display, Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU, 1TB SSD, and an 11th-Gen Intel Core i7 processor. It’s billed as a creator laptop, and it will be very capable for Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere, etc., but it can work its way around some AAA games as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeMoH9"&gt;Normally, the Aero 15 goes for $3,000, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-AERO-15-OLED-YD-73US624SP/dp/B093Z1JLHT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;today’s discount has it at an all-time low price of $2,113&lt;/a&gt;. The one caveat to keep in mind is its webcam, which is unfortunately located below the screen for a low-angle view right up your nose. Maybe use a portion of the money you save to budget for a webcam if you’re using Zoom all the time? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255234/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of last year’s model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="uCkr1f"&gt;If you’re in need of charging multiple devices with a whole lot of wattage on tap, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faukeyplus.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower%2Fproducts%2Faukey-omnia-mix3-90w-3-port-pd-charger-pa-b6s-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aukey’s Omnia Mix3 90 watt charger&lt;/a&gt; could be a great option. As its name indicates, it has a mix of three ports to output through: one USB-A port, one USB-C, and a primary USB-C with Power Delivery. The charger is smaller than Apple’s own 87-watt charger but can charge the 16-inch MacBook Pro all the same. If you plug in multiple devices, it will share the 90 watts across them, enough output for a 15-inch laptop and Nintendo Switch simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8BzDI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Faukeyplus.com%2Fcollections%2Fpower%2Fproducts%2Faukey-omnia-mix3-90w-3-port-pd-charger-pa-b6s-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aukey is offering an exclusive price on the Omnia Mix3&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers. Use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE26&lt;/strong&gt; to take 47 percent off at checkout and knock the $56 price down to $30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wkvBLm"&gt;You can never have too many camera bags. That is a universal truth that just about every photographer knows all too well. Today, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1363557-REG%2Fpeak_design_bsl_10_bk_1_everyday_sling_10l_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H has a great price on a very popular and well-regarded bag, the original version of the Peak Design’s Everyday Sling 10L&lt;/a&gt;. The 10L sling from Peak Design is a convenient size and style that easily commutes or travels with a camera, a couple lenses, and still enough room to spare for small items, like a water bottle. You can even squeeze some iPads into it, especially those of the Mini persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7h8ou"&gt;Today’s deal on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1363557-REG%2Fpeak_design_bsl_10_bk_1_everyday_sling_10l_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22701993%2Fapple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Peak Design Everyday Sling 10L is just $70&lt;/a&gt;, saving 53 percent off its normal $150 price tag. Peak Design bags are known for premium quality and premium prices, so this deal is sure to sell out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mAVDjU"&gt;A few quick iPad deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="g5ysyz"&gt;We know iPads can go on sale pretty frequently. Here are a few quick hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Esb1SU"&gt;Walmart has the base &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1157734/9383?subId1=vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10.9-inch iPad Air (2020) with 64GB of storage for $539&lt;/a&gt;. Not its best price ever, but a nice $60 discount with your choice of colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CJPCG7"&gt;The higher capacity &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1157734/9383?subId1=vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=6890999&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A6890999&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Air with 256GB is $100 off&lt;/a&gt;, just $650, also at Walmart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hp6brk"&gt;The ninth-generation &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9CJM1Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad is on sale for $299&lt;/a&gt;, saving $30 on this new base model that just came out. We’ve seen this deal at Walmart prior, but now it’s available at Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
