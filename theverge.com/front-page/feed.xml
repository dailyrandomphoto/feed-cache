    <title>GM says defect-free Bolt batteries are in production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YZmsQVpc9u2veeePP51-eUi77U=/0x0:5700x3800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884253/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEV_008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Chevy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZJT2s2"&gt;LG is once again making batteries for the Chevy Bolt, and General Motors says that it worked closely with the South Korean conglomerate to make sure the new cells are free of defects that have led to at lest a dozen fires in the automaker’s electric vehicle and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;a massive recall&lt;/a&gt;. GM says it will start swapping the new batteries into Bolt EVs in October, though it did not say when it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648922/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-production-halt-recall-fire-risk"&gt;restart production of brand new versions&lt;/a&gt; of the electric car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JmNs8"&gt;Owners of older Bolts (model years 2017 to 2019) will have all the modules in their battery packs swapped for new ones. Owners of newer models may only get individual modules changed out, GM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cw98E0"&gt;GM said Monday that it will also have dealers start installing new diagnostic software on Bolts in the next 60 days. The software will continually scan the battery packs for signs of defects. If none are found, the software will eventually allow owners to once again charge their vehicles to 100 percent, and abandon some of the other safety guidelines GM has put in place while it worked out the recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3805Z0"&gt;The initial fix for the recall, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt;, involved an earlier version of this diagnostic software, though at least two vehicles that received it still caught fire. GM did not go into much detail Monday about how this new software differs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imzpIW"&gt;In the meantime, Bolt owners are supposed to continue adhering to that guidance. GM says owners should park outside and away from their homes after charging, and that they should not charge their vehicles indoors overnight. Owners should not charge their Bolts beyond 90 percent, and avoid depleting the battery below 70 miles of remaining range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdsESZ"&gt;GM made one minor tweak to its guidance, though. As long as they follow the above guidelines, GM says owners need only leave “ample space” between their Bolt and other vehicles, instead 50 feet as it recently advised. It did not define “ample,” though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDbLII"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes is on trial for fraud over her time at Theranos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortune Global Forum - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jd7qe4CVeHAD45_aBIbsj-fSPVI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884166/495430212.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for Fortune&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;12 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3MKqmk"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of disgraced blood testing company Theranos, is being tried for 12 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The trial is expected to last through December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZleF9Y"&gt;Theranos was valued as high as $9 billion, and Holmes was a darling of Silicon Valley, sporting black turtlenecks that prompted comparisons to Steve Jobs. That is, until &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;John Carreyrou’s exposé&lt;/a&gt; was published in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;In that article, Carreyrou wrote that Theranos was using its own device for only a handful of tests and that other employees were concerned that the device wasn’t accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1l27X"&gt;Then it came out that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/problems-found-at-theranos-lab-1453684743"&gt;Theranos’ labs weren’t up to par&lt;/a&gt; and its partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/safeway-theranos-split-after-350-million-deal-fizzles-1447205796"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11919874/walgreens-ends-theranos-blood-testing-partnership"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; fell apart. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;Theranos junked two years’ worth&lt;/a&gt; of test results. Eventually, Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;banned from operating labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/health/theranos-shutting-down.html"&gt;Theranos dissolved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the question is whether Holmes deliberately misled patients and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s big fall hardware event is set for September 28th </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpd5LQ0HgRt9pZDeNl4ZWm-7nJU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883981/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SIKuA"&gt;Amazon has officially announced the date for its big fall hardware event: it’ll take place on Tuesday, September 28th at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. As always, Amazon isn’t giving any details on what to expect — the invite sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; only says that they’ll be “news about our latest Amazon devices, features, and services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5zrSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21450413/amazon-echo-alexa-ring-luna-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;In previous years&lt;/a&gt;, though, Amazon has announced new Echo speakers, updates to Alexa’s software, new Eero routers, updated Ring cameras, and more. Amazon also tends to announce its more unique and experimental products at its fall event: previous years have send the announcement of the Echo Loop ring, the Echo Frames glasses, and the Ring drone (which has yet to make a re-appearance since its initial debut last year.) We may have gotten an early look at Ring’s dash cam as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540298/amazon-ring-car-dash-cam-image-support-article"&gt;when images leaked out this June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orIxel"&gt;The event is invite only, so don’t expect a public livestream, but &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news as soon as it happens on September 28th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP Elite Dragonfly Max review: pretty fly for a steep buy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This laptop is flying business class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OoSpXF"&gt;HP’s Elite Dragonfly Max is the nicest business laptop I’ve ever used. That doesn’t mean it’s the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;, all things considered — when it comes to performance, battery life, and features, the Dragonfly has fierce competition from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22613661/dell-latitude-9420-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Latitudes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPads&lt;/a&gt; of the world. But there’s no business laptop out there that matches the elegance of a Dragonfly. It’s a sleek, light, and beautiful computer — and that beauty is a big part of its hefty, hefty price tag.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3D16D"&gt;Right, the price tag. Before we get into this: The cheapest Dragonfly Max has an MSRP of $3,347 (currently listed at a still-expensive $2,409.84). You can buy my test model for, oh, a discounted price of just $2,622.24. That puts the Dragonfly Max out of reach for most people. And frankly, given the device’s small but noteworthy list of drawbacks, I do think it’s too high. But it’s a gorgeous laptop, it’s really fun to use, and it’s a great case study in the very peak of what a laptop can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Utbn2J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10754422"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0qzdsn"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fmdp%2Felitebook--zbook---probook%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Elite Dragonfly models&lt;/a&gt; you can currently buy: the Dragonfly Max, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-g2-notebook-pc-p-38s12ut-aba-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dragonfly G2&lt;/a&gt;. Both have been upgraded to 11th-Gen Intel processors and DDR4 memory — HP tells me they’re aimed at “mobile users who loved Dragonfly, but want an even faster and smarter device”. There are some new smart features including AI noise reduction for video calls, and new security features like a tamper lock. The Dragonfly Max adds an upgraded 5MP camera, an extra microphone, a blue light shield, a new black color, and a few extra security features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qRMsX"&gt;The other noteworthy difference is that the Dragonfly G2 has a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619889818%26quantity%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;variety of different configurations&lt;/a&gt;: You can choose between five processors, three displays, two batteries, and various types of storage, as well as a number of add-ons, and prices are all across the board. You can make a few adjustments to the Dragonfly Max, but its options are &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619930818%26quantity%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;much more limited&lt;/a&gt; — two processors, one screen, one battery. It’s targeting a very specific deep-pocketed business user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Dragonfly Max keyboard seen from above on a fabric bench.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a seriously impressive keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB 3.1, power button, nano lock slot, and nano SIM slot on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm audio / microphone jack, two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sSmOpv"&gt;One thing to note: all Dragonfly Max models come with Sure View Reflect, one of the Dragonfly line’s biggest calling cards. SureView reflect is a privacy screen that makes it very difficult for potential snoops to see what you’re doing. It’s optional on the G2, and costs an extra $145 over the standard display.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PfuVo"&gt;If you’re not buying the Dragonfly for its suave design, you’re buying it for Sure View Reflect. I’ve tested a few different privacy screens, and Sure View Reflect is hands-down the best one. If I moved my head a bit to the side, or angled the display slightly up or down such that I wasn’t facing it head on, I basically couldn’t make out any of its contents. Someone sitting next to me on a train or even peering over my shoulder would’ve had trouble gleaning any info. It’s an impressive feature, and doesn’t visibly impact screen brightness or glare much at all. (Of course, if you’re in a situation where you’ll be collaborating or moving your head around a lot, you can always turn the feature off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7VCA2"&gt;Sure View aside, the Dragonfly Max’s touch display is quite accurate and vivid, and delivers a whopping 1,000 nits of brightness — a number that’s unusual for anything that’s not a devastatingly expensive business laptop to reach. (Enabling Sure View will dim the display, of course.) It’s compatible with HP’s Wacom AES 2.0 pen, which is (frustratingly) not shipped with the device, as it did with previous Dragonfly generations. It costs an extra $74. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJl1e3"&gt;I do have a couple other complaints. For one, the screen is 16:9, which is falling out of fashion on expensive laptops for a reason. Lenovo has adopted the roomier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623290/thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs"&gt;16:10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22642876/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-windows-price-specs"&gt;3:2&lt;/a&gt; aspect ratios on a number of its premium ThinkPads, and HP should do the same with the Dragonfly. Both offer more vertical space and a more comfortable multitasking experience. Additionally, the screen picks up fingerprints and smudges very easily, and they weren’t trivial to wipe off. These aren’t as visible as they would be on a dimmer screen, but they did cheapen my viewing experience a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ak7GWu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My picture was a bit washed out with the light from my window&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uzb5Yh"&gt;The other reason you might want the Max over the G2 is its upgraded camera. The Dragonfly Max has a 5MP webcam with a separate infrared sensor. Webcams are often a weak point of otherwise-stellar laptops, and this webcam certainly improves upon the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It does a better job in low light than I’m used to seeing from webcams, and colors were fairly accurate. Coworkers on a Zoom call remarked that they could make out surprisingly minute details of my feed: strands of hair, my nose stud, etc. Of course, that doesn’t mean it delivers a &lt;em&gt;great &lt;/em&gt;picture — my picture was a bit washed out with the light from my window, and there was still noticeable noise. It’s a good experience, but not something I’d buy the Dragonfly Max just to get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI5wvK"&gt;The webcam also has a physical shutter that’s easy to click back and forth (though it’s tiny and black, so finding it takes a bit of guesswork). The separate IR sensor means Windows Hello facial recognition works even when the shutter is closed. You can also sign in with the fingerprint reader located below the right arrow key, which didn’t give me any trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOe0sw"&gt;Paired with the webcam are four microphones (two front-facing and two back-facing) with AI noise cancelation. These picked up my voice just fine in video conferences, and can be killed easily with the F8 key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Dragonfly Max closed seen from above on a fabric bench." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzP7mwEGg-Lm2njP4cxpG0GC4Iw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864076/akrales_210917_4733_0055.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noise cancelation is driven by a “deep neural network”, HP says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="h1de3h"&gt;HP continues including sustainable material in its high-end laptops, though its current pronouncements are slightly more conservative than they have been in past years. As was the case on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;first-gen Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt;, the keyboard is made from 50 percent PCR DVDs, and 80 percent of mechanical parts are recycled material. The Max’s bezels are 45 precent post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and five percent ocean-bound plastics — the early-2020 Dragonfly’s bezels were 35 percent PCR plastic. But some of the Max’s other pronouncements are a bit of a step down from the previous Dragonfly. The speaker enclosures are 45 percent PCR plastics and five percent ocean-bound plastics, while the previous Dragonfly’s speaker box was 50 percent PCR plastics and five percent ocean-bound plastics. And 90 percent of the Dragonfly Max’s cover is recycled magnesium, while the previous Dragonfly’s entire chassis was 90 percent recycled. Still, it’s nice to see HP pursuing sustainability with its high-end lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXzQ5Q"&gt;The good news for shoppers, though, is that the recycled materials do nothing to cheapen the chassis. The Dragonfly Max has a smooth and comfortable texture, and feels quite sturdy. It has a striking, premium look rivaled only by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s own Spectre line&lt;/a&gt; in recent months. A hallmark of cheap plastic is that it accumulates fingerprints very quickly, but the Dragonfly remained smudge-free after over a week of testing. (The lid picked up a few, but they were only visible under bright light and were easily wiped away.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Elite Dragonfly Max webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pH5yRvP4UEWosUF42xzu7GGg2mU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864074/akrales_210917_4733_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shutter is satisfying to click back and forth absentmindedly if you’re fidgety like me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KaeAyy"&gt;Open the device up, and you’ll find a dizzying list of security features targeting C-suites and IT departments. New to these Dragonfly models is a tamper lock, which is meant to detect when a potential hacker has popped the chassis open to fiddle with components — if this occurs, the PC will require a BIOS password to be entered before it boots again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXwYQe"&gt;Within the OS is Sure Click, a secure browser that opens websites within a CPU-isolated virtual machine. That means any malware you pick up while using Sure Click will be isolated from the rest of your system, and will disappear when you close the browser. It also offers protected viewing for PDFs and Office documents. I dinked around with it, and it was very easy to use, and conveniently ported over all my bookmarks. It has a slightly different color scheme from regular Chrome, so I never mixed up my tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adbG6z"&gt;The device comes preloaded with a laundry list of other software. There’s Sure Sense, which scans every file you download for malware, and can detect “zero day never-before-seen threats”, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fh20195.www2.hp.com%2Fv2%2FGetDocument.aspx%3Fdocname%3D4AA7-7264ENW&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;per HP&lt;/a&gt;. There’s Sure Run, which keeps crucial processes running if malware tries to shut them down. There’s Easy Clean, which can temporarily disable the Dragonfly’s keyboard, touchscreen, and touchpad so you (or someone else) can wipe it down without accidentally booting it up. And there’s a Tile tracker inside, which you can use to locate the Dragonfly Max if you lose it via Tile’s massive crowd-finding network. It’s easy to set up and use, especially if you already have a Tile account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP Elite Dragonfly Max seen from the front, open, on a fabric bench. The screen displays an orange, blue, and purple gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVMXPVRNlFoOatZ1EWvgXZOii0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864071/akrales_210917_4733_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The finish is “Sparkling Black”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="wsGiw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10754438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="S93JAs"&gt;Those are just the standout features of the Dragonfly Max — everything else about it is also hard to beat. It supports Wi-Fi 6 and optional 5G. It’s quite light, at just 2.49 pounds and 0.63 inches thick. The audio (via two upward-firing and two downward-firing speakers) is excellent, with bass and percussion that are audible, if not strong. The keyboard is a delight, with just the right amount of click and travel. There’s a surprisingly robust port selection for such a thin machine, including two Thunderbolt 4, one combo audio jack, one HDMI 2.0, one USB 3.1, one nano lock slot, and one nano SIM slot. And the chassis never got uncomfortably hot, nor were the fans ever loud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUBEFt"&gt;The processor — a Core i7-1185G7 with support for Intel’s vPro, did a good job with all kinds of tasks, including heaps upon heaps of tabs and videos. I only saw a minor slowdown once, when I was using the Battery Saver profile and trying to jump between Slack and Chrome while running a Zoom call in the background. Switching off Battery Saver nipped that in the bud. Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics can lend a hand in GPU-intensive tasks or games like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, though you wouldn’t want to use the Dragonfly as a primary gaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38G9Ac"&gt;Battery life, though, was my biggest disappointment. I took the Dragonfly Max through my normal workday, juggling around a dozen Chrome tabs with some Spotify or YouTube streaming and Zoom calls on medium brightness with Battery Saver on, and it lasted an average of seven and a half hours. That result was remarkably consistent within 20 or so minutes, regardless of battery profile or what I did with Sure View. That’s not a devastating result, and it means the Dragonfly Max can make it through close to a full day if your workload is similar to mine. But it’s disappointing considering the competition — I got over 11 and a half hours out of the previous Dragonfly, and the Dell Latitude 9420 broke 10 while on the Battery Saver profile. And, of course, all kinds of more affordable consumer laptops can last much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP logo on the HP Elite Dragonfly Max bottom bezel." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LrU85Fu-nsLhA7tcz9bEXNwKnec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864075/akrales_210917_4733_0046.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gorgeous, high-priced commitment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="EyZDFU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10754444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8RV5Z9"&gt;The Dragonfly is a great machine to buy, if you can afford it. I especially don’t begrudge IT departments for taking a look — businesses often buy these things in bulk and aren’t paying full price. Almost every aspect is good, and there are features you really can’t get anywhere else. If you’re looking for a combination of an embedded Tile tracker, an effective privacy screen, a 2.49-pound chassis, and a 5MP webcam with a separate infrared sensor, the Dragonfly Max is basically your only option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHTJgH"&gt;But given how much money HP is asking for this thing, I can’t help but look at even mild drawbacks with a fairly critical eye. I don’t need a laptop to be completely flawless in order to recommend that you spend over $2,400 on it (or upwards of $3,000, depending on the day) — I’m willing to forgive a squeaky keyboard or an oddly-placed port here and there. But I do need it to have all-day battery life. I need its screen not to be covered in smudges. In this year 2021, I need it not to be 16:9. And, yes, I probably do need it to ship with a stylus. For that reason, I think most consumers are probably better suited to the regular G2, which starts &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-g2-notebook-pc-p-38s12ut-aba-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22675550%2Fhp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $1,819&lt;/a&gt; and is much more customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Og3K3q"&gt;The Max is a luxury product, at the end of the day. It’s not so much a pragmatic purchase (for most of us) as it is a proof of concept — what could a laptop be if money were no object? The answer, as it turns out, is: very nice, and very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next pro iPhone might finally ditch the notch</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTwYqxvSUZFA7Cc6MW8n3z-HDfM=/0x131:1960x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883867/Apple_iPhone_13_Pro_Colors_09142021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9vJ2u"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679747/apple-iphone-13-pro-mini-max-video-feature-tour"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; isn’t even here yet, but speculation about Apple’s future phones never slows down. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;some rumors about Apple’s event last week didn’t pan out&lt;/a&gt;, certain leaks were right on, including analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;information about a smaller notch and high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDUyx8"&gt;Now Kuo reports (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-to-feature-hole-punch-design-new-48mp-wide-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-hole-punch-48mp-camera/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that plans for next year’s iPhones point to high-end Pro and Pro Max models that ditch the notch entirely in favor of hole-punch front cameras, with 48MP wide cameras on the back. However, Kuo expects that in-screen fingerprint scanning for Touch ID is off until 2023, despite his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754520/iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-2021-iphones-face-id-biometric-security-rumors"&gt;earlier reporting&lt;/a&gt; that it could happen as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iVwJIh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The iPhone’s notch: should it stay or should it go?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678603/iphone-13-notch-2021-face-id-touch-id"},{"title":"iPhone 13 deals are extra aggressive this year, here’s why","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jZWAMA"&gt;A possible foldable iPhone is even further off, slipping from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;previous projection of 2023&lt;/a&gt; to 2024 at the earliest. More immediately, Kuo reiterates expectations of a 5G-equipped iPhone SE next spring and a larger non-Pro version of the iPhone 14 that offers the 6.7-inch frame without the extra Pro features and price bump.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scammers allegedly earned $195,000 referring fake drivers to delivery apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pk0qJXkKa0ji7QXHNzVExDetFak=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883815/uber-stock-0865.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7DlEGm"&gt;The Justice Department has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/fourteen-brazilian-nationals-charged-identity-theft-nationwide-rideshare-and-delivery"&gt;charged over a dozen people&lt;/a&gt; with running a scam on ride hailing and delivery apps. Prosecutors say the alleged scam ring created fake accounts using stolen personal information, then sold those accounts to otherwise unqualified drivers — while also collecting referral bonuses and building software to trick the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P00gRr"&gt;The indictment was revealed on Friday and adds to wire fraud claims &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/nineteen-brazilian-nationals-charged-nationwide-conspiracy-open-fraudulent-driver"&gt;first revealed in May&lt;/a&gt;. It accuses 14 people — all Brazilian nationals and most living in Massachusetts — with identity theft against five unnamed companies. (Prosecutors filed the wire fraud charges against 19 people in total, and 16 have been arrested.) The wire fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the aggravated identity theft charges carry a sentence of at least 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zY0pwj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They allegedly used alcohol orders as an excuse to scan users’ driver’s licenses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkzPvU"&gt;Court documents outline a complicated fraud scheme involving bots, GPS spoofing, social security numbers bought on dark web sites, and driver’s licenses copied from unwitting app users. While the apps in question aren’t named, the complaint’s details &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5dv9/hacking-ring-allegedly-stole-americans-identities-rented-them-to-gig-workers"&gt;match problems&lt;/a&gt; identified on Instacart and Amazon Flex among other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15zlDg"&gt;From around January of 2019 to April of 2021, the group’s members allegedly told customers (falsely) that they needed to scan their driver’s licenses when delivering alcohol. Prosecutors say defendants altered the photos on the licenses, paired them with other personal information, and started accounts that they could sell or rent to drivers. The fake accounts also allegedly helped the group collect referral bonuses that could reach $1,000 apiece — one message shows a delivery company paid $194,800 after getting referrals for 487 fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3edYl"&gt;The conspiracy allegedly broadened when the group bought software that it could rent to drivers, helping them automatically snag orders through bots or spoof locations to make trips appear longer.  As &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/page/file/1392526/download"&gt;an affidavit notes&lt;/a&gt;, the group reportedly advertised its fake accounts to Brazilian nationals working in Massachusetts. It doesn’t detail exactly who bought the accounts, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580094/facebook-bike-messenger-group-undocumented-support-delivery-drivers"&gt;many ride-hailing and delivery workers are undocumented immigrants&lt;/a&gt; who could have trouble meeting application requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDC6jf"&gt;Software tools have helped people circumvent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;opaque and exploitative&lt;/a&gt; features like &lt;a href="https://entrecourier.com/delivery/delivery-strategies/delivery-tools/will-para-tip-transparency-make-more-money-or-get-you-deactivated/"&gt;DoorDash hiding tips from workers&lt;/a&gt;. But these tools (typically) don’t come with a side of identity theft — and bots and hackers are &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg839d/hacks-bots-and-the-pandemic-have-fueled-a-racist-class-war-on-instacart"&gt;a well-known plague&lt;/a&gt; for workers and customers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US agencies reportedly split over blacklisting Huawei hardware spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCGCsZ76o3lyWOZMBnMu34AhQvc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883797/acastro_190521_1777_huawei_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iLkG06"&gt;Federal agencies like the Pentagon and Commerce Departments can’t decide whether to place Huawei’s former smartphone company, Honor, on the US’s export blacklist, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/huawei-honor-security-export/2021/09/19/6d49d27c-17ef-11ec-b976-f4a43b740aeb_story.html"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7lkEH"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;, top officials at the Commerce, State, and Energy departments, along with the Pentagon, met last week to decide whether to place the smartphone manufacturer on the US’s entity list. Pentagon and Energy staffers supported placing the company on the list while Commerce and State Department officials opposed the idea. If blacklisted, Honor would be unable to receive US tech exports without a license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KG8Zne"&gt;Huawei launched Honor in China in 2013 to compete against other popular smartphone companies like Xiaomi. Nearly three years later, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/16/12492310/huawei-smartphone-brand-honor-us"&gt;Huawei announced that the Honor 8&lt;/a&gt; would be available in the US — a test to see whether the company could bring its huge Chinese popularity overseas and become a competitive threat to companies like Apple. Last month, Honor announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621367/honor-magic-3-pro-plus-price-specs-features-cameras"&gt;first flagship phones&lt;/a&gt; since being sold off from Huawei, arriving first in China to be released globally at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrYcjU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The agency divide over Honor shows how the Biden administration is struggling to address the US’s competitive threats against China&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PoHFnf"&gt;The agency divide over Honor shows how the Biden administration is struggling to address the US’s competitive threats against China. In 2019, the Trump administration kicked off this fight by declaring Huawei, one of the world’s largest telecommunications and technology makers, a national security threat. Later, Huawei’s Chief Finance Officer Meng Wanzhou &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201023/us-charges-huawei-fraud-stealing-t-mobile-justice-department"&gt;was indicted for bank and wire fraud&lt;/a&gt; and is currently awaiting an extradition ruling in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cv5PC"&gt;Republican lawmakers have been pushing the Biden administration to use export controls like the Commerce Department’s entity list to curb China’s rise as a competitive threat in the tech industry. Last month, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) &lt;a href="https://gop-foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-china-task-force-members-ask-for-honor-device-co-to-be-added-to-the-entity-list/"&gt;led a letter&lt;/a&gt; with more than a dozen other lawmakers calling on Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to place Honor on the entity list, accusing Huawei’s January sale of the company as equating to “export control evasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCA0mF"&gt;According to Huawei, the sale was prompted in part due to the Trump administration’s 2019 entity listing which &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;made it more difficult&lt;/a&gt; for the company to purchase the software licenses and processors needed to build the Honor devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6bbhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1VRoD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s latest updates lay good groundwork, but don’t add many big new features&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwF119"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 are strange updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="2SHpRr"&gt;Some iOS updates bring huge new features; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872972/apple-ios-13-review-iphone-update-dark-mode-arcade-maps-photos-siri"&gt;iOS 13 had dark mode&lt;/a&gt; (and a lot of bugs) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;iOS 14 had widgets&lt;/a&gt;. Some, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri"&gt;like iOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, brought much needed behind-the-scenes fixes to performance and battery life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="tVZDfx"&gt;But iOS 15 (and its companion, iPadOS 15) does neither. It’s the most incremental and iterative iOS release in years, a grab bag of new features that, while nice to have, don’t really move the needle or change your iPhone experience much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="To4UOa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763173"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AWaE3Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNMjZe"&gt;Looking at the changes and additions in Apple’s latest mobile software, there’s not much to point to in major design changes or UI overhauls; at the same time, Apple doesn’t seem to have made the kind of game-changing performance and battery life improvements that defined quieter updates like iOS 12, or iOS 10’s changes to how it lets third-party apps hook into the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zzBk8T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most incremental and iterative iOS release in years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yKiKTb"&gt;It doesn’t help, of course, that some of the biggest and most interesting features coming to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 aren’t actually here at launch. The flashy SharePlay feature has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;delayed to later this fall&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt; — presumably on deck for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey’s&lt;/a&gt; release — hasn’t even popped up to try in beta yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFhSgZ"&gt;Other big features are still in the works, too: the new detailed 3D view for Apple Maps is limited to just New York, London, San Francisco, and Los Angeles at launch, while iCloud Plus’ VPN-like Private Relay will &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-now-considered-a-beta-feature-comes-disabled-by-default-with-ios-15/"&gt;start off as a beta feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Glbkx"&gt;iOS 15 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;already a relatively minor release&lt;/a&gt;, but those delays and omissions leave what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; here at launch feeling even more anemic. It’s not a new vision for Apple’s mobile software as much as a bit of fresh paint and polish for what’s already been here, to the point where it’d probably be fair to call it iOS 14.5 (if Apple hadn’t already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;released that earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPAmcE"&gt;Apple’s updates are occasionally hit or miss (looking at you, iOS 13), so before we dive into features, a word on performance and stability: Functionally, the two new releases work well; I haven’t run into any major issues with performance or battery life on the final version of the software. (I will caveat this note by saying that I’ve been testing the new OSes on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;M1 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, so performance issues here would be an ominous sign.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxhQxn"&gt;With that out of the way, let’s dive into features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hh2fSp"&gt;Coming soon to a FaceTime near you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ur6vlt"&gt;With SharePlay not shipping with the initial iOS 15 release, this fall’s update is (at least for now) missing out on its biggest and flashiest feature. FaceTime itself is getting some updates unrelated to SharePlay, though, chief of which is the ability to create a link to a FaceTime call that you can send to Windows and Android users (who can join through a web browser). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="43CkgQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FaceTime’s bigger updates are coming later this fall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wEJtSt"&gt;There is also the equally long-overdue grid view, which (combined with the new links) makes FaceTime much more of a viable group video chat solution than it was before. Also added are some new audio features to help your phone better zero in on who’s speaking and a blurred background portrait mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HgTrB"&gt;Even with the new additions here, I don’t think FaceTime is going to replace Zoom or Google Meet as a business solution (nor do I think that’s Apple’s goal here), but iOS 15 does make it much easier to use FaceTime for more casual calls with multiple participants — even if it’s mostly playing catchup here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lC6Po5"&gt;Going on Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="J6ftea"&gt;When it comes to changes that will impact virtually every iPhone owner, Safari’s update is the most significant thing in iOS 15. The browser is getting an Apple-wide redesign across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (the latter coming as part of macOS Monterey later this fall), and it’s the biggest visual change in this year’s update by far. It’s also the most controversial new piece of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, to the point where Apple has added the ability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;to opt out&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;most of the changes here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmGO2yAGQXC3WV86tKK_t91wI7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863816/Image_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;iOS 15’s biggest change comes to Safari, which has a whole new design.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="teQjFI"&gt;On the iPhone, the default view is still Apple’s new “tab bar” mode, which places the URL bar at the bottom of the display and allows you to swipe between open tabs (similar to swiping between apps on a Face ID iPhone). The relocated URL bar is definitely an adjustment, but after a few weeks, I’ve mostly come around to the new design — being able to swipe between tabs is useful, and Apple’s fixed the behavior of the URL bar so that it stays at the bottom of the page. That said, if you prefer the old style, you can easily switch over to it in the Settings app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="l8I58x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new look for Safari&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2ehQm"&gt;The iPad also gets a new, swipeable tab bar, although it’s located at the top of the display (Apple calls it a “Compact Tab Bar”). Unlike on the iPhone, I much prefer Apple’s old design here, which keeps the URL bar on top and a row of tabs underneath it; the scrolling compact bar is harder to use, and has the unfortunate habit of obscuring the rest of your open tabs whenever you click on it. (Incidentally, it seems that Apple agrees the design wasn’t optimal, as the legacy style “Separate Tab Bar” is the default here.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljaq1k"&gt;Design choices aside, the new version of Safari also adds a new tab group feature (which syncs between devices through iCloud) to help sort the chaos of all your open websites across your devices, and the ability to install third-party extensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50eQwD"&gt;You can still install a different browser if you’d like (and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444995/ios-14-default-browsers-chrome-edge-firefox-duckduckgo-safari"&gt;set it as a default&lt;/a&gt;), but since iOS 15 still keeps Apple’s limits on requiring all third-party browsers to use Safari’s rendering engine, you still won’t see any performance differences; just a new UI or different cross-platform syncing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7c3fam"&gt;Focus up&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LAahp2fBneoOSZejeQl1_UNz2ds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863908/Image_5.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Focus modes can filter out your notifications for you.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mRH8oZ"&gt;On the flip side of things is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;Focus modes&lt;/a&gt;, something that I suspect will be ignored by a lot of iOS users. Effectively a souped-up version of Apple’s existing Do Not Disturb, Focus modes let you establish specific apps and contacts to ping you at specific times. But it’s a lot more useful than that: Focus modes can intelligently trigger at times of day or at geographic locations, and toggle specific home screen layouts. You can also let iOS 15 intelligently switch Focus modes based on when it thinks you’ll want them on or off, but the automated switching is very hit or miss.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bJdiz"&gt;Practically, I’ve been using Focus modes to create a “Personal” mode that shuts off notifications from Slack, my work email, Google Calendar, and anything else that might pull me back online during weekends or evenings, and it works amazingly well. A “Work” focus mode, on the flip side, kicks in whenever I’m at &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; office or during work hours and does the reverse, shutting down Instagram notifications so I can focus (pun intended) on my job. It also swaps in a new home screen with calendar and email widgets, and quick access to things like my 2FA app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTSdiu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Focus is Apple’s smartest new feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCJj1v"&gt;When you’re in a Focus mode, notifications that come in filter though in a separate bundle (which you can view in the notifications drop down, should you want to double check that nothing’s on fire at work). Apple will also let apps send “time sensitive” notifications that break through Focus limits, for things like your bank urgently letting you know that someone made a withdrawal or if someone rings your video doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol9fg3"&gt;It’s a smarter version of Apple’s previous efforts to make users more conscious of how and when they’re using their phones, recognizing that there might be times when you only want to use some of your phone, without the binary on / off mode that Do Not Disturb is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Wm2CtK"&gt;A smarter smartphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cc5vvf"&gt;Apple’s been beating the local machine-learning drum for years, and iOS 15 has two of its most significant moves in that direction yet: Live Text and offline Siri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i16ZXF"&gt;Live Text still works like it does in the beta, which is to say impressively well. You can point your camera at any text, be it handwritten or typed, and Live Text will pull that information into copyable text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RN89KRuNmOYH8ceWxGlB-XjQagw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864016/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_10.01.29_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An example of all the places that Live Text can work and pull text from.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8aANtv"&gt;Live Text works system-wide too: in the camera app, with photos you’ve saved, in Safari, and even in most text fields, you can tap and hold to pull up a “live text” icon in the same pop-up menu that copy / paste commands live in to snag text directly into a message or email. It’s extremely technically impressive, but in the months I’ve been using iOS 15, I haven’t run into many practical applications for it in my day-to-day life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkkjYT"&gt;Siri also now processes speech entirely on device, allowing (theoretically) more secure and faster interactions, as well as offline Siri commands for the first time. Those are obviously limited in what they can do, but you can kick your phone into airplane mode and still accomplish basic tasks like opening apps, setting timers, and toggling settings. I didn’t notice Siri working dramatically faster in my experience, but the added benefits are nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="pgGxsG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10763113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tskkEm"&gt;iOS 15 also marks the rollout of an upgraded version of Apple’s iCloud service, iCloud Plus. The new subscription service is bundled with existing paid iCloud storage subscriptions, and adds a few new features. There’s a new “Hide My Email” service, which creates burner email addresses that forward to your regular account — similar to a feature offered with Sign In With Apple, but one that you can use for services that don’t work with Apple’s login feature. iCloud Plus expands Apple’s unlimited HomeKit Secure Video storage to more of its plan (the base $0.99 / month plan, in particular, is now included) and lets you have an unlimited number of security cameras pipe into it with the 2TB plan (it was limited to just five before). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zp2QKX"&gt;The biggest feature though, is Private Relay, a VPN-style service that aims to mask your internet traffic from your iPhone. There are a few caveats, though, that separate Apple’s version from a true VPN. First is that you can’t use Private Relay to spoof your location (say, for sports or streaming content), since the service only allows you to anonymize your data within your country and time zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CiNsHv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A6KQxX"&gt;Second is that it only works in Safari, not other apps or browsers. And lastly, the service isn’t available in several countries, including China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines for regulatory reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo1mN3"&gt;Private Relay also isn’t quite ready to go, either: Apple is releasing the feature as a “public beta” to start in iOS 15. It’ll be disabled by default (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;although it’s simple to turn on&lt;/a&gt;) as Apple works to get more feedback and make sure everything works properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MeO5HY"&gt;The best of the rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XtUEmw"&gt;Apple Maps is rolling out a very fancy looking new 3D map. The new, more detailed maps look great, but they’re &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; limited. At launch, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and London are supposed to be available, but I’ve only seen the new look in the two California cities so far. The additions are nice: trees, bridges, and major buildings now appear in Apple’s stylized 3D view, and streets even show individual lanes when you zoom in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SRD0b2qULBL65TdJu_fLyZzmTZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863909/Image__1__2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Maps looks better than ever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t7n07n"&gt;There are also new AR directions, better transit directions, and improved driving directions (which use the aforementioned improved maps) to help make sure you’re taking the right lane. A lot of this is stuff that Google has offered for a while, but for those who prefer Apple Maps, it’s good to see that Apple is working to stay up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCcO3v"&gt;The built-in Weather app has a new design after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;Apple’s purchase of Dark Sky&lt;/a&gt;, adding Dark Sky-style gradient bars for temperature, a Dark Sky-style precipitation notice for the next hour, and Dark Sky-style maps for temperature, precipitation, and temperature. There are also some flashy new animations: a thunderstorm will light up the app with lightning flashes, and rain will bounce off the top of the UI’s boxes and run down the sides of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6x5ScMpN5SxPPFWUP6IFEtTwF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863910/Image_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new overhauled Dark Sky-style Weather app in iOS 15.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2DtSI7"&gt;Despite the Dark Sky purchase, though, Apple is still relying on a combination of first-party data, The Weather Channel, and other third-party sources for its forecasts (even though Dark Sky produced its own weather data API in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDvWel"&gt;Both the Notes and Reminders have a newly added tag system, along with smart folders that can automatically pull in those notes and reminders using those tags. As someone whose Notes app in particular has become an endless pit of hastily jotted down text, it’s a useful addition (although it’ll be even better once macOS rolls out and I can access them on my computer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZdo7T"&gt;Memoji have clothing now. It’s that kind of update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2KtkH"&gt;There’s a new “Shared with You” section that’s been added to several of Apple’s apps, including Photos, Music, Safari, Podcasts, and Apple TV Plus. It’s a useful reminder of Apple’s vice grip over core services on your phone. If people send you links, photos, Apple Music songs, TV Plus shows, Apple News articles, or podcasts, those pieces of media will now be highlighted in Apple’s corresponding apps. The links and photo aspects are the most useful, surfacing old pictures that friends and family members had sent me over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAfFgM1OAMxhTf-_cCy0NmXYMD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863954/Untitled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Shared with You pulls links from Messages into a helpful area in Safari.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkG3YO"&gt;But it’s a very Apple kind of feature: only things sent in Messages will appear, and only Apple apps will work. If a friend sends a link to an Apple Music playlist over iMessage, you’ll see it in the Music app. If they send it over WhatsApp, though, or share a Spotify song instead, you’re out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRcLzd"&gt;Some things still haven’t changed from iOS 14, either: App Library still won’t let you move around or edit app categories, so you’re stuck with whatever Apple classifies apps as. Default app support hasn’t meaningfully advanced from the additions of email and web browsers last year, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hjrSNM"&gt;iPadOS 15-specific updates&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3wMe0aBSVratPby4IXwp-x6BsY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864030/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cKW05z"&gt;As I noted back in my beta hands-on over the summer, iPadOS 15 is virtually identical to iOS 15, except for a few iPad-specific improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqJZTO"&gt;Two (mostly) welcome changes are the addition of the widget and App Library system added to the iPhone in iOS 14. Where last year’s iPad update added widgets, they could only be viewed in a specific area on the left of the home screen; now, though, iPad users get the same home-screen widgets that iOS has had for a year, along with the App Library feature (so you can hide apps without deleting them entirely). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DF1M6W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Widgets and App Library finally come to the iPad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="txKT7X"&gt;Apple is offering an even bigger widget size option for the iPad, though, which takes up an entire third of the screen in a four-icon by two-icon grid and is physically about the same size as an iPhone 12 when viewed on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Given that iOS widgets still aren’t allowed to be fully interactive, it’s not the most useful addition, but you can get truly massive calendar previews and contact lists. So far, the best implementation is the Photos app, which can act as a sizable photo frame on your home screen now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4kkzX"&gt;As a side effect of the expanded widget support, though, Apple bewilderingly reduced the number of icons you can have on an iPad home screen in iPadOS 15. On a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 6x5 grid for icons gets bumped down to a 4x6 grid the second you add a widget, giving the tablets the same layout as an iPhone when incorporating widgets into a home screen layout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rc6Fd"&gt;I’m not entirely sure what Apple’s thinking here is — visual cohesion across devices, perhaps — but the net result is that a 12.9-inch iPad can display approximately the same amount of icons on a home screen as a 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="csMfnT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10763118"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcPA2F"&gt;The other big iPad-specific change here is in how Apple handles multitasking. As I noted over the summer, Apple is largely sticking with its existing system, built primarily on split-screened applications and floating sidebars.  What is new, here, though, is a multitasking menu that’s designed to make it easier to set up (or exit out of) split-screen app views, or to move an app into a hovering sidebar view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vda8Q"&gt;There’s also a new “shelf” view, which appears as a sort of in-app dock that shows all the open windows you currently have open for a specific app, similar to the Control-Down command on a Mac. The app shelf pops up whenever you open an app, or when you tap the multitasking bar, and helps make it easier to wrangle different app windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FF4Af9N1315jqutZsvpK1yH_Hig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863833/Image_3.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The updated Safari on iOS 15, along with a look at the new multitasking bar and shelf view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IzQCb"&gt;Notes on the iPad is getting a new Quick Note feature, which is tailor-made for the Apple Pencil — swipe up from the corner of the screen, and you can jot down a quick note (as the name implies). It pairs really nicely with last year’s handwriting recognition additions, too. On the flip side, it’s another flavor of pop-over window in an OS that already has enough modal things going on without a great way to organize them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN4sap"&gt;After using an iPad with the final version of iPadOS 15 for a few weeks, though, it’s clearer than ever that even with the new changes, it’s still the same old iPad multitasking. My thoughts haven’t changed from when I first tried an early beta this summer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oNcEcq"&gt;iPadOS remains unpredictable: I’m never 100 percent sure what version of an open app or app windows will open when I tap in on my home screen. Just opening a new window is still an opaque process that involves dragging and dropping things around in split view. Slide-over panels still live in their own, separate confusing world. Split view is still frustratingly rigid, letting you have exactly two apps open with a third visible as a slide-over panel, instead of any other configuration (like one large app on the left and two smaller ones on the right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xyf6yH"&gt;Ultimately, the new multitasking and split-screen views are a refinement of the older system, rather than some grand new paradigm for how to use an iPad. Those who like the iPad’s software abilities will likely find the new additions and enhancements to those modes nice. But those who were hoping that iPadOS 15 would offer a wildly overhauled windowing system — especially in the wake of Apple’s M1 upgrade in the latest iPad Pro — are going to be disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;There’s still a LOT going on with iPadOS 15’s multitasking, though.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N6OLHz"&gt;The most interesting feature coming to iPadOS, however, is Universal Control, which promises a new, seamless way to jump back and forth between a Mac and an iPad using a single mouse and keyboard. It’s the sort of thing that could offer users the best of both worlds of Apple’s computing vision, but we’ll have to wait to see how it actually works later this year; it’s not shipping yet, or even available to try in a beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMxFso"&gt;And, since this is an iPadOS review, I have to note that, once again, Apple has refused to add multi-user support in iOS 15, a feature that it offers on both macOS devices and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/multiple-users-atvb59ec8e2e/tvos"&gt;Apple TVs running tvOS&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also no weather app (despite Apple now owning a company that makes an iPad weather app), no calculator app, and — especially relevant for anyone with ideas of using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;new iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; as a defacto smartphone — no phone app. Maybe next year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4RGpdhn1EZPFJNxXWF-RHnMAg4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864738/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="B2a3HU"&gt;Here’s the good news: your phone or tablet will not be worse off for installing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Unless you really, really hate Apple’s new Safari design (which, following a series of beta changes, are less dramatic in the final version than when they were first revealed), it will likely be better. But the ways that iOS and iPadOS are improving are smaller than ever. The new features are more subtle, and the changes — while still helpful improvements generally — won’t really change how you use your phone or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imB4bn"&gt;I noted in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;initial preview earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it felt like a lot of these changes were simply being saved up for a big fall release, even if it would have been possible and made more sense to release them earlier (like many of the FaceTime features, which would have come in handy during the earlier, even more isolated stage of the COVID-19 pandemic). But on the other hand, had Apple done that, it’s hard to see what it could have used as the centerpoint of its Big Annual Software Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pzeSxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;After a decade and a half of OS updates, there’s simply fewer things to left to fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfSS5R"&gt;And maybe that’s the point. iOS is now on its 15th major version, a number that doesn’t count significant point releases (which have been tending towards more substantial updates in their own right). Apple has spent a lot of time making it into a great mobile operating system, but after a decade and a half of improvements, updates, and tweaks, there’s less it needs to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B553my"&gt;As the saying goes, if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it, and 15 versions in, there’s not a lot left in iOS that needs to be fixed. There’s almost certainly going to be bigger iOS updates in the future, massive platform changes like iOS 7 or macOS High Sierra that rethink what the iPhone looks like and works like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gAbPNy"&gt;But those inflection points are few and far between, and the future of iOS updates will probably look more like iOS 15: smaller and subtler. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 deals are extra aggressive this year, here’s why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3_zMQMnkK42DgY00r3QevGnIqA=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882128/lcimg_78e65da1_4e90_4b7e_a300_6bce2342e8ea.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px24Oy"&gt;“You get free iPhone upgrades for life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzwceT"&gt;“You get a $500 gift card for switching carriers!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buZXND"&gt;I can almost hear Oprah shouting the many competing offers from all the carriers — AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon — as soon as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was over. They’re all offering huge incentives to entice you to trade-in an old device, switch carriers, then sign up for a top-shelf cellular plan. If you’re in the market for a new carrier and iPhone right now, you can probably land yourself a “free” iPhone 13 (or only pay a nominal fee for the flagship iPhone 13 Pro Max), even if you’re preordering before the phones hit stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwjtSF"&gt;Many of these offers seem too good to be true and are a bit surprising to see on new iPhones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;historically have sold themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Who can ignore Verizon for giving you a $500 prepaid MasterCard gift card, just for ditching your carrier? How about the sky-high trade-in offers that all the carriers are advertising, like the too-good-to-be-true offer of giving you $350 for a used Samsung A50, which retails about $180? Across the board, the carriers are particularly aggressive with their signup offers this year, as detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;in our preorder guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D05T4he8paoSK__to_e-rJJhEN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858831/lcimg_17b9e15c_0998_429c_bb51_493611b203d6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s pricing for the new iPhone 13 models isn’t out of the ordinary — but few people will actually pay that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n0jSDK"&gt;Whether you choose T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&amp;amp;T, all the offers fit the same basic premise. In exchange for a discount on the newest iPhone 13 device, after you trade-in an older device for whatever value, you’ll be paying for the balance of your device in monthly installments. You also must qualify and sign up for a typically more expensive unlimited plan that ties you to your phone and carrier for at least 24-months — or 36-months if you go with AT&amp;amp;T. The new plan will also likely control when and what device you can upgrade to next, which helps carriers and phone manufacturers better forecast the demand for devices and gives you that “free” upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pMgu7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nulRvV"&gt;For those iPhone 13 shoppers who are already happy with their carriers or existing data plans, or just want the latest unlocked device on a pre-paid plan, the carriers won’t extend as generous offers to you. If you’re already an existing customer, at minimum, you have to be willing to upgrade to the premium plans at Verizon, an unlimited plan at AT&amp;amp;T if you’re not already on one, or take a lesser trade-in offer at T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qopFGV"&gt;It is clear that carriers want to take back control over your upgrade cycle by offering scheduled upgrades and want to lock you into a bigger plan than you need by dangling an almost free phone. Sound familiar?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq5k6z"&gt;“The offers are more generous, but the big picture is that we’re seeing a shift from the EIP [Equipment Installment Plan] model to the subsidy model,” according to Wave7 Research’s principal analyst Jeffrey Moore. “To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago, when people routinely got an iPhone for $200, but paid higher monthly rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr8mjv"&gt;It also may seem like Apple is the one that is driving much of these promotions, as more iPhones sold is always beneficial for the company. But as much as Apple needs people to buy new iPhones every year, carriers need the sales even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkgz5V"&gt;According to Wave7 Research’s monthly surveys of retail wireless stores in the US, “more than 60% of smartphone activations at national carrier stores are of iPhones, with remaining activations being of Android devices, with Samsung having dominant Android share.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svV2PO"&gt;Carriers also have an extra incentive to nudge customers toward iPhones this year: the on-going global chip shortage has really affected the supply of Android phones, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676054/t-mobile-cfo-peter-osvaldik-samsung-supply-no-note"&gt;Samsung phones in particular&lt;/a&gt;. In Wave7 Research’s August 2021 survey of retail stores, it found the “supply of the base Galaxy 21 has been particularly weak for Verizon in the U.S., with multiple Samsung models out of stock online.” With a new round of iPhone 13s flooding retail stores, it’s not hard to see why carriers have an incentive to sell iPhones rather than Androids right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="y57ghv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chip shortages have made other phone models difficult to stock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxLTYe"&gt;It doesn’t hurt that service providers also need to shore up their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;5G user base&lt;/a&gt;, as they continue to expand the (fractured) 5G network in America. If iPhones are the lures that can hook customers to upgrade to an all-inclusive, multi-year data plan, then the carriers are in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTO7Sm"&gt;The truth is, Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629003/us-phone-upgrades-apple-samsung-market"&gt;holding onto their phones longer&lt;/a&gt; than they used to (remember the annual upgrade days?), with each generation of phone being more iterative than innovative. While that’s great news for our wallets and the environment, this trend does carriers no favors — they don’t exactly make the most money when we buy unlocked phones and order pre-paid plans or hang on to our phones for three years or more. Now that new iPhones are on the market, this is the time for carriers to once again capture some new customers with shiny iPhone 13s and fancy plans with built-in upgrade cycles — hook, line, and sinker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVINRa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, September 20, 2021, 12:20PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the new upgrade offers from AT&amp;amp;T were only available to customers who are willing to upgrade to the new unlimited plans. The AT&amp;amp;T deals are actually also available to existing customers with unlimited or grandfathered unlimited plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter wants to settle with angry investors for $809 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYdrNYLPJA5_7ZZwd-rBbcvZyBY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69883126/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has settled a class action suit for $809.5 million | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SB52Kl"&gt;Twitter said Monday it is proposing an $809.5 million settlement for a 2016 securities class action lawsuit that alleged the company misled investors about its user engagement figures. The complaint alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-announces-proposed-settlement-of-consolidated-class-action-lawsuit-301380355.html"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter said it expects to use cash on hand to pay the settlement amount likely in its fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0WzvZ"&gt;The lawsuit alleged that Twitter provided misleading information to investors about growth metrics to make the company appear financially healthier than it was. The complaint points to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/12/why-twitters-stock-soared-75-on-analyst-day.html"&gt;2014 event Twitter held&lt;/a&gt; with financial analysts where the company provided “unrealistic” growth projections that called for its monthly active users (MAU) “to double to over 550 million users and for revenue to grow by $4.6 billion by 2018.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET6h2t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864148/frankel_twittershareholderclassaction__complaint.pdf"&gt;The complaint alleges&lt;/a&gt; Twitter embarked on a “shell game” where it tried to conceal its user engagement from investors; as user engagement was considered a key driver of MAU growth. “[H]ad Defendants provided investors with complete and accurate information regarding user engagement, investors would have learned that Twitter’s MAU growth— and with it, the Company’s ability to increase revenue — had also stalled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ6VLy"&gt;Twitter stopped reporting its primary user engagement metric— timeline views— in 2014 according to the suit, a practice that made it harder for analysts and investors to track the company’s growth. Timeline views were tallied each time a user visited Twitter and refreshed their timeline to view more tweets, or to conduct a search. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-shares-fall-day-after-report-revives-questions-about-user-base-1438213551"&gt;Twitter said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that the metric had become irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSxYOj"&gt;Instead, it began including what the complaint called “low-quality growth” metrics, including sending automated messages to dormant users to encourage them to log in, so Twitter could include them as an “active” user. This practice was outlined by reporter Nick Bilton in a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/twitter-is-betting-everything-on-jack-dorsey"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article, where he said Twitter had done what many startups did when they needed to “goose” numbers: “they kind of faked it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWBM8"&gt;It also caught the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which asked Twitter in April 2015 —after the company made its annual securities filing— if it planned to provide “alternative metrics” to try to “explain trends in user engagement and advertising services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvmZev"&gt;According to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-DGB-43153"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time, Twitter told the SEC it had started to disclose how often users took an action in response to an ad, and how much its advertisers paid for that information. The SEC dropped its inquiry after this reply, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhPUXs"&gt;Under the terms of Monday’s proposed settlement, Twitter denies any wrongdoing or other improper action. The final agreement is subject to court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA4N6W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
