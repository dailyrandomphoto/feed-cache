    <title>Google says it’s got 400 games in the pipeline for Stadia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6SlH8NSAyZF8Ye-s7CPLjPbkedM=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67876854/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eyZPG8"&gt;Google has around 400 games on the way for its Stadia game streaming service, according to Jack Buser, the service’s director of games. Buser gave the figure in an &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/11/19/google-stadia-jack-buser-director-of-games-anniversary-interview/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;MobileSyrup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where he said that the company has “a roadmap of about 400 games in development from 200 developers” for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjJXDf"&gt;Buser stopped short of giving specific information on individual games but said that most would be arriving in 2021 and beyond. This list of Stadia games &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/10/stadia-game-list/"&gt;maintained by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, includes around 50 unreleased games that have been announced for the service, alongside another 100 or so that are already available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8S2l7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a very exciting many years ahead of us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ9exp"&gt;The director used the number of games on Stadia’s roadmap as evidence for Google’s long-term commitment to the platform. Buser said that Google’s planning for Stadia extends into 2023 at this point. “We are looking many years out into the future,” the director says. “Gaming is one of the biggest businesses at Google … Which is why you see us investing so much time and energy to support all these hundreds of developers building all these games. We have a very exciting year ahead of us. And, in fact, we have a very exciting many years ahead of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSET7A"&gt;These games in development include exclusive titles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931295/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-first-party-studios-jade-raymond-interview-exclusive-games"&gt;produced by Google’s own internal game studios&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323326/google-stadia-exclusive-game-deals-harmonix-rock-band-supermassive-until-dawn"&gt;partners like Harmonix&lt;/a&gt;. The company has made some big hires as part of its first-party development efforts, including ex-Ubisoft and EA producer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272996/google-stadia-studio-games-entertainment-exclusives-gdc-2019"&gt;Jade Raymond&lt;/a&gt; and ex-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164801/google-stadia-shannon-studstill-playa-vista-studio-sony-santa-monica-god-of-war"&gt;Sony Santa Monica studio head Shannon Studstill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tnzYD"&gt;“You’re going to see the amount of exclusive content on our platform scale pretty rapidly,” Buser says. He adds that some “cloud native” titles will be able to do things that aren’t possible on current systems because they’re “free from the limitations of a network appliance in your living room, like a PC or a game console.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMkvQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Red Dead Online will be a standalone game starting on December 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSRx5w4RtxpLy_R-eEFpRhjBpSw=/56x0:664x405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67875884/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOmDGW"&gt;The multiplayer portion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be a standalone game starting next month. Developer Rockstar Games &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61801/get-red-dead-online-as-a-standalone-game-on-december-1st"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the mode, called &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Online&lt;/em&gt;, will be available to purchase separately on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC starting on December 1st. (It’ll be playable on the next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X via backwards compatibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvF2Ze"&gt;To start, the game will be relatively cheap: Rockstar will be selling &lt;em&gt;RDO&lt;/em&gt; at an “introductory” price of $4.99. Starting on February 15th, 2021, that price tag will shoot up to $19.99. You may also need to clear out some hard drive space to fit the game, which will clock in at up to 123GB of space. It will also include the option to purchase the main story campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cF8a9s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most convincing open-world game ever made","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mDjIgs"&gt;The news shouldn’t be too surprising, as Rockstar followed a similar strategy with the massively popular online offering for &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; has been a huge success, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288378/grand-theft-auto-v-5-gta-ps5-2021-release"&gt;a standalone version is coming next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tweaked the News Feed to highlight more mainstream news sources for the election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KUdPu3nCCcZUP4dnWaTxkVABxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67871354/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x25Yo"&gt;Facebook, in the days after the US election, decided that an uptick in viral misinformation related to election results and President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede needed an extreme measure to be dealt with. So the company made a temporary change to its News Feed algorithm to favor mainstream news outlets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKHjhm"&gt;Facebook specifically tweaked how much weight the News Feed gives to “news ecosystem quality” scores, an internet metric designed to quantify the trustworthiness and quality of a news source. That way, users of Facebook would see more news from publishers like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, CNN, and NPR and less of the hyper-partisan pages that tend to peddle in inflammatory and sometimes downright false or misleading content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LKOBnP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook tweaked the News Feed to favor mainstream news publishers in the days after Election Day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwQFC"&gt;Many of those publishers with poor news ecosystem quality scores happen to be right-wing sites, and many of those right-wing sites have been spreading Trump’s false claims and countless other misleading and dubious election fraud and conspiracy theory stories far and wide on the social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHZjgS"&gt;The company had been signaling for months that it was preparing for worst-case scenarios like what eventually unfolded when President-elect Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election earlier this month, but Trump to this day continues to try to undermine and overturn the results. Facebook described these scenarios and its tools for combating them as “break glass” plans, according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPN0WS"&gt;One of those plans involved manually tweaking the News Feed. CEO Mark Zuckerberg ultimately authorized the change when presented with findings that right-wing news publishers were seeing huge swells in engagement from unverified stories about election fraud and how Democrats were trying to steal the election from Trump, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnDiXi"&gt;Facebook employees are now asking company leadership whether the changes could stay in place to help promote a healthier and less divisive news ecosystem on the social media network. But executives like News Feed chief John Hegeman tell &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;that there are no plans to implement any election-related tweaks as permanent changes to the platform. Rather, Facebook plans to study the experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aHmMp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat’s Spotlight is a big gamble for the company and creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_EjqJH4FAG9nSfPGWzruNmfEl2c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67870862/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIVQMa"&gt;Today, let’s talk about the deceptively bold way in which &lt;a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-spotlight-on-snapchat"&gt;Snapchat has reimagined TikTok as part of its new feature, Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;. A new milestone on TikTok helps to explain the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KT1RP1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PB84hb"&gt;Over the weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/22/21571189/charli-damelio-100-million-tiktok-followers"&gt;TikTok saw its first creator reach 100 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. The creator is Charli D’Amelio, who hit that mark just 18 months after she created her account. That speaks to the broad appeal of her personality and her videos, which often feature popular dances of the moment. The mark also reflects the rapid growth of TikTok, whose shortform videos are rapidly taking over all social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80L2SS"&gt;But in another way, D’Amelio’s achievement wasn’t remarkable at all. In fact, in many ways, it was textbook: a fast-growing new platform, a young and beautiful creator, and recommendation algorithms that drive more and more attention to the early winners over time. YouTube once had human editors choosing videos to go on its homepage; later, it added recommendation algorithms. Both contributed to the rise of early YouTube stars. Instagram often promoted new creators on its own Instagram account; later stars emerged through its recommendations-driven “explore” tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUZSAG"&gt;TikTok’s approach to promoting videos differs from its predecessors in notable ways. It opens to a feed of videos that have been chosen for you based on whatever the app has gleaned about you, whether you follow anyone or not. This following-optional model has meant that the app is as likely to make a star out of a dance or a snippet of audio as it is to make one out of a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0mVtS"&gt;That’s a primary reason why TikTok now feels like a vital engine of culture in a way that other social networks don’t. Instagram mostly knows how to promote influencers; TikTok, on the other hand, spreads dances, sounds, and jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qieswB"&gt;All of this has had a democratizing effect on the kinds of videos that go viral. The app’s For You feed is one of the most delightfully unpredictable spaces in social networks — even as it learns your preferences, TikTok still manages to surface truly strange and compelling new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qv1EOs"&gt;Yet, despite those differences, TikTok’s influencer economy looks much like any other platform’s. A handful of creators attract many millions of followers; those creators get sponsorship deals; and thus, the rewards to individual users follow a rich-get-richer distribution. Even &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/tiktok-creator-fund.html"&gt;TikTok’s plan to pay US creators $1 billion over the next three years&lt;/a&gt; seems designed more to retain top creators than to establish new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ceVnSs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc8rSD"&gt;What Snap is asking with Spotlight, the company’s own take on shortform video, is whether you can build an engine for culture that benefits many thousands of people, rather than hundreds. The company’s idea is to replace public follower counts, likes, and comments with something that more closely resembles a lottery — and at least through the end of this year, the company will pay out $1 million a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkvy7S"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/snap-to-pay-1-million-a-day-to-creators-for-spotlight-videos?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Sarah Frier explaining Spotlight in &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QSkInw"&gt;To earn the money, video submitters to Spotlight don’t have to have large followers — or even have public profiles. Instead, an algorithm will determine what to show Snapchat users based on how often others view the post. If others view the same video repeatedly, for instance, that’s a signal it’s catching on and will spur the algorithm to distribute it more widely. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vFFQZ"&gt;It’s unclear whether the random chance for a big payout will pull users’ great ideas away from TikTok and Instagram, but Snap provides a unique option: a video’s maker can choose to be private, offering a break from influencer culture. Snap has previously benefited by betting on a product that lowers pressure for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ja0cni"&gt;For TikTok to succeed over the long term, it has to retain D’Amelio and its other top creators even as their success continuously brings them new opportunities. For Snap to work, it only has to regularly convince average people to play the lottery in between messaging their friends. This bears close watching. Messaging is the stickiest user behavior that exists, and people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/15/health/psychology-playing-lottery-powerball/index.html"&gt;really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like lotteries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOqo3q"&gt;Snapchat has a lot of potential entrants in its daily talent show: 249 million daily users, the majority of which likely live in the countries in which Spotlight will initially be available: the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0rEJt"&gt;The app’s popular map feature has already shown that Snapchat’s community will contribute public posts to the network. Now, with Spotlight, they’ll have an ongoing (if fuzzy and possibly only theoretical) financial incentive to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Sqnm"&gt;Notably, that incentive is placed at the level of the content, rather than the creator. While some Spotlight posts bear the creator’s name, many really are anonymous — allowing people to profit from their posts without having to develop (and eventually become boxed in by) Snapchat-specific personas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKQ03Y"&gt;That’s not to say Snapchat couldn’t develop an influencer ecosystem that closely resembles its peers. In fact, the company keeps taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/11/03/snapchat-creators-public-follower-counts/"&gt;Snapchat began allowing its creators to publicly display their follower counts&lt;/a&gt;. Creators with large followings would seem to have an initial advantage in the daily lottery; it remains to be seen how many average citizens will win big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k01b31"&gt;I hope that many do. The real opportunity for Snap here isn’t that it incubates the next Charli D’Amelio in Spotlight — it’s that thousands of creators make real money on the platform, either once or a large handful of times, and we never learn their names at all. That would be something truly new in social networks — intermittent financial rewards just for using the platform as intended. And it would create a popular destination for Snapchat to show ads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edmBzE"&gt;Is it possible that daily rewards paid directly to creators could create a healthier network than our current marketplaces for attention? I don’t know — and when I chatted with folks at Snap last week, they admitted to not knowing themselves. But they very much felt that something like this was worth a shot, and so do I. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGgcWu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valorant Champions Tour is a global season-long esports competition for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wUoA8_2GxtUBGV11AY6nLV5vy_k=/151x0:1770x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67870577/Guiding_Light.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STlEZs"&gt;The professional &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; esports scene is about to get a lot more structured. Today, developer Riot Games announced its plans for competitive &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, and it includes a new global tournament series that will see teams play in regional competitions before making their way up to play the best in the world. Riot calls it the &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Champions Tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv7ZSm"&gt;While no specific competitions or dates have been announced yet, the competition is divided into three tiers. There are regional “challengers” events, and the best teams from these will move on to three different “masters” competitions, which will serve as the qualifying round for the final global championship event where 16 teams will compete. Riot says tournaments will take place in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzIRziO89nzfDddzmHPtmIwYm7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22071928/01_overview_vct_2021_structure_v1.1__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mb2cNp"&gt;The structure sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, also from Riot, which has professional leagues across various regions, and the top teams qualify for the prestigious World Championship at the end of the year. “We’ve spent a couple of years now talking to players, teams, fans, prospective partners, and other stakeholders, and we’re extremely excited to launch our first official season,” Riot’s senior director of esports Whalen Rozelle said in a statement. “Our focus will be on elevating and showcasing the creative and talented players who are shaping this game across the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkIvGl"&gt;Ever since its launch in June (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249936/valorant-esports-competitive-gaming-sentinels-rob-moore-interview"&gt;and even before&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21280796/valorant-riot-games-launch-overwatch-league-blizzard-esports-competitive-gaming"&gt;the potential for &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; as the next big competitive game has been clear&lt;/a&gt;. The game combines the tactical shooter elements of &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; and the colorful characters of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240497/overwatch-league-sinatraa-leaving-sf-shock-valorant"&gt;has managed to lure top players from both games&lt;/a&gt;. The esports scene has grown fairly slowly, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292718/valorant-ignition-tournament-series-esports-riot-games-date"&gt;starting with team-run events over the summer&lt;/a&gt;. The first Riot-managed event is slated to take place from December 3rd–8th, with the First Strike tournament, featuring eight teams competing for a pool of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Threaten your friends with outrageously priced, unappetizing Mandalorian cookies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgX_GZJySMypPuGQtW5XSQNgLvs=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67870547/EnX775yXcAABYdd.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIq2Ot"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579305/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-4-star-wars-prequels-controversial-the-force-baby-yoda"&gt;recent episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http:////disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/705878/9358?sharedid=verge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tiny puppet baby Yoda ate a blue cookie. I don’t watch &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, but I am online enough to have seen photos of the tiny puppet baby Yoda eating blue macarons. You can now buy these macarons, called “&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fm%2Fproducts%2Fnevarro-nummies-macarons%2F%23donotlink#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nevarro Nummies&lt;/a&gt;” from Williams Sonoma. Haha cool! I love macarons hell yeah. Except that they cost $49.95 for a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7vN5k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-mandalorian-macarons-cost-how-much-1845743554"&gt;&lt;em&gt;io9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;kindly did the math for me because I cannot add or divide, and it estimates them to be about $4.17 per cookie. To which I say, you’re out of your goddamn mind. You want 50 bucks for 12 cookies that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like prop food? Eyeball these Hostess rejects and tell me you don’t have concerns: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xg6pXUb7UcVRhXhc5injwpVhNic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22072020/img1c.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yNJsQ4"&gt;These cookies look like they’ve had their souls sucked out by a cartoon demon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p6OwSf"&gt;They look like they spent all summer vacation inside and returned to school pasty while everyone else got tan and hot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HgNGp1"&gt;They look like they’ve been sitting in your grandpa’s freezer for half of his natural life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jH7ODe"&gt;They look like they just gave blood and uh oh they better sit down they’re not feeling so good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="auxvbi"&gt;Sadly, this cookie has passed. It now wanders the Earth in search of vengeance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jYOzwv"&gt;They look like play food your unusually adept niece made with her remaining Play-Doh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2zqY2Z"&gt;These cookies? Just got devastating news about a high-interest loan they took out against their house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QPN0oL"&gt;Made y’all these cookies in pottery class but I forgot to add a glaze sorry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DcoyoN"&gt;These cookies fell below the counter at your local eatery and were served anyway by a teenager just trying to save up for a car. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf1f0B"&gt;Look, I can keep going, but I think you get my point, which is, gross. I have paid a lot of money for questionable food my life, like a $4 hot dog from a Times Square cart, but even this is too far for me. They probably taste fine, but I’m of the opinion that you and I — we deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhitJa"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, you can expect to find many of the best wireless earbuds on sale for their lowest prices yet. Apple’s AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus, and other popular models from Jabra, Sony, and more companies have never been more affordable. If you haven’t yet treated yourself to a set of truly wireless earbuds that connect via Bluetooth, prepare to never look back to using wired earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAI1eM"&gt;We have collected deals across multiple retailers below, and they’re all significantly lower than their usual asking price. As new deals become available or go out of stock, we’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oQibUb"&gt;Apple AirPod deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wgCXgH"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro, pictured above, are the star of Black Friday — and the best deal we’ve seen yet &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_ywp0i3SwExyOT35wUx0Mo38vUkExdm3-WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3Dywp0i3SwExyOT35wUx0Mo38vUkExdm3-WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will be launching online through Walmart&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, November 25th, at 7PM ET / 4PM PT. Their asking price is $250, though they’ve regularly sold for around $200. Walmart’s deal sees the price plummet to $169, though we expect it to sell out extremely fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zd8vKE"&gt;If you’d rather not deal with the hysteria or if you don’t want to shop from Walmart, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;amp;cjevent=bf1dd84529dc11eb814400030a24060c&amp;amp;utm_source=Vox+Media" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has the AirPods Pro selling at $190&lt;/a&gt;. This was nearly the best before word got around about the Walmart deal. But once that inevitably sells out, you should be able to find stock available at Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3CAOpg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVXoTR"&gt;For a simpler, less expensive set of AirPods that lack the Pro’s active noise cancellation and snug fit, the standard model is down to $119 (normally $159) at Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers. It includes a wired charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xJreM1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pTlrhv"&gt;If you want AirPods that include a case that charges wirelessly via a wireless charger, that model is $150 now (usually $199) at several retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HRZzTq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf4Sih"&gt;Apple itself isn’t honoring the big discounts on AirPods this holiday, but it will give you a $25 gift card and the option for free engraving &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21611428%2Fblack-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;if you buy some through its online store&lt;/a&gt; between November 27th and November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2uJAIZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday deals on Apple devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583192/apple-deals-black-friday-tech-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pPjtU5"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jsElvD"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Bud deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A photo of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live in someone’s ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bY3-AtgWgYwPxOs3OMRpHfd8MDg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699402/cwelch_200804_4129_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are $140 at several retailers, but the best deal is at Best Buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lf48yH"&gt;At Best Buy, you can save on either the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; ($110, usually $150) or the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724676918321004525" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; ($140, usually $170). These prices aren’t anything &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;special at this point, but these get a nod &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724676948121680191" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for including a $20 Best Buy gift card with either set of earphones&lt;/a&gt;. The only catch is that you need to buy your earbuds in the Best Buy-exclusive blue colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wh14e2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581901"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8oyIZz"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lRsLhO"&gt;Jabra deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4xWXx9"&gt;Jabra is offering a great deal on its previous-generation Elite 65t wireless earbuds. Normally around $100 (though, they’re commonly available for less), you can pick up a set at Best Buy or Amazon for $70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hd8ah5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625428"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sWSTjV"&gt;If you want features like noise cancellation, better sound quality, and a charging case that supports USB-C (unlike the Elite 65t’s Micro USB case), check out the Jabra Elite 75t, their successor. Normally $180, they’re down to $140.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmro1D"&gt;Best Buy says it will discount the Elite 75t further by $10 on Thursday, November 26th, so your final cost then will be $130 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KFWm4o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="YzBzXa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday laptop deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21591398/black-friday-laptop-deals-sale-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JDcp8N"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KugMUD"&gt;Other earbud deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E6ZcFW"&gt;The Sony WF-XB700 wireless earbuds usually cost $130, but they’re down to $68 at a few retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and more. These are a solid pick if you’re looking for a snug fit and better sound quality than you might expect for this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bzHUz4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591267"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv45ou"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 normally cost $100, but they’re $70 right now at Amazon and Best Buy. In our roundup of the best budget-friendly wireless earbuds, my colleague Chris Welch said these have better microphones for voice calls than any other model he tested in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q15sZo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr9QWi"&gt;The OnePlus Buds wireless earbuds cost $59 through the OnePlus site and from Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo. They usually cost $79. The OnePlus Buds Z usually get our recommendation since they are just $50, but for this deal, the standard Buds have larger drivers and a slightly more fashionable carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PAcLCz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9540296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4nzHC"&gt;Amazon’s debut wireless earbuds, the Echo Buds, are back down to their lowest price at Amazon. Normally $130, you can snag a set for $80. For this price, they’re a good value since they feature Bose noise reduction technology and can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21593991/amazon-alexa-echo-buds-workouts-fitness-tracking-wireless-headphones"&gt;now track your workouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bS5miI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on Google devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (left) and the Pixel 4A 5G (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hClBXgcBlG0u9XW3kuqR-6-ygs4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67870364/akrales_201012_4137_0027.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RZfnAz"&gt;Google’s line of products has expanded quite a bit over the years, and a bunch of them are discounted for Black Friday. You can find discounts on Nest smart speakers and smart displays, mesh Wi-Fi routers, Pixel phones, Stadia gaming setups, and smart thermostats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wMnsu"&gt;Most of the sales are available at a variety of retailers; we’ve linked the most popular ones for each below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjFQBI"&gt;If you’re looking for even more Black Friday deals, be sure to check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;continuously updated list of the best deals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XpY909"&gt;Google Pixel phone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="URmYc0"&gt;There aren’t a lot of sales on Google’s Pixel phones this year, but if you’ve been eying a Pixel 5 or a 4A 5G, there are a couple of ways to save a few bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LXFdCf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503881"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="P5fdy2"&gt;Pixel 5 activated on Verizon for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724677268407854801" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, $200 off its regular price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SmDi7j"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G for &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-4a-5g"&gt;$299 for new Google Fi customers&lt;/a&gt;, $200 off its regular price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="86Y00l"&gt;Nest Wifi mesh router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u6UDzJ"&gt;Google’s Nest Wifi system is a Wi-Fi 5 mesh router that’s good for internet speeds up to 500Mbps. It’s easy to set up and can cover up to 4,400 square feet with just two units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="izyUgQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YG4OW2"&gt;Nest smart display and smart speaker deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LWIleQ"&gt;The brand-new Nest Audio is available at a discount if you’re willing to buy two at a time, while the Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max are both aggressively discounted this year. If you need a bigger smart speaker, the Home Max is down to its lowest price ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kDkNl1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5ixVXy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="TexhPQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="3RQ8eU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625470"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
