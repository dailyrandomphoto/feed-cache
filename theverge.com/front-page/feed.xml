    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $249 now at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The blood oxygen animation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dqFRVtWs7Wj7FD9DSYpZHaRqxcU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204449/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXw07U"&gt;Best Buy &lt;s&gt;and Amazon are&lt;/s&gt; is offering the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739141156798835428#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $249&lt;/a&gt;, smashing yesterday’s discounted price of $299. This model normally sold for $399, and today’s price drop makes it more affordable than — and superior to — the Apple Watch SE that costs $279. The one downside to this promo is that it only loops in the Product Red model that’s all red, which might not go with your look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RDawh"&gt;At this price, it’s currently about $80 more than 38mm-sized Apple Watch Series 3, yet it provides a sizable boost in power and capabilities. For one, the Series 6 has more internal storage. A few other perks of this discounted watch include its always-on display that’s surprisingly efficient, and its ability to take blood oxygen readings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can see all of the differences here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNKVDl"&gt;This deal is lasting until later today, April 29th. A couple of &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers noticed that Best Buy has stock available for pick-up at their local stores, but it’s no longer available for shipping. Since publishing this story earlier, Amazon has sold out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm1PYD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MVmcSY"&gt;Other deals you should know about today include Woot’s one-day sale on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds. These keep dropping in price, and this deal is the best yet. If you use the Woot mobile app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woot/id571457538?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woot.android.main&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) to buy them and have Amazon Prime, you’ll get 10 percent off the order. So, instead of paying $170 (which matches the lowest price we’d seen up to this point), you’ll pay just $153 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV9OOv"&gt;If you don’t want to jump through those hoops, here’s the link to its site where you can get them for $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J4tBBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Meg0Kz"&gt;Daily Steals is offering an extra discount on standalone Google Wifi routers that can be &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9548099?hl=en" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;added onto either Google Wifi or Nest Wifi mesh Wi-Fi systems&lt;/a&gt;. With the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEWIFI&lt;/strong&gt;, you can get a new one for $68. The price over at Amazon fluctuates between $70 and $80. This purchase seems ideal if you want to add more coverage to eliminate Wi-Fi dropouts in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m9n1vW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Hiaw"&gt;Lastly, Daily Steals has yet another good deal if you want a new wireless gaming headset and don’t mind buying one that released a few years ago. Logitech’s G533 with DTS 7.1 virtual surround sound is just $55 by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELGTCH&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14116582/logitech-g533-wireless-gaming-headset-pc-price-ces-2017" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Former &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Vlad Savov spoke highly of its sound quality in 2017&lt;/a&gt; when they used to cost $150. These are rated to last up to 15 hours per charge and the battery is replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OR4BBH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MLdfM9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 29th, 11:44AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Amazon has sold through its stock of the discounted Apple Watch Series 6, so Best Buy is your only option left today if you want to get the $249 deal. Also, you may need to pick up your purchase, as we’ve noticed that home delivery isn’t available in some locations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NYPD is sending its controversial robot dog back to the pound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hc68wL59t4pwcNQZJLJbYFUDf6k=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69205101/robot_dog.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel | Video by Daniel Valls&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NggoCE"&gt;The New York Police Department has canceled its trial of a robot dog made by US firm Boston Dynamics after receiving fierce criticism regarding the “dystopian” technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuLiFN"&gt;“The contract has been terminated and the dog will be returned,” a spokesperson for the NYPD &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/28/nypds-robot-dog-will-be-returned-after-outrage/"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;John Miller, the department’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/nyregion/nypd-robot-dog-backlash.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the machine was “a casualty of politics, bad information and cheap sound bytes.” Said Miller: “People had figured out the catchphrases and the language to somehow make this evil.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUltMn"&gt;The NYPD began leasing the machine nicknamed Digidog last year. “This dog is going to save lives, protect people, and protect officers and that’s our goal,” said the NYPD’s Frank Digiacomo in an interview &lt;a href="https://abc7ny.com/exclusive-nypds-new-robot-dog/8669769/"&gt;with ABC7&lt;/a&gt;. The robot was deployed roughly half a dozen times during its tenure, mostly acting as a mobile camera in potentially hostile environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CcuUKE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The robot dog was deployed roughly half a dozen times, mostly as mobile surveillance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AB5BwH"&gt;“The NYPD has been using robots since the 1970s to save lives in hostage situations &amp;amp; hazmat incidents,” said the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1365083501989609477"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; in February. “This model of robot is being tested to evaluate its capabilities against other models in use by our emergency service unit and bomb squad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6z4wc"&gt;Many, though, saw the robot as a symbol of both wasteful police spending and increasingly aggressive tactics being deployed by law enforcement. “Now robotic surveillance ground drones are being deployed for testing on low-income communities of color with under-resourced schools,” tweeted NYC Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="htLtpk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Please ask yourself: when was the last time you saw next-generation, world class technology for education, healthcare, housing, etc consistently prioritized for underserved communities like this?&lt;/p&gt;— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1365023067769098245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bFitD1"&gt;In response to outcry over the machine, New York City Council Member Ben Kallos proposed a law that would ban the police from owning or operating weaponized robots. “I don’t think anyone was anticipating that they’d actually be used by the NYPD right now,” Kallos &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-york-lawmaker-wants-ban-police-armed-robots/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. ”I have no problem with using a robot to defuse a bomb, but it has to be the right use of a tool and the right type of circumstance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI85Wi"&gt;Kallos told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;this week that deploying Digidog on the streets of New York City highlighted the ongoing “militarization of the police.” Said Kallos: “At a time where we should be having more beat cops on the street, building relationships with residents, they’re actually headed in another direction in trying to replace them with robots.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MiQ0PH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Around 500 Spot units are in use, mainly in industrial settings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FlEYDW"&gt;Spot, as the machine is called by creators Boston Dynamics, has never been weaponized, and doing so would break the company’s terms of service. But it is being deployed in increasingly controversial situations. Although the company currently leases around 500 Spot units, with most of the robots being used in commercial and industrial settings, such machines are of increasing interest to both law enforcement and military users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oybyg"&gt;Earlier this month, it emerged that the French military has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;testing Spot in combat exercises&lt;/a&gt;. Boston Dynamics told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that while it knew the robot was being leased to the army, it was unaware it was being used in these exact scenarios. Spot was not weaponized in these exercises but used by soldiers for forward surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaqRGi"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Boston Dynamics said, “We support local communities reviewing the allocation of public funds, and believe Spot is a cost-effective tool comparable to historical robotic devices used by public safety to inspect hazardous environments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘It’s time’: Blue Origin teases ticket sales for its New Shepard rocket  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos Introduces The Blue Origin&amp;amp;nbsp;New Shepard&amp;amp;nbsp;System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBHl44RVaL_FawJEFeDi6iy2UGk=/0x0:4908x3272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204960/665033922.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tlKkr1"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is finally getting ready to sell tickets for seats on its suborbital New Shepard rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdhI71"&gt;No details on price or timelines yet, but the company tweeted a video on Thursday featuring a cowboy-hat-wearing Jeff Bezos driving an electric Rivian truck through the Texas desert right after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383407/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-launch-first-crewed-flight"&gt;Blue Origin’s 15th New Shepard test flight&lt;/a&gt; on April 14th. “Guys, how exciting is this, c’mon,” he said before stepping out to inspect the company’s crew capsule, which had just landed under parachutes (without a crew inside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="siEv6i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s time. You can buy the very first seat on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewShepard?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NewShepard&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up to learn how at &lt;a href="https://t.co/XNq9WALA7u"&gt;https://t.co/XNq9WALA7u&lt;/a&gt;. Details coming May 5th. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GradatimFerociter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GradatimFerociter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/K9jugCs9yz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K9jugCs9yz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1387763989917151234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYuYZo"&gt;Blue Origin’s tweet included a &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to an application on its website that urged visitors to “SIGN UP TO LEARN HOW YOU CAN BUY THE VERY FIRST SEAT ON NEW SHEPARD,” asking for a full name, email, and phone number. An announcement will come May 5th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FBXMo"&gt;The five-story-tall New Shepard rocket is designed to launch a crew capsule with seats for six roughly 340,000 feet into the sky toward the edge of space. Paying tourists can experience a few minutes of weightlessness in microgravity and witness super high-altitude views of Earth. After separating from the crew capsule midair, the rocket booster returns for a vertical landing, and minutes later the crew capsule also descends back to land under a set of parachutes for a soft touchdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwsxVu"&gt;New Shepard’s last uncrewed test flight was “a verification step for the vehicle and operations prior to flying astronauts,” Blue Origin said at the time, dropping subtle hints that its next flight might include astronauts. But very few details about the company’s commercial spaceflight plans — including cost and timing — are available to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Myspace Tom got it right</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_gX6qtQ449EYyOWLQojePGkEJw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204724/acastro_210426_4559_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YjVSXh"&gt;Two days after the DC insurrection, as the country was still processing the aftermath, MySpace co-founder Tom Anderson posted his second tweet of the past three years. Anderson attached the thinking emoji to an amateurish Photoshop render of Donald Trump, sitting in one of his typically garish offices, with his browser opened to Myspace. “‘MYSPACE TOM’ ABOUT TO GET A NEW FRIEND,” reads the caption, saliently predicting that with the entire internet industry mobilizing to hastily deplatform the president, Trump’s only access to the public might come from a long-zombified social media company. Anderson must’ve found the meme funny enough to log back on, disrupting a truly unprecedented offline streak for the average tech mogul. He disappeared again shortly afterward, withdrawing into the ocean of enviable vacation photos that have been left to fossilize on his few remaining social feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW9mPm"&gt;Anderson sold Myspace to News Corp in 2005 for $580 million. Six years later, Myspace sold again for a hugely depreciated $35 million, prompting Rupert Murdoch to refer to the initial purchase as &lt;a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/10/news-corps-murdoch-calls-myspace-a-huge-mistake.html"&gt;“A huge mistake.”&lt;/a&gt; In retrospect, it’s clear that Anderson cashed out at the perfect time. Myspace was quickly outpaced by other social media ventures — Twitter and Facebook — and by the early 2010s, the website had lost much of its user base and tangible identity. Visiting the URL today is downright surreal for any pilgrimaging millennials. All of its familiar trappings, (the Top 8, the chintzy color layouts, the twinkling custom cursors) have been scrubbed away. Instead, all you’ll find on the modern Myspace is a meager trickle of music news, aggregated directly from other corners of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E8QekC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/HHUJylI3J2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HHUJylI3J2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Anderson (@myspacetom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/myspacetom/status/1347723797361659906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3NX7PX"&gt;Industry analysts have long regarded the downfall of Myspace to be one of the greatest missed opportunities of the last decade, but frankly, I think it’s becoming increasingly clear that Anderson got off easy. It is true that Twitter and Facebook are more influential, and possess wealthier executives, than anything in Myspace Tom’s estate. If you are an entrepreneur in the psycho Silicon Valley tradition — that is to say, you are capable of perceiving a functional, quality-of-life difference between net worths of $100 million and $100 billion — then perhaps you too envy the lives of Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg. But just consider how those two weathered the events of January 6th: panicked, agitated, staring down at the chaos that they helped wrought, considering some truly arcane, dystopian-fiction solutions like perma-banning the president from their websites. What was Anderson doing while the great networks crashed and burned? Jumping back online for a quick dig, completely at peace that these questions are firmly Not His Problem Anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACpRc0"&gt;Go take a look at Anderson’s Instagram page. Like his Twitter, it is rarely updated and aggressively neutral. There are no bar charts, or product promos, or lengthy pontifications on how NFTs will “disrupt the investment economy.” Instead, Anderson uploads a steady stream of beautiful photos from all over the world. Here he is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BalBM3ehtdL/"&gt;on the crystal waters of the Maldives&lt;/a&gt;, standing on a dockside bungalow with an anonymous woman. Here he is a few weeks later in Bhutan, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BbgNgJsBtbL/"&gt;soaking in an alabaster monastery&lt;/a&gt; on a gorgeous November day. A few weeks later, he’s &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcBooWYhxqJ/"&gt;gazing at a sunbeam in Antelope Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcEDXPeBfgt/"&gt;skipping off to Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. For the longest time, Anderson’s Twitter bio read: “Enjoying being retired.” Today it simply says, “Enjoying the good life.” In fact, one of the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;tweets Anderson has made in recent years was a response to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JackDMurphy/status/1282699652954030082"&gt;a hugely viral post by user @JackDMurphy&lt;/a&gt;, who raved about Tom’s willingness to sink into the background without any fanfare. “What a man. Myspace was just too pure for this world,” wrote Murphy. (Anderson responded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/myspacetom/status/1282948450372349952"&gt;with two heart-face emojis and a salutary hang loose&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpTQr8"&gt;If there was any professional jealousy toward his peers — any latent bitterness that Myspace did not grow as dominant and ubiquitous as Facebook — it seems that it’s long passed from his mind. Anderson is instead focused on the tranquilizing impact of luxury. There is no hustle instinct left. He has nothing more to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W3KTFE"&gt;Compare that to the architects of Twitter, or Facebook, or literally any other social media enterprise with clout in the 2020s. The rent has come due. It’s now brutally apparent that the necrotic, parasocial tics encouraged by those platforms have an immeasurably negative impact on society. Facebook is plagued by constant scandals and may have played a role in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/11/601323233/6-facts-we-know-about-fake-news-in-the-2016-election"&gt;swinging the 2016 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter remains one of the worst places on the internet, to the point that it might be giving its most &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/how-twitter-fuels-anxiety/534021/"&gt;chronic users lifelong anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Even a benign arena like Pinterest — a website intended for moms who want to catalog different shades of wallpaper — is dealing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755406/pinterest-shareholders-lawsuit-sue-toxic-work-culture-discrimination"&gt;an uproar over its own internal toxic culture&lt;/a&gt;. Nowhere is safe. If you are a social media executive in 2021, a significant portion of your job must now be spent proving that your website isn’t actively destroying people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vxoknJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meanwhile, Dorsey and Zuckerberg are stuck in endless congressional hearings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T3fJPm"&gt;Myspace, on the other hand, peaked in 2005 — a time when the internet was both young enough and small enough to not cause any lasting damage to humanity. Sure, the platform ruined a handful of high school friendships and elevated “Hey There Delilah” to the top of the Billboard Hot 100, but then it immediately flamed out. That ought to be a lesson to every other major player in social media: institutional failure is the only escape. It’s impossible to save the world by editing a code of conduct over and over again. You can’t reform Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38RGEK"&gt;I think this image from Dorsey and Zuckerberg’s &lt;a href="https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/11-17-2020/t_6b001a6d61a34a9d8b06acccfac07ba6_name_t_2cb3fb29076b415995b2a1cf03aefb2e_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_01_23_Still014.jpg"&gt;most recent testimony to Congress&lt;/a&gt; sums up the divide. Dorsey is almost a year into cultivating his Rasputin beard, Zuckerberg dressed like G-Man from &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;, and each of them are locked in an interminable Zoom call where they’re frequently lectured by pedants like Ted Cruz &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ZzLYFWRCc"&gt;about the tyranny of Section 230&lt;/a&gt;. This is what happens when you’ve let social media grow beyond your grasp. These men are no longer tech ministers. Instead, they’re the vanguard of a brand-new class in America — these quasi-public bureaucrats, forever advocating on behalf of apps that, by all accounts, are slowly facilitating the annihilation of our political norms. Dorsey and Zuckerberg exist in a prison of their own making, and the Silicon Valley mandate of corporate overreach, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/facebook-spent-more-on-lobbying-than-any-other-big-tech-company-in-2020.html"&gt;Capitol Hill dealmaking&lt;/a&gt;, and endless, monolithic growth guarantees that neither of them will ever be able to take the Myspace way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWoDfs"&gt;Where do you think Anderson was during that hearing? Probably knocking back his third mai tai, on an island so exclusive that neither you nor I have ever heard of it. Never for a moment does he need to worry about the ways his former company might be fraying the civil order. Those days are over. Anderson is simply enjoying being rich and adamantly offline, knowing that — by luck or foresight — he abandoned the social media monopoly right as it was getting very, very dark. Let’s hope some other tech CEOs start taking a page out of his book. Please, for the love of god, just enjoy being retired.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mustang Mach-E is helping Ford find new customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BsAMTZeAmMUPKsth9cDKCsFgBTU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204672/sokane_210125_4386_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hOdz5W"&gt;Ford has sold more than 7,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs so far, and it says 70 percent of those buyers have never owned one of the company’s cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7ZI39"&gt;For comparison, Ford told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that 39 percent of people who bought the more affordable 2020 Escape were new to the brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twf6zX"&gt;So what does that 70 percent figure actually mean? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4YKpU"&gt;Well, if Ford keeps up the pace and meets its goal of selling 30,000 Mustang Mach-Es in the US in 2021, then it’s a promising sign the company is doing important work in attracting new customers. It’s also evidence that a really capable electric car can help Ford carve out new market share, and that some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;early production issues&lt;/a&gt; haven’t scared away unfamiliar buyers. That could be good news for the all-electric version of the bestselling passenger vehicle in America, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;the F-150 pickup truck&lt;/a&gt;, which Ford will formally reveal later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bFqH0"&gt;But there is a way this number could break bad for Ford. New customers are great, but if Ford sells fewer Mustang Mach-Es than it planned, a 70 percent mix could be evidence that current&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;customers really don’t like the electric SUV. That could throw more fuel on the fire of everyone’s favorite conversation about the Mustang Mach-E since it was announced, which is whether it “deserves” be called a Mustang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOMdbz"&gt;Ford certainly thinks it’s good news, as it was featured prominently in the company’s first quarter results, which &lt;a href="https://shareholder.ford.com/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Ford-1Q2021-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf"&gt;were published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “The strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital to [battery-electric vehicles],” Ford’s chief financial officer John Lawler said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5DHOxf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re going to be chasing demand for quite some time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uxc5G0"&gt;CEO Jim Farley took that a step further when talking about Ford’s new products, like the Mustang Mach-E and the Bronco. “Our fresh new lineup is not only fresh, but it seems to be hitting the mark of the zeitgeist of the customer right now,” he said. “I don’t know where that’s going to take us, but I do know it feels like we’re going to be chasing demand for quite some time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AneB7"&gt;But even the most optimistic take on the Mustang Mach-E’s performance is overshadowed by something else Ford shared Wednesday, which is that its overall output is taking a big hit thanks to the global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2MuA5"&gt;Ford said that its production will drop 50 percent in the second quarter of 2021 because of the shortage, a far worse dip than the 17 percent drop it already experienced in Q1, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;which even affected the F-150&lt;/a&gt;. The company said it expects things to recover in the second half of the year, but it will ultimately make 1.1 million fewer vehicles than it originally forecast. As a result, Ford said it now believes it will make about $2.5 billion less than expected this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc5nTu"&gt;Now, Ford’s not the only automaker taking a hit because of the shortage, and its output is &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Renesas-expects-bigger-damage-from-fire-at-its-chip-factory"&gt;also being affected by a fire at chip supplier Renesas&lt;/a&gt;. But some companies have adapted better than others as the problem persists. Tesla, for instance, shared strong first quarter sales results earlier this week and said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay"&gt;has largely been able to navigate the shortage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yfgeKj"&gt;Comcast said that &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;and WWE were to thank for its new-ish streaming service, Peacock, &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-1st-quarter-2021-results"&gt;adding 9 million signups&lt;/a&gt; during the first three months of 2021. Peacock now has 42 million members total in the United States. That looks strong compared to HBO’s 44.2 million US customers, but it comes with a huge caveat: Peacock has a free tier, and Comcast doesn’t say how many customers are paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXbrGg"&gt;Still, Peacock got a sizable boost during a quarter when other streaming services notched smaller growth. HBO added 2.7 million subscribers in the US, and Netflix added 4 million subscribers globally. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s parent company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXts7I"&gt;Two big names contributed to this quarter’s growth. &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;became a Peacock exclusive on January 1st, after leaving Netflix where it had become a staple of comfort viewing. And on March 18th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248330/wwe-network-peacock-move-announced-date-price"&gt;the WWE Network launched on Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, bringing over around a decade of pay-per-views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylMSpN"&gt;The problem will be whether Peacock can keep this up going forward. Those were two big names, and the service didn’t even have a particularly remarkable quarter — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;added 11 million signups&lt;/a&gt; last quarter, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345031/comcast-peacock-cable-second-quarter-earnings-customers"&gt;added 10 million signups&lt;/a&gt; before the service even fully launched. So 9 million, in comparison, during a quarter when it rolled out some huge names, starts to look a little concerning.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime is bringing its electric mopeds to New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGpjZzfBwTiuUGy9PIZpl7XodpI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204498/Moped_DC__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sja2Mg"&gt;Lime’s bright green electric mopeds are coming to New York City. The company that’s better known for its electric kick scooters will initially roll out 100 mopeds in Queens, Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ5KB6"&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;first launching them in Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;.  (The company is also operating a fleet in Paris.) Lime was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;recently approved to deploy 1,000 electric scooters in the Bronx&lt;/a&gt; as part of New York City’s inaugural shared scooter pilot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0GNR8D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3RiEN"&gt;The mopeds are manufactured by NIU, a Chinese company that also supplies mopeds to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;New York City-based mobility company Revel&lt;/a&gt;. NIU’s mopeds typically get between 25–100 miles of range. Lime’s mopeds will be speed limited to 28 mph and can be controlled and monitored via wireless connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVa7EZ"&gt;The mopeds are intended to lend credibility to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;Lime’s claims of being more than just another scooter company&lt;/a&gt;. The company sees itself as a “platform” for different types of low-speed, electric-powered mobility. Last year, Lime added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506805/lime-wheels-app-integrate-scooter-bike-mobility"&gt;pedal-less e-bikes from Wheels&lt;/a&gt; to its app in several cities as part of a new effort to integrate third-party micromobility providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tikmd"&gt;Mopeds are arguably a faster way to get around, but they can also be more dangerous, especially for novice riders. Lime says that riders will be required to take a multi-chapter rider safety course that is provided through the app, developed in partnership with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. Customers will be required to have a driver’s license in order to ride. And they’ll also have to take a selfie of themselves wearing one of the provided helmets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChO5Wf"&gt;The news comes a day after Revel, New York’s other moped operator, announced that it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405539/revel-ride-share-nyc-tesla-model-y-moped-uber"&gt;offering a Tesla-only ride-hailing service in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s library redesign makes it easier to find your downloaded content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYoONOZW_IqtNL3Xy0BjTMCHLqs=/0x0:8000x5333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204385/spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s redesigned Your Library features dynamic tabs and an easier way to sort your downloaded content. | Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ri8Wis"&gt;Spotify is trying again to make its Your Library tab easier to navigate. It’s &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-29/listeners-can-explore-their-spotify-collections-faster-and-easier-with-a-new-your-library"&gt;introducing&lt;/a&gt; dynamic filters, a new grid view, the ability to pin content, and different sorting options. The changes are coming to all users across iOS and Android over the coming week. The filters will likely be the most useful change, with users being able to filter between album, artist, playlist, or podcast. Premium users can also choose to view only downloaded content, which, up until now, has been hard to find within Spotify without scrolling through every artist and album they’ve saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K14lZA"&gt;Users can also choose to pin four playlists, albums, or podcast shows that’ll show up at the top of their content. To pin, swipe right on what you want to keep at the top. Finally, users can view content in a grid view or in a list by the content’s alphabetical order, recently played, or the creators’ names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrXRE1"&gt;The changes aren’t exactly monumental, but that downloaded content filter will likely be especially useful. I know I’ve spent way too long trying to find something I’ve saved whenever I fly, so hopefully this solves that issue. Spotify last updated Your Library &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-06-13/spotifys-your-library-refresh-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but only for Premium users. This forthcoming update will make the experience easier for everyone, which is much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft shakes up PC gaming by reducing Windows store cut to just 12 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJHMC2LiwaIdhtYqrumVnd9STdE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204323/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhzx1p"&gt;Microsoft is shaking up the world of PC gaming today with a big cut to the amount of revenue it takes from games on Windows. The software giant is reducing its cut from 30 percent to just 12 percent from August 1st, in a clear bid to compete with Steam and entice developers and studios to bring more PC games to its Microsoft Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ntGFw"&gt;“Game developers are at the heart of bringing great games to our players, and we want them to find success on our platforms,” says Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios at Microsoft. “A clear, no-strings-attached revenue share means developers can bring more games to more players and find greater commercial success from doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkPAYp"&gt;These changes will only affect PC games and not Xbox console games in Microsoft’s store. While Microsoft hasn’t explained why it’s not reducing the 30 percent it takes on Xbox game sales, it’s likely because the console business model is entirely different to PC. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo subsidize hardware to make consoles more affordable, and offer marketing deals in return for a 30 percent cut on software sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gY3UFk"&gt;Microsoft’s new reduction on the PC side is significant, and it matches the same revenue split that Epic Games offers PC game developers while also putting more pressure on Valve to reduce its Steam store cut. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120577/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition"&gt;Valve still takes a 30 percent cut on sales&lt;/a&gt; in its Steam store, which is reduced to 25 percent when sales hit $10 million, and then 20 percent for every sale after $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfON0iQZ2qBHzL-0kALhqJkq4-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477692/social_og.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam is still the dominate games store on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="551rFJ"&gt;Despite this larger revenue cut, Steam continues to dominate mind and market share among developers, but many don’t think the 30 percent fee is fair. A &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005374/en/Game-Developers-Conference%E2%80%99s-2021-State-of-the-Industry-Survey-Shows-Pandemic-Brought-Delays---But-Also-Growth-Reflects-Rising-Interest-in-the-PlayStation-5-and-Strong-Disapproval-of-30-Digital-Storefront-Revenue-Shares"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of 3,000 game industry professionals found that most game devs don’t think Steam earns its 30 percent revenue cut. Microsoft’s move will only increase the pressure on Valve further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MIp2U"&gt;Competing with Steam is still a big challenge. Microsoft and Epic Games have both struggled to convince game developers to list titles in their stores to compete with Steam. Epic Games has tried exclusives to lure developers in, but a big part of Microsoft’s struggles have been related to forcing game developers to use UWP in the past, and the terrible Windows store app that exists today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzFsTw"&gt;Microsoft finally started supporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;traditional win32 games in its store a couple of years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but this change alone hasn’t helped the Windows store compete with Steam. The 12 percent cut might tempt more developers into listing their games in Microsoft’s store, particularly if the company can improve the poor experience for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxMVLEeNGXQBtO2FuEh9C3xAt0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477694/096WaLI.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is promising Windows store improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HIcA5y"&gt;Booty is promising just that, with “improved install reliability and faster download speeds over the next few months.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;Microsoft is also reportedly working on an overhaul to its Windows store&lt;/a&gt; that could pave the way for developers to be able to submit any Windows application to the store — including browsers like Chrome or Firefox. These store improvements may even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps, which would be a big shift alongside this 12 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpCc9L"&gt;Beyond the store, Microsoft still needs to significantly improve PC gaming. The Xbox Game Bar has been a welcome improvement, but services like Steam and Discord are far more popular than Microsoft’s alternatives. The world’s biggest PC games are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;fighting a huge surge in cheaters and hackers&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows doesn’t do enough to help game studios protect their games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbKys4"&gt;“We know that we still have a lot of work to do, but based on the response from both PC gamers and PC game developers, we think that we’re headed in the right direction for this community with the investments we’re making,” says Booty. Microsoft still has more to share on its PC plans and general Windows improvements in the coming months. Booty teases a promising second half of 2021 “when our work across the entire PC ecosystem has the potential to come together in a way that propels the industry forward and brings great games to more gamers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite will support crossplay and cross-progression on Xbox and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cj2QdmolOxTy2Y4u8-4Kj4JABHs=/9x0:1805x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204336/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5NFrt"&gt;Microsoft is announcing today that &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e will support crossplay and cross-progression when it launches later this year. This will allow PC and Xbox players to match together and play the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign, and the support also extends to multiplayer. Any multiplayer customization and progress will sync across both PC and Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVJvT1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;will also be free to play&lt;/a&gt; when it launches later this year, with support for up to 120fps in the arena mode on Xbox Series X. Microsoft is also ensuring all of the customizations PC players expect are available inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite. &lt;/em&gt;This includes support for ultrawide monitors, triple keybinds, advanced graphics options, and other customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A21SnY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Halo Infinite: watch 8 minutes of gameplay on Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"},{"title":"Microsoft confirms Halo Infinite multiplayer will be free-to-play and up to 120fps ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"},{"title":"Halo Infinite is looking a lot better in these 4K screenshots ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302094/halo-infinite-4k-screenshots-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S5hkAV"&gt;We’re now waiting to hear more about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and when the beta will be available across PC and Xbox ahead of the game’s debut this fall. Developer 343 Industries is still working on improving the visuals in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;game was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following criticisms over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;gameplay demo last summer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; certainly looks a lot better in recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302094/halo-infinite-4k-screenshots-pc"&gt;4K PC screenshots released by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, but we haven’t seen any updated gameplay in almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nZVPJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e is a “spiritual reboot” of the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;making it easy for new players to immediately jump into the story. It includes an open-world environment that’s very similar to &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with the original Warthog vehicle and the Banished enemies. 343 Industries has also added new mechanics like Master Chief’s new grappling hook and a “Drop Wall” cover.&lt;/p&gt;
