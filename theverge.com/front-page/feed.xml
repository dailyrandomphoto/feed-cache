    <title>GeForce Now is about to start streaming PC games directly to LG’s TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DMCjOlT537JnRH18nfmts6fygU=/103x0:1498x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162769/LG_NVIDIA_GeForce_NOW_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A beta of GeForce Now is coming to some LG TVs running webOS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eA4eos"&gt;LG first said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224359/google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now-lg-tv-2021"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service was headed to some of its TVs, and now, it’s finally here — though as a beta. LG is rolling out the beta this week for “select 2021 LG 4K OLED, QNED Mini LED, and NanoCell TV models in 80 markets,” &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/11/lg-to-bring-nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-to-webos-smart-tvs/"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PSxW5"&gt;GeForce Now lets you play PC games you own on other devices via the cloud, and this new webOS app will make it easier to use the service on a bigger screen. That said, games will be capped at 60fps and 1080p resolution — you won’t be able to play GeForce Now games in 4K via the webOS app. (That feature is currently &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/21/shield-tv-geforce-now-4k-hdr-gaming/"&gt;exclusive to Nvidia’s Shield TV set-top box&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRbuaV"&gt;Every GeForce Now tier is supported, Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, including the new tier that lets you play games on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;its dedicated RTX 3080 pods&lt;/a&gt;. Every gamepad-supported game works, too, the company says. If you don’t own any PC games yourself but still want to give the service a spin, there are more than 35 free-to-play games available on GeForce Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kORakc"&gt;Nvidia says it plans to improve upon the current app by releasing updates in partnership with LG through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Target","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Amazon","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals on its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/earlyblackfriday"&gt;Early Black Friday deals event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $13 a month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you’ll pay either $6.49 or $6, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $257 or in white for $245. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13e6oH"&gt;If you’re looking for discounts on Apple’s high-end AirPods Max, the excellent noise-canceling headphones are currently on sale in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for just $479&lt;/a&gt;, a hefty $70 off. It may not be the all-time low as far as pricing goes, but it’s the closest you can get right now if you’re shopping early. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SnzpqH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Amazon is currently offering some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/4998f143?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=26&amp;amp;imprToken=c2be8a99-20b2-dfab-0c4&amp;amp;showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_8_4998f143_dt_sl5_f1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22541018%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;excellent savings on a variety of Shure microphones&lt;/a&gt;. These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is also offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u3IApI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $210 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $215 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="FfgzdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ejfdaH"&gt;Best Buy Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning the retailer will refund the price difference of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is also offering &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfZfEpiMWAR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day delivery is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you want to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nl3yNN"&gt;Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts on LG’s C1 OLED&lt;/a&gt; as Amazon, while adding a few other perks. These include 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats directly to your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rzBPD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sFXHWz"&gt;As expected, Best Buy is also offering the same discounts as Amazon on a range of other products. For example, the retail giant is currently selling various sizes of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Frame&lt;/a&gt; at the same discounted prices as Amazon. However, Best Buy is also including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is even offering free delivery, much like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4m6s"&gt;Moreover, Best Buy is currently selling &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, for $248 instead of $280. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="CO0Wc6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m_7721606980660150198sIzbeu"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03B6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy at an all-time low. Typically $249, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeHk1ZE7M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is currently selling the MagSafe-ready AirPods Pro for $220. Like the &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNzQ0Njg2L2FwcGxlLWFpcnBvZHMtdGhpcmQtZ2VuLXJldmlldw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Be70b5668" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 AirPods Pro come with a new charging case that &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTgvMjI3MzMxODMvYXBwbGUtbWFnc2FmZS1jaGFyZ2luZy1jYXNlLWFpcnBvZHMtcHJvLXFp/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03Bd83707a1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;works with Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging system&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in cheaper models, however, Best Buy is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeKJeBIMt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, selling them for $130 instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25573468.9424/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIxMzA5ODIwL2Jlc3Qtd2lyZWxlc3MtZWFyYnVkcw/60da2c65b2311314d2514a03C6ac3219c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our AirPods Pro review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUs7A8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $100 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $1,100 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AhcBZ8"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wijGQu"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OWSS8m"&gt;B&amp;amp;H launched its annual holiday sale, which includes early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, earlier this week, slashing prices on everything from cameras to Apple products. B&amp;amp;H also has an extended return policy for the holidays. Any purchases you make from the site from now through January 2, 2022, can be returned or exchanged through February 1, 2022. The retailer will continue to add new items to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fholiday-shopping%2Fdeals&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;”Holiday Head Start” page&lt;/a&gt; leading up to Black Friday, but you can also check out some of the most notable deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;First and foremost, if you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, B&amp;amp;H is selling the Wi-Fi version of the latest &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1636230-REG%2Fapple_mhnh3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_wifi.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 256GB of storage for its lowest price to date. Normally $1,199, the retailer is selling it for $1,099 for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/25603205.13772/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNDQyMDg0L2lwYWQtcHJvLTIwMjEtcmV2aWV3LWZlYXR1cmVzLXNjcmVlbi1taW5pLWxlZC1tMS1wcm9jZXNzb3I/60ca3952dba83e591470a57aB376c5282" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this model to be the nicest iPad available, even with its strange camera placement. The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3zmNuJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848332"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="L8hVRE"&gt;Dell Black Friday Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chwtCT"&gt;The home computer experts at Dell have started rolling out sales ahead of the shopping holiday, and while it naturally includes laptops, there are also plenty of deals to be had on desktops, headphones, and other accessories. Dell will likely have more to offer on Black Friday but has been releasing a steady drip of deals as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-12105225?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sneak peek&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be highlighting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiX1hd"&gt;Just about anything you buy on the Dell website comes with free shipping, though, delivery times can vary based on the product. If you’re pressed for time, however, Dell does offer a number of expedited shipping options in addition to a delivery estimate based on your ZIP code. If you’re not happy with your purchase, Dell has kept its standard return policy in place, which affords you 30 days upon receipt, with a potential 15 percent restocking fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Jv2SvB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptops to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eNqjUh"&gt;First off, the Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better. During its Black Friday sale, &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-12578053?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops-and-notebooks%2Fxps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fsmx13w11p2c3100p" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has marked down this configuration to $1,369&lt;/a&gt;, taking about $260 off the regular MSRP. While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="WjTQz6"&gt;Google Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lM9o24"&gt;Everyone’s favorite omnipotent Apple alternative, Google, recently started rolling out its savings ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from phones and smart speakers to comprehensive home security systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJykoB"&gt;For starters, a rare discount on the Google Pixel 5A has &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reduced the price of the phone to $400 at the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, knocking $50 off the regular price. While all eyes are on the new Pixel 6, we still stand by the Pixel 5A as a solid and affordable entry. Featuring one of the best cameras available in a midrange smartphone, the 5G-compatible 5A also comes equipped with 128GB of onboard storage, IP67 water resistance, and improved battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mSx6Mp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872706"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ek0Q9D"&gt;The Google Nest Hub is the best and biggest smart home assistant in the Google ecosystem. Currently, you can save $50 on this smart hub at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Charcoal%2F842552117%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $180. The display’s built-in camera allows you to make video calls, and the 10-inch screen allows you to access media from your favorite streaming services or cast just about anything from your phone. In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted that we were particularly impressed by this device's ability to display personalized content based on who is looking at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UwbkDP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872961"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xfNVil"&gt;This accessible Roku alternative from Google features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and the current sale at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has brought the Chromecast with Google TV down to $40, saving you $10 off the regular price. The streaming device features access to all of your favorite streaming services and has a built-in voice assistant to help you find your favorite shows. You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bsLjhK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kW1cnx"&gt;Some other noteworthy Google deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntkaYG"&gt;The battery-operated &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_doorbell_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nest Doorbell is down to just $130&lt;/a&gt;, taking $50 off the regular price at the Google Store. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TBbF8K"&gt;Samsung Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2nef2l"&gt;Samsung has kicked off its Black Friday discounts with some substantial savings on its Galaxy line of smartphones, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3. While you have the option to compound these savings by trading in an existing tablet or phone, these are the lowest prices we’ve seen for these devices outside those that require a trade-in or plan commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGJaTI"&gt;Right now, Samsung is currently offering $100 off the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1QBl83n22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version of the Galaxy Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; (regularly $1,000). Purchasing this foldable phone also nets you a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2 in the color your choice. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HCuv4y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6enBz"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1QzTIRUoj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 is on sale for just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; at Samsung, $100 off the list price. While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook. While free is generally a good thing, just note that the model on offer here isn’t exactly premium, as it comes with just 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oYwm9o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10388305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qLtKzl"&gt;The current deal on the 128GB Galaxy S21 will save you $100, bringing the price down to just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1Qzpg5cUw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$700 at Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only model currently on sale that doesn’t net you any extra goodies, but it’s a solid value regardless. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBjnYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeWmRN"&gt;Finally, we have the slick Galaxy Z Fold 3, which is on sale in the 256GB configuration with a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2 &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1QyWA3yMw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,550 at Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,800, Samsung’s current discount makes for one of the better deals we’ve seen on the luxury foldable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Regularly $200, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro are currently on sale for $150&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how much we loved their amazing sound quality and IPX7 water resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dNjozo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ25Z7"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are another great option if you’re looking for a pair of true wireless earbuds. Normally these shiny ear beans cost $170, but are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1L2koJ344" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for just $100&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their unconventional shape, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our reviewer Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt; liked their overall sound quality and marathon battery life, but thought the noise cancellation could use some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ul0VTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xgjs1u"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th and has been running similar deals every week since. The retail store also officially launched its weekly &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187778/2092?subId1=VergeEarlyBlackFridaySales111221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Holiday Best” deals&lt;/a&gt; on October 31st, which run every Sunday online and in-store. Target will also be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks that you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kGsRxP"&gt;Probably the best deal Target has going for it right now is its &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CcA5Vj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target is also currently selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $180. Released in 2017, these wireless, noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, support both Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;Apple’s discontinued &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/1141873/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFridayDeals111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; are on sale for $100 right now, $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold. Target’s current discount was supposed to expire on November 6th, however, it remains active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6bMV4g"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frazer-viper-8-khz-ambidextrous-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-8000-hz-polling-rate%2F-%2FA-82718043&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Target for $50&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ey6aVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhp-15-6-34-laptop-with-windows-home-in-s-mode-intel-core-i3-11th-gen-processor-8gb-ram-memory-256gb-ssd-storage-silver-15-dy2035tg%2F-%2FA-82457999&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode&lt;/a&gt; is on sale at Target for $430 instead of $540. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. Like the Beats Solo 3 deal, the discount was supposed to expire on November 7th, meaning its duration is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue superstore recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which began November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire soon. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;Below, we’ve collected a handful of deals that piqued our interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $79&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, the higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3y9ZWs"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt; through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MediaTek’s new Dimensity 9000 flagship could compete with Qualcomm’s top-tier Snapdragon chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4slEI1ao4vAnpgNt-xQBvC0A7xI=/121x0:1654x1022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162443/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.12.45_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="goAfye"&gt;MediaTek has just announced its latest flagship processor: the Dimensity 9000, the company’s most powerful chip ever that looks like it should be able to go head to head with the best chips that more popular competitors like Qualcomm and Samsung offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZACaL"&gt;Where previous top-tier Dimensity chips (like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/dimensity-1000-series"&gt;Dimensity 1000)&lt;/a&gt; were still less powerful than contemporaries like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 or Samsung’s Exynos 2100, the new Dimensity 9000 is coming out of the gate to make a case for 2022 Android flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hd9pC8mvi0gT5J0qduWPN2LjCsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025826/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_5.14.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7kU3pO"&gt;The new Dimensity 9000 is the first mobile chip to be built on TSMC’s 4nm process, in addition to using Arm’s new v9 architecture. It’s also the first announcement CPU to use Arm’s new core designs: a single Cortex-X2 performance core clocked at 3.05GHz, three Cortex-A710 cores at 2.85GHz, and four Cortex-A510 efficiency cores at 1.8GHz. The GPU, meanwhile, is a 10-core Arm Mali-G710, along with MediaTek’s fifth-generation APU with six total cores for AI processing (which the company says offers four times the performance and power efficiency compared to its previous generation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sldTPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first 4nm smartphone processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IHP3V"&gt;The new 18-bit Imagiq Gen 7 ISP claims to be the world’s first chip to be capable of capturing a 320-megapixel image (assuming your phone has a sensor that can shoot at that level), capable of transferring data at 9 gigapixels per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SL4KM"&gt;As one might expect for a modern smartphone chip, the Dimensity 9000 offers an onboard 5G modem with support for the 3GPP’s Release 16 specification. Notably, though, the new chip still lags behind competitors by only offering built-in sub-6GHz 5G support, without the faster mmWave standard. The Dimensity 9000 does claim to be the first smartphone to support Bluetooth 5.3 and will work with Wi-Fi 6E, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz0lq3"&gt;It’s likely that MediaTek won’t be alone for long when it comes to using the latest Arm technologies — Qualcomm, for example, is widely expected to announce a successor to its Snapdragon 888 chipset at its annual Snapdragon Tech Summit on November 30th. But even if MediaTek finds that the Dimensity 9000 is merely in the same weight class as whatever Qualcomm announces this year, instead of a leap ahead, that’s a big win for MediaTek, which has largely lagged behind until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSRCZ1"&gt;MediaTek has long been an also-ran when it comes to major Android devices, but the Dimensity 9000 shows that it’s finally looking to really compete. The question now is whether phone manufacturers are ready to join it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several states are investigating how Instagram keeps kids on the platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeuhB6SdVzggpl5WxjvnpzMWePQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162302/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPIhun"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-co-leads-nationwide-investigation-into-instagrams-impact-on-young-people"&gt;group of state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ago.nebraska.gov/news/ag-peterson-joins-nationwide-investigation-instagram%E2%80%99s-impact-young-people"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; an investigation into “the techniques utilized by Meta to increase the frequency and duration of engagement” of children and teens on Instagram and the negative effects that may cause (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-effects-on-children-is-being-investigated-by-coalition-of-states-11637262000"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The group, which includes officials from California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Vermont, accuses the company of doing this despite reports that its own research showed its platform could have a negative effect on young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VmnOr"&gt;The research in question was exposed in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;a report from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the company’s own documents show “Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls.” It was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;discussed in a Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt;, where Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said that the company is unlikely to change its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;habit of putting profits above people’s well-being&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation will be looking into whether the company broke consumer protection laws in its quest to keep people engaging with content on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1wf2ib"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s whistleblower report confirms what researchers have known for years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="m1AnHU"&gt;This group of attorneys general isn’t the only one taking action against Meta — Ohio’s attorney general is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785206/ohio-suing-facebook-instagram-meta-misled-investors-children"&gt;suing the company separately&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the company of misleading the public about its products’ effects on children. Meta said the suit was “without merit” and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;largely pushed back against the reports&lt;/a&gt; from outlets like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, saying that the research published lacked context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usv4Ak"&gt;Some of the attorneys general involved in the investigation announced on Thursday were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428710/facebook-instagram-children-under-13-attorney-general-letter-data-collection-coppa"&gt;involved in an effort earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; to convince Meta — then Facebook — to stop working on an Instagram for kids. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;previously announced its goal&lt;/a&gt; of making a version of the social network for people younger than 13 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;would later say&lt;/a&gt; it was “pausing” work on it. Senate and House lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;have called the pause&lt;/a&gt; “insufficient,” arguing that the company had “completely forfeited the benefit of the doubt when it comes to protecting young people online, and it must completely abandon” the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LgzxRs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meta is concerned about young people not using its products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7waulI"&gt;The company has made it clear that it wants to focus on the younger generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;amid internal concerns&lt;/a&gt; that it’s struggling to attract and keep the attention of teens and 20-somethings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg himself said&lt;/a&gt; in October that he wanted “serving young adults” to be some teams’ “north star.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv7iuw"&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigative effort with Nebraska’s AG, said in a press release that Meta “failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health — exploiting children in the interest of profit.” She vowed that the coalition would “get to the bottom of this company’s engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lNzQD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 18th, 6:53PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original version of this post misstated that the Ohio attorney general was suing the state. The suit is actually against Meta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="F7ttME"&gt;ExxonMobil’s &lt;a href="https://www.energyintel.com/0000017d-2f96-defa-ab7d-6fbf0ac90000"&gt;spending spree&lt;/a&gt; during yesterday’s lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico was significant, experts say, because the company might use the area for something other than oil and gas extraction. Experts outside the company speculate that ExxonMobil wants to use Gulf waters for a novel purpose: sequestering captured carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEgMko"&gt;The Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gulf-mexico-lease-sale-results-announced"&gt;auctioned off&lt;/a&gt; vast tracts of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas companies yesterday in one of the &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2021/11/17/massive-gulf-of-mexico-oil-lease-sale-draws-192-million-283335"&gt;largest federal lease sales in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. The sale drew sharp criticism from environmental groups, which say that allowing new oil and gas development is incompatible with America meeting its climate goals. But it’s possible that Exxon — the biggest bidder in yesterday’s sale — isn’t planning on extracting new fossil fuels at all. The company surprised analysts by bidding on almost 100 leases in shallow waters close to shore where fossil fuel reserves are pretty depleted. That likely means that Exxon plans to repurpose old oil and gas wells for carbon storage, or find new places in the area to pump captured CO2 underground, experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kuekRi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s just not enough oil to make the bang for the buck worth it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0Gdfx"&gt;“There’s just not enough oil to make the bang for the buck worth it for them,” says Brian Snyder, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkTEMa"&gt;William Turner, a lead analyst at energy research firm Rystad Energy, agreed, calling the lease areas “the equivalent of [Exxon] buying up a kind of mom and pop operation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2GZzN"&gt;“This has to be for something other than oil and gas exploration,” Turner says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="649TEk"&gt;ExxonMobil has yet to confirm or deny the speculation. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for the company said Exxon would “evaluate the seismic and subsurface geology for future commercial potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wrDKj"&gt;If experts’ hunches are right, this would likely mark the first time that the government has leased federal waters for carbon sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dUI712"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This would likely mark the first time that the government has leased federal waters for carbon sequestration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QdEdtv"&gt;Fossil fuel companies have sold carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as a way to minimize the harm they do to the planet. The strategy entails using new technologies to scrub planet-heating CO2 out of smokestack emissions. The captured carbon dioxide then needs to be transported via pipelines to places where it can be stored underground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGALPE"&gt;The Gulf of Mexico’s seafloor could become a hotspot for carbon sequestration because of its proximity to a lot of heavy industry and existing oil and gas infrastructure. Experts have suggested captured CO2 might be pumped into old oil and gas fields in the Gulf or injected &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015WR017609"&gt;into saline aquifers&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7krvc"&gt;ExxonMobil has &lt;a href="https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/reducing-emissions/carbon-capture-and-storage/putting-houstons-carbon-capture-and-storage-potential-into-perspective/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; CCS part of its “ongoing efforts to reduce emissions.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This year, the company announced plans to turn the &lt;a href="https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/reducing-emissions/carbon-capture-and-storage/putting-houstons-carbon-capture-and-storage-potential-into-perspective/"&gt;Houston Ship Channel&lt;/a&gt; into a sort of hub for CCS. The channel connects Houston to the Gulf of Mexico and is lined with petrochemical plants and other heavy industries. The plan could entail pairing those plants with CO2 scrubbers, and then piping the captured carbon dioxide out to the Gulf. By 2040, the hub could capture up to 100 million metric tons of CO2 a year, Exxon says. Such an effort would require a joint investment from industry and government, according to ExxonMobil — to the tune of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-technology-business-paris-f76df7ee4e6a8a4b6bab96badb2eb41a"&gt;$100 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRHuZH"&gt;High costs like this have historically been a prohibiting factor with carbon capture projects; they’re what &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-only-carbon-capture-plant-in-the-u-s-just-closed-1846177778"&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt; the only coal plant outfitted with CCS in the US. But some new funding could become available through the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Joe Biden signed into law this week, which includes billions of dollars of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;investments in carbon capture and removal technologies and pipelines&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on so-called ‘hard-to-decarbonize’ industries like cement and fertilizer production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XLsvN"&gt;Many people are, unsurprisingly, wary of fossil fuel companies’ claims about CCS. Environmentalists and progressive lawmakers have called CCS a “false solution” for climate change, saying that it could derail a transition to renewable energy and keep the economy dependent on oil and gas. Scientists agree that greenhouse gas emissions need to &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;essentially disappear by the middle of the century&lt;/a&gt; in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, and that can only be achieved by weaning economies off fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qoAH2Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This industry has seen the Gulf as its own personal sewer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w7Ne2c"&gt;“This industry has seen the Gulf as its own personal sewer for a long time, so the idea that they would turn to the Gulf for this project is unsurprising,” says Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law. “It’s also unacceptable because the risks of carbon capture and storage are significant,” he says. He’s worried about how construction and potential ruptures of new CO2 pipelines might affect Gulf Coast communities. High concentrations of carbon dioxide, if it leaks out of pipelines or storage wells, can be an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642806/co2-pipeline-explosion-satartia-mississippi-carbon-capture"&gt;asphyxiant&lt;/a&gt; to people and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fcqxey"&gt;Another concern with CCS is that it has traditionally been used by the oil and gas industry for what’s called “enhanced oil recovery” (EOR). Basically, fossil fuel companies shoot the captured CO2 underground to push out hard-to-reach oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ye8X49"&gt;“That would be my concern, that Exxon is actually doing this not just for storage, but for EOR,” Snyder says. “My guess is they’re actually doing a little of both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5YuFt"&gt;The Biden administration has already faced a lot of criticism for selling federal water leases to oil and gas companies just days after calling on all nations to slash greenhouse gas emissions during a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22778646/glasgow-global-climate-summit-cop26-adaptation-finance-loss-damage"&gt;United Nations climate summit&lt;/a&gt; in Glasgow. The lease sale was set in motion by the Trump administration, and a Trump-appointed federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-climate-gulf-oil-lease-sale_n_618eeb77e4b0b1aee9252872"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; an executive order by Biden earlier this year to suspend new oil and gas leases. Still, environmentalists argue that Biden could have done more to stop yesterday’s sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WUBIV"&gt;But while the Biden administration might not have wanted to hold the lease sale, if ExxonMobil is in fact planning to store captured CO2 in the Gulf, that could change the administration’s calculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFMQfl"&gt;“You could hypothesize with this, that maybe this gets the attention of the administration to say ‘Okay, maybe we need to rethink completely shutting down new leasing,’” Turner says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford and GM are getting into chip development to help deal with the shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVu_JcHnv0gpmlVrlYWqh7NAB4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162223/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vMbtLf"&gt;A year into the computer chip shortage that’s heavily affecting vehicle production, Ford announced a collaboration with chipmaker GlobalFoundries Inc., as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-enters-semiconductor-business-amid-chip-shortage-impact-11637242202?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9xEP7"&gt;Ford’s &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/18/globalfoundries-ford-auto-chip-supply.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; about the non-binding agreement is light on specifics but mentions plans “to advance semiconductor manufacturing and technology development within the United States.” Without committing to building any plants, the two companies say they will “explore expanded semiconductor manufacturing opportunities to support the automotive industry.” Speaking during an event later in the day, GM CEO Mark Reuss &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/gm-will-co-develop-chips-with-several-producers-to-secure-supply?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;said his company is working to co-develop new chips&lt;/a&gt; with many semiconductor partners like Qualcomm, TSMC, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS4TaF"&gt;Ford’s VP of vehicle embedded software and controls, Chuck Gray, told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that “[we] feel like we can really boost our product performance and our tech independence at the same time.” GlobalFoundries spun off from AMD in 2009, eventually becoming the world’s fourth-largest semiconductor manufacturer, behind TSMC, Samsung, and UMC, &lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210831-10914.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TrendForce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It manufactures chips for other companies like AMD, Qualcomm, and even Samsung. The company went public last month, and its CEO said at the time that its chip supply &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/30/globalfoundries-ceo-were-sold-out-of-semiconductor-chip-capacity-through-2023.html"&gt;is sold out through 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LGt8ah"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s about time for us to catch up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ak2QYL"&gt;The car industry’s demand for chips has risen in recent years to accommodate new technology in vehicles. However, many rely on older, cheaper technology and make smaller orders than a company like Apple or Nvidia. Throw in pandemic-related supply chain issues and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/renesas-aims-to-resume-full-production-at-fire-hit-plant-in-may"&gt;a fire at a key plant&lt;/a&gt;, and you have a situation that could last for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sqz4Bv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OTxKGq"&gt;After announcing the electric F-150 in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"&gt;Ford CEO Jim Farley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that its plan to address the chip shortage involved going direct, and now we’re seeing what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="25GmDM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a big push from a number of chip makers and foundries to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do the manufacturing in the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, to get various incentives from the administration to support that investment. All of that still looks like 10 years out. How do you solve the chip shortage today? Do you just wait it out, or are there steps you can take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fama0h"&gt;Well, there’s certainly things we can do. For single-source content, like the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/renesas-aims-to-resume-full-production-at-fire-hit-plant-in-may"&gt;Renesas Naka facility that had a fire&lt;/a&gt;, those single-sourced chips, we can run some buffer stocks. Which is not ideal. It’s kind of a waste, but it’s better than running out of what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D4w9P"&gt;The other thing we can do is to give the foundries more confidence in future production by going direct with them. So on behalf of our supply base, actually going and contracting purchases. I think boots on the ground in places like Taiwan and China and Asia are going to be more important for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEJ4ax"&gt;I think there’s certainly things we can do to make it better. We are starting to see some confidence in the second half of this year, but when I talk to my colleagues at Cisco, and Dell, and other companies, they run the supply chain totally different than automotive. And it’s about time for us to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wGYT5w"&gt;He also mentioned that the plans to help build company autonomy mean bringing in “real expertise on silicon and chip design.” Having software and chip design knowledge in-house is helpful if you’re like Tesla and decide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrite your vehicle software to work on the chips that are available&lt;/a&gt;. In today’s announcement, Farley says, “This agreement is just the beginning and a key part of our plan to vertically integrate key technologies and capabilities that will differentiate Ford far into the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsTWPP"&gt;In February, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;F-150 was hit hard&lt;/a&gt; by the global chip shortage as it reportedly cut production of Ford’s most popular vehicle in half. Several of Ford’s North American plants shut down at times this year as a result of the shortages. The effects have been felt across the industry similarly, with plant shutdowns and the removal of features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787339/chevrolet-trucks-heated-seats-2022-models-chip-shortage-supply-chain-issues"&gt;heated seats in Chevy trucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;touchscreens in BMWs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;USB ports in some Teslas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tests giving more control of News Feed content to users again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3w85LD2qXZ9T50PgnOGyO-gY1M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162060/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is switching up the News Feed again | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r65vn8"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta said it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-more-control-for-brands-and-people-in-feed"&gt;is testing new ways&lt;/a&gt; for users to customize the content they see in their News Feeds. The company said in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-more-control-for-brands-and-people-in-feed"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post Thursday that the test, available to a “small percentage” of users to start, would allow people to adjust their preferences to increase or reduce the amount of content they see from specific friends, family, groups, and pages they’re connected with on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRwSDZ"&gt;Facebook has tweaked the way the News Feed presents content numerous times in the past several years and seems to keep rethinking what content should be prioritized and why. In 2015, it said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/21/8463051/facebook-algorithm-changes-publishers-newsfeed"&gt;changing News Feeds&lt;/a&gt; to favor content from close friends over that from brands and publishers. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/29/12055124/facebook-news-feed-algorithm-changes"&gt;2016, Facebook said again&lt;/a&gt; it would adjust its algorithm so posts from friends would get priority over publishers. Then in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions"&gt;2018, the company said it was changing the News Feed&lt;/a&gt; so posts that might spark “back and forth discussion” (aka engagement, which is Facebook’s bread-and-butter) would be more likely to appear than more passive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSds8g"&gt;Guess what Facebook did in 2020? Well, a few things, but also it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612728/facebook-news-feed-us-election-change-mainstream-news-misinformation"&gt;tweaked the News Feed yet again&lt;/a&gt;, this time to favor more trustworthy and quality news sources. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180259/facebook-news-feed-change-post-election-publishers-misinformation"&gt;rolled back that “nicer” version&lt;/a&gt; of the News Feed in December 2020 to the reported chagrin of some Facebook employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsJ6ZD"&gt;How the social media giant controls its News Feed has largely been a mystery, but Facebook &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-ranking/types-of-content-we-demote/"&gt;released a report in September&lt;/a&gt; it said would give the public some insights into how it decides what content it suppresses, or “demotes” — like clickbait and posts from those who repeatedly violate its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VHUa9W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meta goes into lockdown","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785397/meta-facebook-leak-lockdown"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1hH2JX"&gt;But now users in the new test will be able to turn down the volume on friends, family, pages, and groups in their News Feeds if they prefer. Meta said in the blog post that this was “part of our ongoing work to give people more control over News Feed, so they see more of what they want and less of what they don’t.” Sounds great! Again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGPGfu"&gt;Facebook is also going to make changes to news controls for its business customers, expanding the “topic exclusion” controls to a test group of advertisers that run ads in English. The advertisers can select from three topic groups — news and politics, social issues, and crime and tragedy— so that they can prevent their ads from appearing near posts about those topics if they prefer. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="cnwmiN"&gt;Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;a bombshell &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick allegedly knew, withheld, and even participated in harassment and abusive behavior, the company’s big console partners Sony and Microsoft are semi-privately expressing their distress. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/xbox-chief-says-he-s-evaluating-relationship-with-activision?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft boss Phil Spencer has now told staff he was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision Blizzard and that Microsoft is “evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard and making ongoing proactive adjustments” as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hToAgA"&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report is accurate,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Microsoft also shared a generic, completely unrelated statement about how Microsoft wants a “welcoming and inclusive environment for all of our employees at Xbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HFV3l"&gt;Yesterday, Sony PlayStation boss Jim Ryan similarly told employees that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;the company had expressed “deep concern” with Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, adding that “[we] do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AliP1c"&gt;These private statements from Sony and Microsoft obviously don’t carry anywhere near the same weight as if these companies &lt;em&gt;publicly&lt;/em&gt; called out the situation at Activision Blizzard, and it’s not clear if either company is interested in taking any concrete actions yet. Activision Blizzard is one of the most powerful publishers in the video game industry, and both console makers rely on them to provide new big-budget games for their consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhf8mN"&gt;That said, Microsoft and Sony also want to be seen as committed to a less toxic video game industry, and Phil Spencer, in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612620/phil-spencer-console-wars-tribalism-xbox-playstation-ps5-sony-microsoft"&gt;has made combating toxicity&lt;/a&gt; part of his public brand. “This type of behavior has no place in our industry,” reads part of Spencer’s new memo about Activision Blizzard, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="z72bqh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Over 500 Activision Blizzard employees petition to remove CEO Bobby Kotick","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"},{"title":"Activision Blizzard’s rot goes all the way to the CEO, alleges bombshell report","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gv9dy3"&gt;“We respect all feedback from our valued partners and are engaging with them further,” Activision Blizzard said in a statement. “We have detailed important changes we have implemented in recent weeks, and we will continue to do so. We are committed to the work of ensuring our culture and workplace are safe, diverse, and inclusive. We know it will take time, but we will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOoaPC"&gt;While over 1,000 Activision Blizzard employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;have signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove CEO Bobby Kotick from the company, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787484/activision-blizzard-shareholders-demand-ceo-bobby-kotick-resignation"&gt;some shareholders have demanded his resignation&lt;/a&gt;, the board of directors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;has so far signaled&lt;/a&gt; they’re confident in his leadership. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available today for Walmart Plus subscribers (update: sold out)</title>

  &lt;p id="1SWZhK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 18th, 3:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart has sold out of both PlayStation 5 consoles and the Xbox Series X. We’ll be sure to keep you updated when we hear of another round of free or paywalled restocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2X3Md"&gt;Console restocks are getting more and more frequent these days — particularly as the Black Friday season heats up and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals continue to roll out&lt;/a&gt; — but retailers have been quick to cull the herd of potential customers by putting some stock behind paid subscription services. Walmart has a next-gen console restock happening today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, though, it’s exclusive to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart Plus paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. You can queue up to purchase a disc-based &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; for $500, a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; for $400, or an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; console for $500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dy2drl"&gt;Be sure to log into your Walmart Plus account ahead of time, and it’s always a good practice to save your billing and shipping in your account ahead of time. Note that &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll need to be a paid subscriber to Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to buy any of these three consoles, as a free trial account will not be accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzNxrV"&gt;A Walmart Plus subscription costs $13 per month or $98 per year and promises early and special access to deals — such as console restocks like this one and a four-hour early window on Black Friday deals. It also includes free shipping options akin to competitors like Amazon Prime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government seizes $56 million in crypto from BitConnect’s ‘number one promoter’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q5YLZmM_7qt08JIU4Ahc_WYLBE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70161152/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DrIyot"&gt;The US government &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/56-million-seized-cryptocurrency-being-sold-first-step-compensate-victims-bitconnect-fraud"&gt;has seized $56 million worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; from an admitted participant in the BitConnect scam and intends to sell the coins and use the proceeds to reimburse victims. The Department of Justice says that it’s the largest recovery of cryptocurrency to date — and that it was willingly given up by Los Angeles resident Glenn Arcaro, who has called himself BitConnect’s “number one promoter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8271A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-172"&gt;According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&lt;/a&gt;, BitConnect convinced people to invest a total of $2 billion by telling them that it had a bot capable of generating incredibly high rates of return from crypto trading. In other words, BitConnect sold itself as a way for people to easily invest in cryptocurrency and to make a lot of money doing so, at a time when people were hearing a lot about crypto but didn’t know much about it (around 2016 through 2018). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PN6nfG"&gt;In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/director-and-promoter-bitconnect-pleads-guilty-global-2-billion-cryptocurrency-scheme"&gt;the DOJ says it was all a scam&lt;/a&gt; — BitConnect used money from new investors to pay old ones (otherwise known as a Ponzi scheme), and its advocates built pyramid schemes where they would get a cut for convincing others to invest by promising them the same deal. In September, Arcaro pleaded guilty to participating in both parts of the scam while allegedly posting videos online to make fun of BitConnect doubters. He said that he had earned what was then valued at $24 million by his participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BoZLi3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCcwn6bGUtU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EF6m5k"&gt;Some may also remember BitConnect from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCcwn6bGUtU"&gt;a heavily memed presentation&lt;/a&gt; given by one of its investors, who repeatedly shouted “BitConneeeeeect” and said that his wife accused him of falling for a scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glDuls"&gt;While BitConnect &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-172.pdf"&gt;largely traded in Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; (victims would buy BitConnect’s own BCC tokens using Bitcoin and could ostensibly convert BCC back into Bitcoin through a convoluted process), the government plans to reimburse victims in USD. The DOJ’s press release says that the law enforcement arm of the US Postal Service will be helping convert the crypto to fiat currency. The government &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/us-v-glenn-arcaro-21cr02542-twr"&gt;has set up a website for victims&lt;/a&gt; who are looking for compensation after the court sentences Arcaro in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
