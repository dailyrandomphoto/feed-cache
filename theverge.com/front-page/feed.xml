    <title>Sony shows off a robot grabber, 4K OLED panels for VR, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e1vTG29mrjApDs9sRdAlIUPqqEA=/0x0:2391x1594/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70246409/Screen_Shot_2021_12_08_at_11.09.19.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="asltNV"&gt;Sony’s holding &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/technology/activities/Tech2021/"&gt;its Technology Day event&lt;/a&gt; to show off what it’s been working on in its R&amp;amp;D labs, and this year, we got some great visuals of tech the company’s been working on. Amidst the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ugil99qEyX8"&gt;rehashes of the PS5’s haptics and 3D audio&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBO6ZVrFBYc"&gt;demo reel&lt;/a&gt; of Sony’s admittedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217554/sony-selling-microled-production-display-mandalorian-production"&gt;awesome displays for making virtual movie sets&lt;/a&gt;, we got to see a robot hand that Sony said could figure out grip strength depending on what it was picking up, a slightly dystopian-sounding “global sensing system,” and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5hZNV"&gt;Perhaps the most interesting thing Sony showed off was a headset that featured OLED displays with “4K-per-inch” resolution. While the headset Sony used in its presentation was very clearly something intended for lab and prototype use, the specs Sony laid out for the panels were reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429523/playstation-vr-ps5-rumors-eye-tracking-foviated-render-4k-screen-haptics"&gt;rumors swirling around the PlayStation VR 2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hfOK3_X-yMnj4CS5glhM8SyvhBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071607/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_16.30.05.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This probably isn’t what the next PlayStation headset will look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3G4cxC"&gt;They don’t exactly line up, though; Sony said the headset it showed off was 8K, given the 4K display per eye, and the PS VR 2 will supposedly only be 4K overall with 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye. Still, it’s exciting that Sony is working on VR-focused panels, along with latency reduction tech for them. In a Q&amp;amp;A session for journalists, Sony wouldn’t answer questions about when the displays would show up in an actual product but said that various divisions were already looking into how they could integrate them into products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SBCojs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkJJA0PCOxI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gBsFFw"&gt;Sony also showed off a robotic grabber, a mechanized pincer that could be used to let a machine pick up objects. While that’s nothing new, Sony did say that its version had the ability to precisely control grip strength depending on what it was holding, letting it hold things tightly enough that they don’t slip (and adjusting if they do start to fall) without crushing delicate items like a vegetable or flower.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AK4UPgdwyCxxPYbszxegP-6FPB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073689/ezgif_7_4177876d6075.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh to have a robot hand me a rose and then be able to hold my hand without crushing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9JdzF"&gt;Sony says the grabber could be used to cook or line up items in a shop window, though to get that level of functionality, it would have to be paired with a way to move and AI that let it determine what objects it needed to pick up. It’s hard to imagine we’ll see that sort of thing in public any time soon, but it does make for an impressive demo. It’s also nice that Sony made it look very robotic rather than having it look like a hand — I’ve had my fill of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22819328/humanoid-robot-eerily-lifelike-facial-expressions"&gt;eerily human-looking robot parts&lt;/a&gt; for this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fVjngG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6vX7FcBQMs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XejNNl"&gt;Sony’s presentation also had some neat visuals to go with other projects, as well as another look at some devices we’ve seen before. It showed off some machine-learning supersampling tech (similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics"&gt;Nvidia’s DLSS system&lt;/a&gt;), which it said it could use to improve resolution and performance for ray-traced rendering. A GIF of Sony’s comparison shots would ruin the quality, but you can check it out in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WELE6p"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AL7Odi8wCO8?rel=0&amp;amp;start=231" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCNStaC8deGruFUNXmjiXafAUuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073663/ezgif_7_a538a62c91c0.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sony had some neat visuals to show off its depth sensor that it says can be used for Lidar systems &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056404/sony-vision-s-electric-concept-prototype-first-look-ces-2020" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;in cars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gctRAG"&gt;Finally, Sony talked about its “Mimamori” system, which it said is designed to watch over the planet. When I was watching the presentation in real time, I started to get a little worried when I saw this slide:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KKTselBaQJ2GPYZsvqmTCyx6zUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071665/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_16.56.11.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatcha up to here Sony?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8dhfYz"&gt;Sony went on to explain, though, that its idea was to use satellites to gather data from sensors placed all over the earth, made to collect information about soil moisture, temperature, and more. Its pitch is that it could help scientists gather information on how the climate is changing and help farmers adapt to those changes. Mimamori seemed like it was closer to a pitch than a prototype, but it shows that Sony is at least looking into how it can leverage &lt;a href="https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/products_en/eltres/technology.html"&gt;some of its tech&lt;/a&gt; to help deal with climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BRGYcV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QborgyXIkk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLvFiM"&gt;While some of the ideas Sony showed off seem like moonshots, it’s interesting to get a peek into what Sony’s doing in its labs, beyond creating PlayStations and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"&gt;Spider-Verse sequels&lt;/a&gt;. Even if we don’t end up getting consumer devices out of it, at least we got some pretty cool futuristic visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat is even more affordable today </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rikk4ve-Dbaex2opcFzYLFT5Tg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244108/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the Alexa app to control Amazon’s Smart Thermostat, which is currently enjoying its first discount.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="85aJOu"&gt;Even without a discount attached to it, Amazon’s surprisingly great Smart Thermostat is a good deal in itself. After our reviewer spent a decade testing almost every smart thermostat since the launch of the Nest Learning Thermostat, she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; it to be one of the best yet. That’s saying a lot, and it’s pretty impressive given this is an affordable smart thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJWOjc"&gt;The thermostat is discounted for the first time today, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $47.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — a 20 percent discount on its typical $59.99. Built in collaboration with Resideo, the makers of Honeywell Home Thermostat Technology, this gadget is capable of learning and adapting to your schedule, just like more expensive thermostats out there. With the price in mind, it does lack some features. Perhaps the most egregious omission is that it doesn’t integrate with platforms or voice assistants besides Alexa. Yet, if you’re looking for a good basic thermostat with which you can control the temperature of your home (even while traveling), this is definitely worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="took9t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SE0OPc"&gt;Sonos is offering great deals on its refurbished products through December 31st. You can buy, for example, the latest generation of the Sonos One for &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=VergeDeals120821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fone-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $100 less than its full $219 retail cost when purchased new. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16490866/sonos-one-speaker-review-alexa"&gt;first-generation&lt;/a&gt; is also on sale for $129, but lacks Bluetooth Low Energy support, has a slower processor, and comes with less memory than the second-gen. Meanwhile, the first-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt; soundbar is selling for &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8532386-11556673?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-white-b-stock.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$259&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to $399, the price when purchased new. While it lacks Dolby Atmos support like the second-gen model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; it’s still a competent smart speaker that shares many features in common with the newer version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZAD3l"&gt;All of the discounted refurbished products will arrive in a box with the original accessories and cables. They’ve also been certified directly from Sonos, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21530290/refurbished-tech-products-gadgets-where-to-buy-amazon-ebay"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; the company has tested and given each an internal and external cleaning and inspection. Each product also comes with a one-year warranty and a 45-day money-back guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N3fELm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10523576"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="TMUytT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDSO0B"&gt;If you prefer earbuds to bulkier headphones, you might want to grab the second-gen Apple AirPods at Amazon since they’re just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99&lt;/a&gt;. That matches its second-lowest price after we saw the earbuds drop to $89 during early Black Friday sales. It’s also a lower price than what we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when they were selling for around $110. Typically around $129, this model offers excellent wireless performance, reliable battery life, and is easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zVYh9F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y89YAm"&gt;If you’ve got a little more cash to spare, and you’re in the market for a pair of excellent over-ear headphones, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals120821"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is bundling Sony’s WH-1000XM4 with Mophie’s Power Boost XXL 20,800mAh battery power bank for just $248. That matches the Black Friday and Cyber Monday price many retailers sold the $349.99 headphones for just by themselves. Mophie’s power bank typically sells for $39.95 itself, so this bundle is valued at around $390. Plus, the bundle also includes a small microfiber cleaning cloth to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6501a"&gt;As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; (and as you’ve probably read in our deals coverage many times before), Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM4 boast the company’s best noise-canceling capabilities yet. We gave the headphones a 9/10 partly because of it, along with their stellar comfort, sound quality, and the fact they also let you connect to two Bluetooth sources simultaneously (this was missing in the XM3). Meanwhile, Mophie’s portable power bank comes with two USB-A ports so you can charge your headphones and phone simultaneously, and it charges via Micro USB. The company claims as well that its 20,800mAh battery offers up to 77 hours of extra battery life, but note we haven’t tested this product, so we can’t confirm if this is truly the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfWTW"&gt;Of course, if you prefer to just buy the headphones by themselves, many are still selling them for just $248, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gyfQV3mV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="90yl6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10907261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezhNoP"&gt;Govee’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22566408/govee-immersion-ambilight-tv-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Immersion TV LED backlights&lt;/a&gt; are fun, colorful lights that can make watching movies and gaming look more immersive. They sync to the colors on your screen (it supports 55- to 65-inch TVs) to make it appear as if its bezels have disappeared and the colors are expanding onto your walls. In other words, they’ll make for some pretty cool holiday gifts. Govee’s backlighting kit released in 2020 is back on sale at Amazon. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $63.99 once you clip the $20 off coupon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the product’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsGMEZ"&gt;Govee is also selling this product direct &lt;a href="https://us.govee.com/products/immersion-tv-backlights" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $62.99&lt;/a&gt; as a part of its holiday sale, which is a little cheaper. Still, if you prefer to shop from Amazon or are a Prime member, the Amazon deal could be the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="plsQMm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10681491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zH8SZ"&gt;For those still trying to nab a PlayStation 5 — or for those lucky enough to already have one — one of our picks for the best SSDs compatible with the PS5 is currently at its best price ever. Normally $229.99, Amazon is selling the 1TB version of Samsung’s 980 Pro for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169.99&lt;/a&gt; instead. That’s a $60 discount on Samsung’s blazingly fast SSD, which is one of the few kinds of drives on the market that meet Sony’s performance requirements. It’s also compatible with PC, though you’ll only get its advertised PCIe 4.0 speeds if you have a compatible motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyhOxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10678130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="NPAcho"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PlayStation 5 will be available for Walmart Plus members on Wednesday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821037/ps5-playstation-5-restock-available-walmart-plus-queue-deal-sale"},{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VzJPoI"&gt;Shifting away from SSDs to gaming controllers, Razer’s Kishi is a great gift for gamers on the go traveling this holiday season. You can clamp it onto your Android phone and easily transform it into a Nintendo Switch lookalike. It’s also compatible with many games available on a variety of cloud-based gaming platforms, including Google Stadia, Microsoft xCloud, and more. It’s typically a bit pricey at $79.99, but right now both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9PMTEDGaM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are taking nearly 50 percent off, selling it for $44.99 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wf8m22"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882522"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CH57MS"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals happening:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="title"&gt;If you’re an iPhone 12 Mini owner, Amazon is selling Apple’s black MagSafe leather case for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$23.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $59 — a 59 percent discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CUE8yB"&gt;Right now, PayPal is selling a $100 GameStop gift card for &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/gifts/brands/gamestopdecgood"&gt;$90&lt;/a&gt; that you can also use at ThinkGeek, EB Games, Babbage’s, and Planet X stores.

    <title>Biden wants the US government to eliminate CO2 emissions by 2050</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN-AUTOMOBILE-ENVIRONMENT-GM-ENERGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCa0_Ue66CN9ZUrDknbamT5Jz1o=/0x1:3497x2332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70246056/1236627157.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mnCXiB"&gt;President Joe Biden signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-catalyzing-americas-clean-energy-economy-through-federal-sustainability/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday outlining a sweeping plan for the federal government to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Under the plan, the government would spend billions of dollars to purchase electric vehicles, upgrade federal buildings, and leverage the power of the government to shift to cleaner forms of electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f43JPn"&gt;It won’t be a completely seamless transition, though. The government would stop purchasing gas-powered passenger cars in 2027 but would only achieve 100 percent electric vehicle purchases by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kvblGX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden’s order would direct the government to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent by the end of the decade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXOjO9"&gt;Biden’s order would direct the government to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent by the end of the decade before reaching full carbon neutrality by 2050. Based on the scope of the government’s electricity demands, the president expects this would help add 10 gigawatts of clean electricity to the grid by 2030. The plan also calls for federal buildings to be “net-zero” by 2045, including a 50 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2032. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgzklL"&gt;The 2050 deadline for carbon neutrality is in line with what scientists have found is necessary globally to prevent catastrophic climate change. And it reflects &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;the president’s broader goals&lt;/a&gt; to slash greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. Under the Paris Agreement, the US agreed to cut its emissions by up to 52 percent this decade compared to 2005 levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBdHdx"&gt;There’s a growing urgency to reduce planet-warming pollution at the federal level. Experts have determined that global carbon emissions need to drop by half this decade and reach close to zero by the middle of the century in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and prevent some of the most devastating effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KymtGj"&gt;The US is the second-largest producer of greenhouse gases after China, but a lot of momentum was lost under former President Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement and rolled back regulations governing vehicle tailpipe emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BSM9Wx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US is the second-largest producer of greenhouse gases after China&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9gdSFz"&gt;Regarding electric vehicles, the executive order represents the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;fulfillment of a promise Biden made on the campaign trail&lt;/a&gt; to swap government fleet vehicles with American-made EVs. The second piece of his plan to spur the mass adoption of electric vehicles is to offer generous tax incentives, which is being debated in the Senate as part of the president’s Build Back Better plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muzC6U"&gt;As of 2020, there were nearly 657,506 vehicles in the federal government’s fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/vehicle-management-policy/federal-fleet-report"&gt;according to the General Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;. This includes 250,499 civilian vehicles, 181,462 military vehicles, and 225,545 post office vehicles. In total, that fleet represents $4.2 billion in vehicle leases, acquisitions, and purchases. And despite the pandemic, those vehicles traveled 4.16 billion miles in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vevcUq"&gt;The White House provided some early examples of how the government will begin to transition to using electric vehicles, including the Interior Department and US Park Police using electric motorcycles and dirt bikes, and the Department of Homeland Security field testing the Ford Mustang Mach-E as an enforcement vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTLVC1"&gt;Biden’s plan represents a validation for the EV investments made by automakers over the last several years. Ford has said it will spend $29 billion introducing a raft of new EVs, while GM has committed to spending $35 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025. Meanwhile, Tesla’s remarkable stock market rally over the last two years has made it the most valuable automaker in the world and its CEO, Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANrji9"&gt;Biden’s order may not be a direct win for Tesla, though, which has mostly focused on luxury and performance vehicles. Automakers that could benefit include Ford, which is working on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;electric version of its Transit vans&lt;/a&gt;, and GM, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;spun out a new company called BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt; focused on electric delivery vehicles. Both companies are in the process of rolling out electric trucks that would be useful for a variety of governmental purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cea9Rh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the industry will need to overcome delays related to the semiconductor shortage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJDUg2"&gt;But to achieve the government’s electric vehicle goals, the industry will need to overcome delays related to the semiconductor shortage and install enough charging stations to make EVs more practical. Last month, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;signed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt; into law, which includes $7.5 billion for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22765438/biden-infrastructure-bill-electric-vehicle-ev-charging-level-2"&gt;electric vehicle charging stations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RH37M8"&gt;The hope is that Biden’s order will help spur demand for clean electricity, zero-emissions vehicles, and more sustainable building materials across the country. “The government is a significant driver of demand,” Sarah Bloom Raskin, a Duke University law professor who served as treasury deputy secretary under President Barack Obama, told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, adding that federal procurement officers can “send a signal” even without adopting new regulations or passing legislation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple ruling put on hold after appeals court grants a stay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhhnGIA6YVp8MxJFlWN2Y26V12M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245982/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jIgGu"&gt;An appeals court has paused one of the most consequential parts of the Epic v. Apple ruling, &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21150555/order.pdf"&gt;placing a stay&lt;/a&gt; on the enforcement of the injunction issued by the lower court. As a result of the stay, Apple can maintain its IAP system as the sole source of in-app payments on iOS, despite the district court’s earlier ruling that the exclusive arrangement is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1Em08"&gt;The stay, issued Wednesday afternoon, does not reverse the earlier ruling but puts enforcement on hold until the appeals court can fully hear the case, a process that will likely take months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOvKZr"&gt;“Apple has demonstrated, at minimum, that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district court’s determination,” the ruling reads. “Therefore, we grant Apple’s motion to stay part (i) of paragraph (1) of the permanent injunction. The stay will remain in effect until the mandate issues in this appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU4TLH"&gt;Notably, the stay does not extend to the second part of the injunction, which dealt with user communications outside iOS. Specifically, the court ordered Apple to allow “communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.” That order will remain unaffected by the stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZrVrh"&gt;Apple will also remain bound by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;its agreement with the Japan Fair Steering Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which placed similar anti-steering restrictions on iOS outside the context of the Epic case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOST0D"&gt;In September, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers required Apple to allow third-party payment systems on iOS apps as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;a broader ruling that dismissed antitrust allegations&lt;/a&gt; brought by Fortnite developer Epic Games. Specifically, the court ruled that beginning December 9th, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667161/app-store-epic-ruling-difference-button-external-link"&gt;could no longer prohibit “buttons or external links”&lt;/a&gt; that direct users to payment systems outside the App Store, as the company previously had in its app store guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HJUzU"&gt;Epic Games declined to comment when reached by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqRNki"&gt;Apple had previously moved for an injunction from the district court to pause its order but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;was denied&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Hyatt begin rolling out hotel keys in Apple Wallet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aZJlWeDJdvLeptcVsB_PQp7yiNY=/0x0:5100x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245866/apple_hyatt_hotel_keys.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Using a hotel key stored in Apple Wallet | Photo by Hyatt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="schzpU"&gt;Apple is partnering with Hyatt to give some hotel guests the ability to store their room keys in their Apple Wallets, as announced in a post on &lt;a href="https://newsroom.hyatt.com/news-releases?item=124174#assets_all"&gt;Hyatt’s newsroom&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of checking your pockets for your room key, you’ll now be able to use your iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock your room, as well as any other areas around the hotel that require a key for entry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkVOqsVC9lD_s-1TszF6Tr5FLyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23073568/hyatt_apple_watch_unlock.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Hyatt&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Apple Watch can unlock your hotel room at participating Hyatt hotels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zUQSog"&gt;There are currently only six Hyatt hotels in the US that support this feature, although Hyatt says it plans to eventually include it in hotels worldwide. But for now, the participating hotels include: Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort and Spa, Hyatt House Chicago / West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas / Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont / Silicon Valley, and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5faq1"&gt;Just keep in mind that in order to use the feature, your iPhone will need iOS 15 or above, and your Apple Watch must run watchOS 8 and above. Hyatt notes that once you’ve completed your reservation, you can add your room key to your Apple Wallet through the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-of-hyatt/id476639005"&gt;World of Hyatt&lt;/a&gt; app. The key will display your room number and will only activate when your room is ready for check-in. If you need to make any changes to your room, you can do so through the app, and your key will be updated automatically. Your key will deactivate once you’ve checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpfb4U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Apple previewed this feature&lt;/a&gt; at WWDC 2021 alongside its digital ID feature. Once launched, this will allow users in participating states to digitally store their identification cards in their Apple Wallets. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;Arizona and Georgia&lt;/a&gt; were supposed to be the first states to let residents store their IDs on their iPhones, its rollout &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799338/apple-digital-driver-license-delay-2022-ios-15"&gt;has been delayed until 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard victim says she was demoted after reporting sexual harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FpA0SBx2jW9LOKR7XqqYb2QT2VI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245839/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GdfR8p"&gt;Today, in front of Blizzard Entertainment’s Irvine, California headquarters, Christine (her last name withheld to protect her privacy) &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXOuBCopsvw/"&gt;held a press conference&lt;/a&gt; in which she spoke about her experiences of sexual harassment and retaliation while employed at the embattled game developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XO6tX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content warning&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;This story contains discussions of sexual harassment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1wqy5"&gt;Christine gave a tearful statement detailing how working at Blizzard was her “dream job” but how she was then subjected to inappropriate touching, rude comments about her body, and invitations to have sex with her supervisors. When Christine complained to HR, she said she was told the people who made those comments were “just joking” and that they “did nothing wrong by law.” She further claimed that after making those reports, she was demoted, denied her full profit sharing benefits, and received minimal raises in the four years of her employment at Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y6dYM"&gt;Christine’s attorney, Lisa Bloom, also spoke at the press conference. Bloom, a celebrity lawyer known for representing survivors in high-profile sexual assault cases who also once made headlines for taking an advisory role in serial-predator Harvey Weinstein’s assault case, detailed the many suits brought against Activision Blizzard for its culture of sexual harassment and retaliation. She notably criticized the consent decree between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;Activision Blizzard and the EEOC&lt;/a&gt;, saying that some of the parameters set forth by this decree had not yet happened within the agreed-upon timeline. She also said that the $18 million victim compensation fund established by the consent decree wasn’t enough. “Given that there are hundreds of victims, I think we can all agree that the $18 million number is woefully inadequate,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ED2tIW"&gt;Bloom then outlined three demands of the company: a streamlined process for victims to resolve their claims with an increased compensation fund in excess of $100 million, a real apology from corporate leadership, and an investigation by a neutral third party into the damage Activision Blizzard’s culture of harassment has had on employees’ careers and a plan to repair that damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SLprB"&gt;The press conference ended with Bloom asking other victims to join them in the fight against Activision Blizzard. “We don’t want Christine to stand alone. I know she does not stand alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdkJCl"&gt;This press conference is the latest example of employee activism at Activision Blizzard. Last week, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;layoffs hit the QA department of Raven Studios&lt;/a&gt;, a Wisconsin-based Activision Blizzard subsidiary known for working on the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise, hundreds of workers across the Activision Blizzard ecosystem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;walked out in solidarity&lt;/a&gt;, making this the third walkout since news of the lawsuits broke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZXr8w"&gt;In October, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; stating that Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard’s CEO, knew about, enabled, and sometimes participated in the harassment himself. After calls for Kotick’s resignation from shareholders and employees, Activision Blizzard’s board of directors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/21/22795286/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-is-not-resigning-yet"&gt;affirmed their support for him&lt;/a&gt; even as the big three gaming companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/news/nintendo-issues-internal-response-to-activision-blizzard-reports/"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, expressed concerns about these developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBfNVB"&gt;Christine represents one of the first active employees of Blizzard Entertainment to publicly call out the company. Another outspoken Blizzard employee, Jessica Gonzales, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BlizzJess/status/1465714592189849613?s=20"&gt;resigned from the company&lt;/a&gt; in November after months of detailing how her open criticisms of her employer made her subject to harassment from some of her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41PbrH"&gt;In a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; an Activision Blizzard spokesperson said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGYL1h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We appreciate the courage of our current and former employees in coming forward with reports of misconduct, and we are truly sorry for any victims of people whose conduct did not live up to our values.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tYK7H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google releases first Android 12L beta for large-screen devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hl2nMx9xoOltgiai1zhOzPV5JaI=/164x0:1436x848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245382/Untitled_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Android 12L’s biggest features is a two-column UI for things like the notification shade and lock screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1QSJX"&gt;Google has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;its Android 12L update&lt;/a&gt; — the one designed to give its OS a better experience on tablets and large folding phones — is getting its first beta release today. While Beta 1 still seems very much pointed toward developers, it could be a chance to see what Google’s working on in a (slightly) more polished state than the developer preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H6vAt"&gt;With Android 12L, Google is adding a two-column layout for devices with larger screens, which will let you get at more information at once. For example, your quick settings and notifications can display side by side. Google’s also working to improve multitasking, letting you drag an app into split-screen mode from the taskbar (which you can also use to quickly switch between apps).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="12L multitasking" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FD3D0_mO4f485sllpdRAZ3BUjzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959161/12L_multitasking.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says 12L should make it easier to multitask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n74WU5"&gt;As with the developer preview, Google says you should be able to run the beta on an actual large-screen device if you have a Lenovo Tab P12 Pro, though it does say that the beta won’t be available until “a later date.” If you don’t have one of those lying around or don’t feel like waiting, you can also run the 12L beta &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/12L/get#resizable-emulator"&gt;in an emulator&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for how it’ll look when it becomes more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUCadF"&gt;Google also says you’ll be able to install 12L on your “supported Pixel device,” a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#faq"&gt;list that currently includes&lt;/a&gt; the Pixel 3A through the Pixel 5A, though you won’t be able to test out the large screen UI. If you really just want to be on the bleeding edge, though, or are testing out apps that make use of 12L’s new APIs, you can &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices"&gt;enroll your Pixel here&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that as the first beta, it’s probably a little rough around the edges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emGA8ro9D4lNLBPQkh0oh092_xQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66870539/acastro_200323_1777_gamingMouse_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever your budget or grip style is, we’ve found the best gaming mouse for you.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Multiple picks for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="eiRucN"&gt;Finding the right gaming mouse amid all the options available can be a struggle. There are a lot of factors to consider, like how it looks, how it feels in the hand, the button selection and arrangement, the quality of its sensor, and whether you want a mouse that’s wireless or wired. These details, minor as they may seem, can have a major impact on your experience with the mouse you choose to buy. On the other hand, sometimes mice have features that get overblown and aren’t really worth the extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOD0oD"&gt;If you’re looking for a wireless gaming mouse, you’ll want the best that your budget allows for. We’re going to make this decision easy for you. The best wireless gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4BM851?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=0e8456acb6ff5049a8ca9a3010f859d7&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most well-rounded choice if you want comfort, a long-lasting battery, and the best selection and arrangement of buttons. But if you want some alternatives, there are some new, solid contenders below that offer different designs and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbAxZF"&gt;If you are looking for the best wired gaming mouse, we’ve recently made some major changes to this section. The Razer DeathAdder V2 has been dethroned by the more feature-dense &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frazer-basilisk-v3-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-chroma-rbg-lighting-black%2F6475703.p%3FskuId%3D6475703&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt;. And for people who don’t want to spend $70, there’s a cheaper alternative that you might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBKPjC"&gt;Like our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;best gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;, what follows focuses mostly on newer models that you’re more likely to see on store shelves as opposed to older models, which may be tougher to find in stock — even if they might still be worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OI1GuQ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3lO4oA"&gt;The best wireless gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed ($120)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjQweePnmr6NqW900etrvOctA34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219644/akrales_190507_3407_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech G502 Lightspeed  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GenFNF"&gt;The Logitech G502 Lightspeed is a great gaming mouse for discerning gamers who don’t want to compromise on much of anything — or for casual users who just want a good, solid mouse. It’s comfortable and feature-packed, and even though it’s wireless, it’s a fast and accurate performer that doesn’t feel at a disadvantage against wired mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJdIHm"&gt;At $150, the best doesn’t come cheap (though you can sometimes find it for around $100 these days). But if you’ve tossed around the idea of making an investment in a high-end wireless mouse, no other model that I tested for this buying guide justified its price so easily. The G502 Lightspeed has the best features of Logitech’s gaming and general-use mice all rolled into one. The main buttons deliver a satisfying bounce response when you tap them, and unlike some other popular models, they click easily no matter how you grip your hand on the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIq7sZ"&gt;This mouse also features a quick-release button, a feature borrowed from other Logitech consumer-focused and gaming mice. By default, the scroll wheel staggers down a single webpage with each step, which is how you expect a scroll wheel to work. Tapping the button releases the mechanism gripping the wheel, allowing it to freely sail to the bottom of a long page. It’s a small feature, but one that gives the mouse more versatility in certain situations, like being able to quickly scroll through your inventory when in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRLAe6Nq6SE9DoYoV5sxbZJTxrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219645/akrales_190507_3407_0026.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Lightspeed may not have the most inviting design, but it’s incredibly comfortable to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q3DLU"&gt;Another nice feature is the inclusion of 16 grams of weights you can insert into the mouse to give it more resistance. A mouse’s weight comes down to personal preference, and that could vary from game to game. This mouse is among the few modern wireless devices to give you the flexibility to change up the weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2V6RE"&gt;The fact that the G502 Lightspeed is wireless makes it that much easier to bring along with you wherever you go. But if you just can’t swing the $150 price, I suggest that you check out the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;, which is the wired version of this mouse. It has almost every feature that you’ll find in the wireless model — except, you know, wireless capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBe8su"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1K4jR3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7xlEt"&gt;The runner-up: Corsair M65 Ultra Wireless ($130)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair M65 Ultra Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i2jkT3Tx63B1LBX33LDCe53SJcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067610/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of fit and finish, the M65 Ultra Wireless is identical to its wired counterpart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OxTTkG"&gt;Corsair’s M65 has long been one of my favorite mouse designs. It’s hefty, bulky, and each of its buttons are big enough that I never whiff on hitting them. That all might sound like it amounts to an unwieldy mouse to some (and it will be, if you prefer lighter mice that have a lower profile), yet it always makes me feel like I have total control over every aspect of the mouse. So it wasn’t a surprise that I enjoyed using the new M65 Ultra Wireless, which keeps the same design (including the ability to add up to 18g of weights), but lops off the cable, adding Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvkqcx"&gt;Just like the wired version, this one comes with extra weights, letting you boost it from 110g (its default weight) to 128g after you add three weights. As several wireless mice are gunning to be a featherweight, averaging at around 65g, this one’s a monster comparatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bnxVKm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909065" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IcMvHo"&gt;I enjoy using the M65 Ultra Wireless as much as the G502 Lightspeed in-game, though there was one experimental feature on Corsair’s mouse that gave it the edge: its gyroscope that can trigger preset actions when you tilt the mouse. After you customize this setting in Corsair’s iCue companion software, you can do things like reload or anything else by giving the mouse a tilt. It’s satisfying to use and undeniably clever, though this never became second nature to me. That said, I could see this being the kind of feature that earns this mouse some die-hard fans. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair M65 Ultra Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2TrjyALbhq-keuEuKwwSzEbDs2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067603/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M65 Ultra Wireless’ side buttons are delightfully big, making them easy to feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gpY31v"&gt;The fit and finish of the M65 Ultra Wireless is on par with some of the best mice out there, though I missed one too many features to make this my main mouse. Namely, the G502 Lightspeed’s button that lets the scroll wheel spin freely when pressed is essential because it makes the mouse more useful in both games and non-play time when I’m working. I like that the Corsair’s mouse charges via USB-C, while the G502 Lightspeed is using Micro USB. If these differences don’t irk you, and you’re alright with a heavy mouse, you might really like the M65 Ultra Wireless. As for me, it’s one that I want to keep on my desk for some games, but not for nonstop use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vOoCiS"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WRps16"&gt;Other good wireless options&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-tXZtDJOTsSPvJgWBDrdJ3OsLrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067611/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G303 Shroud makes for an understated addition to your desk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5bmll"&gt;Logitech recently released a wireless take on its G303 Daedalus mouse in partnership with pro gamer and streamer Shroud. It’s called the G303 Shroud. And while this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Wireless-tunable-Weights/dp/B08L9HPLP1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129.99 mouse&lt;/a&gt; is relatively light on features (and mostly identical to its wired counterpart, with two side buttons and a DPI switcher being its only supplemental buttons), it’s a comfortable, long-lasting option that seems particularly well suited to first-person shooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFUrM5"&gt;Compared to the G502 Lightspeed above, the G303 Shroud doesn’t exactly cradle your hand, though gamers who don’t want to smother a mouse with their grip might prefer how this one feels. It has an ambidextrous shape (though its thumb buttons suit right-handed mouse users), and the translucent plastic sides jut out a bit to fit within your thumb joint and serve as a stopper for your pinky on the other side. The thumb buttons here are easy to reach for, though I wish they were thicker to minimize the chance of misfiring during a heated match. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzVEV0SDPTmtLDwrwCtMFuXJEBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067609/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish the G303’s side buttons were thicker, but they’re more than serviceable as is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DJ4z1H"&gt;The G303 Shroud is a simplistic gaming mouse that some minimalists will take to for its distinct lack of flair — the only LED is its battery indicator near the scroll wheel. The G303 didn’t blow me away with its design or with how it feels in the hand, but it’s a solid option if you want a no-frills wireless gaming mouse — if you can swallow the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34H4GpKR93Xz1ejL3_3XCarRxQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984098/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LxusJS"&gt;Corsair’s Dark Core RGB Pro SE (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726258737981131320" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89&lt;/a&gt;) is a good pick if you want oodles of features. It offers USB-C charging and supports Qi wireless charging. This mouse can switch between 2.4GHz wireless mode via its included USB dongle (cleverly tucked under its removable, magnetic wing) or Bluetooth. Of course, you’ll get better results by using the dongle, but it’s great to have options. I found that the battery life, while decent, wasn’t quite as long lasting as the G502 Lightspeed or the Kone Pro Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOpEA3"&gt;Some smaller, but equally welcome, features here come in the form of that removable magnetic wing I just mentioned, which snaps onto its right side to let me comfortably rest my ring and pinky fingers. You might appreciate this most customizable design like I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9tGmNh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OXztCs"&gt;The best wired gaming mouse: Razer Basilisk V3 ($70)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KJMcde"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 has been my favorite wired gaming mouse for a while, mainly because it’s just so comfortable to use. But one of Razer’s newer mice, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt;, delivers the comfort that I’m looking for, along with several more features. One feature that I personally have a tough time living without is its new scroll wheel tech that can automatically alternate between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes depending on the intensity of your scrolling. This is a feature that comes in handy in and out of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rkAF9GigtoFNF7N99FqpSZ6qzcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067607/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DPI clutch (also known as the sniper button) is now fixed to the Basilisk V3. It was removable in the previous iteration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="25cJZk"&gt;The Basilisk V3 is, in many ways, identical to its predecessor, with a familiar, ergonomic design that’s similar to the G502 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse. There’s a large, grippy thumb rest on its site, sharing that space with two generously sized thumb buttons and a DPI clutch that can make sniping easier (unlike the V2, where this clutch was optional, it’s fastened to the V3). This mouse has some other niceties, like a tilting scroll wheel and support for multiple profiles saved to its onboard storage. If you’re inclined to customize your RGB LEDs, this mouse has a section around its entire body that can let LEDs shine onto your mousepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAzpUr"&gt;The $69.99 Basilisk V3 costs the same amount as the DeathAdder V2 at many retailers, and for the price, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a mouse that can offer more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WDXFps"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909072" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zVjY6B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whOXje"&gt;The runner-up: Cooler Master MM720 (starts at $30)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7fF8B"&gt;During the latest update to this guide, no mouse that I went hands-on with surprised me as much as Cooler Master’s MM720, a $50 model that, as it turns out, has a bit of a cult following for a good reason. It’s one of the most comfortable mice that I’ve used, with a design that’s equally suited to people who want a cozy grip during work hours and those who have a claw grip while gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuxwdM"&gt;The MM720’s design is undeniably divisive (and goofy) at first blush, with a large section jutting out of its right side to give your ring or pinky fingers a cozy place to rest. There’s much about this mouse’s design that one person may love, while another might curse its existence. Like all mice, it comes down to personal preference, grip style, and the games that you like to play. As for me, it feels great to use, despite the fact that I don’t tend to use a claw-style grip. Instead, my medium-sized hand fits over the mouse’s barely curved surface, with my fingertips hanging off the edge of the mouse slightly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cooler Master MM720" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3TJ5NxN5-npgqFMakX5vW9nWop8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067605/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MM720 is one of the lightest wired mice around at 49 grams. Yet, it doesn’t feel like a toy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIqmg"&gt;The MM720 is the lightest mouse that I’ve tested yet, coming in at 49 grams. Despite that ultra lightweight build, it doesn’t feel hollow or cheap — not that this mouse has much to prove at its $29.99 price. It features two main mouse buttons, an LED-lit scroll wheel that indicates the DPI sensitivity when you press its bottom-located DPI-switching button. Its two thumb buttons on the side are slightly bulbous, as to make them easier to feel. There are just a lot of smart design choices here considering the low price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXD6D5"&gt;If you’re shopping for a wired mouse on a budget, and you know you don’t want oodles of features, consider picking up Cooler Master’s MM720. There’s less at stake with the cost compared to pricier mice, and if your taste in mice and grip style sound anything like mine, you stand to be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="d6EsI3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="opSJY5"&gt;Other good wired options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAQPG"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 is proof that a wired mouse doesn’t need countless features to be worth the money. It just needs to be extremely good at the fundamentals, including being comfy enough to use for hours at a time with games that require quick reflexes, having a simple assortment of buttons that take little to no time to master, and, of course, great performance. If this matches what you want in a mouse, the &lt;s&gt;$70&lt;/s&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Gaming-Mouse-Programmable/dp/B082G5SPR5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=TVFJWP3TYAQJ&amp;amp;keywords=deathadder%2Bv2&amp;amp;qid=1638979126&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;sprefix=deathadder%2Celectronics%2C155&amp;amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzTkU4SUdXNzgyS1hZJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDQ4OTYwMVBRNVhIQTNYWTZINCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODcxNzA3TldVQVBLVjZEMVU2JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$43 Razer DeathAdder V2 is the one to get&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Prime Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CU-ZSEdoLEZdTXD28DuCS5oJ31g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528993/primeplus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UMPQwJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743526088835385586" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The &lt;s&gt;$80&lt;/s&gt; $40 Prime Plus&lt;/a&gt; is the middle child in SteelSeries’ new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22445746/steelseries-prime-arctis-headset-wireless-plus-gaming-mouse-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made-for-esports Prime lineup&lt;/a&gt; of mice, yet it’s the most interesting and value-packed. It feels just like the others in that lineup, both in the way it fits your hand with a high arch that slopes to the right, as well as with what SteelSeries aptly calls “crispy” clicks. They’re a little louder than your average gaming mouse, and they have a more tactile feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLVmkp"&gt;What sets the Prime Plus apart from the others in the Prime lineup (as well as the other options below) is the OLED screen and controls built into its underside. There’s no driver required to change in-depth settings. You hold the bottom button once it’s plugged in and use the scroll wheel to navigate a menu that lets you change things like the brightness of the OLED and the LED illuminating the scroll wheel. More importantly, you can adjust sensitivity, polling rate (125Hz to 1000Hz), and liftoff distance right from this display. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TeVjwP"&gt;As I mentioned near the top of this article, if $150 for Logitech’s wireless G502 Lightspeed is too much for you to spend, you might want to consider this wired version, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G502-Performance-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07GBZ4Q68?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;s&gt;$50&lt;/s&gt; $40 G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;. It has the same design as our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse — actually, it’s basically the same in almost every way, down to the kind of sensor it uses and its adjustable weights. That makes it almost as good, though some might take issue with its thick braided cable and the somewhat slippery plastic used on the scroll wheel that isn’t on the Lightspeed model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsB5ht"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="KPe1W2"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2021: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91Ojp27YU24CRpqeGNGMFxMlSuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0001.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops under $800 from HP, Lenovo, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ItC6sO"&gt;The best cheap laptops are getting better and better for less than $800. The question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, running Windows 10. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops, as well as those priced under $800. But we’ve tested dozens of systems below $800, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Other best cheap laptops of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop ofof 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $860&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the clamshell Chromebook to buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best laptop under $800&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cIbAld"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best student laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga C740 is a sturdy aluminum laptop for any use case, making it one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing a new way to let you add content warnings to posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpaqYLTl_l4g7qo4x90OsZxBt8Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245150/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NvgzEB"&gt;Twitter is piloting a new feature that will let users add specific content warnings to individual photos and videos sent out in tweets. The platform noted that the feature would be available to “some” users during the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EvFNz1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;People use Twitter to discuss what’s happening in the world, which sometimes means sharing unsettling or sensitive content. We’re testing an option for some of you to add one-time warnings to photos and videos you Tweet out, to help those who might want the warning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LCUA5QCoOV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LCUA5QCoOV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1468317145423511554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Scf8iu"&gt;Although Twitter currently has a way to add content warnings to tweets, the only way to do it is to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings"&gt;add the warning to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your tweets&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, every photo or video you post will have a content warning, regardless of whether it contains sensitive material or not. The new feature it’s testing lets you add the warning to single tweets and apply specific categories to that warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHB3Fv"&gt;As shown in the video that Twitter posted, it appears that when you’re editing an image or video, tapping the flag icon on the bottom right corner of the toolbar lets you add a content warning. The next screen lets you categorize the warning, with choices including “nudity,” “violence,” or “sensitive.” Once you post the tweet, the image or video will appear blurred out, and it’s overlaid with a content warning that explains why you flagged it. Users can click through the warning if they want to view the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCqHpp"&gt;If you fail to flag content when you post sensitive material, Twitter will — as it has already been doing — rely on user reports to decide whether or not your content should have a warning. In addition to its content warning experiment, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822878/twitter-testing-changes-report-tweet-abuse-suspicious-behavior"&gt;Twitter announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying out a “human-first” way to handle the reporting process. Instead of asking the user what rules the tweet is breaking, it will give the user the chance to describe what exactly happened, and based on that response, it will determine a specific violation.&lt;/p&gt;
