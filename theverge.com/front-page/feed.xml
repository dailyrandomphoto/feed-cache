    <title>The ‘Charlie bit my finger’ video is being auctioned as an NFT — then deleted ‘forever’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wH4ZMr-zXS9tRpyMcoKRLOO2pM=/52x0:457x270/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297806/hqdefault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HDCYT" target="_blank"&gt;Image: HDCYT on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbpNKC"&gt;The creators of the classic “Charlie bit my finger - again !” video are now auctioning it off as an NFT, but with a twist. At the end of the auction, which will begin on May 22nd, the original video will be deleted from YouTube forever, according to a press release, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM"&gt;where it currently has over 880 million views&lt;/a&gt;. The auction will kick off on the video’s 14th anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="HTKfSl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfahRo"&gt;Since NFTs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;exploded onto the cultural landscape&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, we’ve seen plenty of early-to-mid 2000s memes being sold on the blockchain, with many of them fetching higher prices than I would’ve ever have imagined. A non-exhaustive list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7ltPvv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat&lt;/a&gt;: sold for around $590,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gRWYN"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313211/deal-with-it-meme-nft-auction-ryder-ripps"&gt;The Deal with It glasses&lt;/a&gt;: sold for around $23,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VjpOds"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;Disaster Girl&lt;/a&gt;: sold for around $500,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rL4ndP"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322131/nyan-cat-creator-nft-memes-memeconomy"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt;: sold for around $64,400&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="00IY4t"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422993/david-after-dentist-meme-nft-real-life"&gt;David After Dentist&lt;/a&gt;: sold for around $11,500&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vGiLCq"&gt;Seeing these numbers, some people (including myself) have snidely said something along the lines of “why would you pay that much for something that’s not actually scarce? I can see Nyan Cat on the internet whenever I like.” Deleting &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/bvixd4/oc_top_10_most_viewed_youtube_videos_20062019/"&gt;one of the most well-known videos from YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does at least somewhat solve that argument, since whoever ends up with the NFT will actually be able to lay claim to something scarce. That is, assuming the buyer doesn’t just repost the video themselves (and ignoring the re-uploads that currently exist across the internet).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is merging WarnerMedia with Discovery to create a new media giant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nwwjvzHWMzUlHc9E3koBhmR9AU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297791/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zlmLDs"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this morning it’s spinning off its media business WarnerMedia and merging it with TV company Discovery, creating a major new player in the media world to compete with firms like Netflix and Disney that are leading the charge in streaming content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU3vZH"&gt;The deal will bring a lot of familiar names in the TV and film world under one roof. WarnerMedia owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio, responsible for such huge franchises as Harry Potter and Batman, while Discovery operates numerous cable networks including HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC. Both companies also have their own streaming platforms: HBO Max and Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7ZIN8"&gt;The boards of both AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery have approved the deal, but it will still have to be signed off by regulators. The deal is an all-stock transaction, which will see AT&amp;amp;T receive $43 billion in a combination of cash, debt securities, and debt retention on the part of WarnerMedia. AT&amp;amp;T shareholders will receive stock worth 71 percent of the new company, while Discovery’s shareholders will own the remaining 29 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FCsVQa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new company will be home to a huge array of shows and franchises&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cILLMi"&gt;The new company, which has yet to be named, will be led by Discovery chief executive David Zaslav. “It is super exciting to combine such historic brands, world class journalism and iconic franchises under one roof and unlock so much value and opportunity,” said Zaslav in a &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “With a library of cherished IP, dynamite management teams and global expertise in every market in the world, we believe everyone wins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGF784"&gt;The move is a significant U-turn for AT&amp;amp;T, which first &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/business/dealbook/att-agrees-to-buy-time-warner-for-more-than-80-billion.html"&gt;struck a deal&lt;/a&gt; to acquire WarnerMedia (then known as TimeWarner) in October 2016 for $85.4 billion. The acquisition was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/20/16655218/att-time-warner-merger-deal-blocked-us-justice-department-lawsuit"&gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt; by the Justice Department, who said it would lead to higher prices for consumers (though some suggested that President Trump’s dislike of Warner property CNN was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17152518/att-time-warner-merger-trial-justice-department"&gt;also a factor&lt;/a&gt;). But after years of wrangling in court, the deal was finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17466518/att-time-warner-acquisition-closes"&gt;approved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Now, just three years later, it’s being undone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30vpLe"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;’s Peter Kafka &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/5/16/22439154/warner-media-discovery-hbo-max-att-streaming-netflix-merger"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, the announcement follows something of a trend, as phone companies who tried to make it as media conglomerates divest themselves of unwanted assets. In February, AT&amp;amp;T announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/att-to-spin-off-directv-att-tv-now-and-u-verse-into-new-company.html"&gt;spinning off DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;, with the new firm valued at $16.25 billion (a significant loss of value: AT&amp;amp;T originally &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-directv-fcc-idUSKCN0PY26L20150724"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; DirecTV for $48.5 billion). And earlier this month Verizon announced it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22416854/aol-yahoo-sale-apollo-venetian-hotel-verizon"&gt;sold off AOL and Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;. The companies were bought by a private equity firm for $5 billion, roughly half what Verizon originally paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIvkr1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJl4t2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>That’s no moon: veteran Apple designer unveils $1,799 Cell Alpha speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_bRJ21C7WAVca9KUhQQ3v94mbs=/159x0:2180x1347/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297677/DiningRoom_000792_desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cell Alpha.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Syng&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lFPfmf"&gt;Christopher Stringer, an ex-Apple designer who worked on everything from the HomePod to the original iPhone during his 22 year-stint at the company, has unveiled his new startup’s debut speaker. It’s called the &lt;a href="https://syngspace.com/"&gt;Cell Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, a futuristic Death Star-shaped connected speaker with an emphasis on spatial audio. It costs $1,799, or $1,969 if you want the model with a floorstanding base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6qdbJ"&gt;The Cell Alpha has woofers on its top and bottom arranged into a “force-balanced” configuration. These are paired with three mid-range drivers that are distributed around its equator, where they’re presumably joined by a small thermal exhaust port — the Cell Alpha’s only known weakness. Jokes aside, Stringer’s company Syng claims this three-driver configuration (dubbed “The Triphone”) is able to project sound with “pinpoint accuracy” around a room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzLu9B2KxDcht7VtIghWwzvDWzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519802/LivingRoomProductShot_003338_desktop.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Syng&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two of the floorstanding models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vjorxx"&gt;Syng is making big claims about the spatial audio capabilities of the Cell Alpha. It’s styling it as the world’s first “Triphonic” speaker, because it offers spatial audio capabilities beyond the stereo audio that’s long been the traditional standard. In practical terms it’s supposed to allow the speaker to fill an entire room with surround sound audio, creating the impression that specific sounds or instruments are coming from distinct areas of the room. There are three microphones built into the speaker’s stand to measure the geometry of the space it’s in, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16976906/apple-homepod-review-smart-speaker"&gt;similar to the HomePod&lt;/a&gt;, which helps it create the impression of surround sound using just a single speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0wg7Al_mBbaBqgpsrshr8ta2qs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519824/Turntable_000597_desktop.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Syng&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the model of the speaker with a table stand is hefty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j1HjEl"&gt;While Syng says one speaker is capable of offering surround sound, anyone with $5,397 to spend can pair three Cell Alpha speakers together in a single room to get “the fullest expression of Triphonic audio.” According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4a88a13-47c3-4bb4-a627-704fdf0c392b"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Syng hopes to generate revenue from licensing out its audio technology in addition to selling hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIJZse"&gt;In terms of connectivity, Syng says the Cell Alpha supports AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect over Wi-Fi. Physical connectivity is handled by a pair of USB-C ports, and Syng also says it’s planning on releasing a USB-C to HDMI cable to let the Cell Alpha connect to TVs (it can also output sound from a TV using AirPlay). A companion Syng Space app is available for setup and playback control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZpH4KPtuY766L97TiFHcO_UYYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519825/MusicStudioSetup_002481_desktop.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Syng&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-C ports handle physical connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DabCuw"&gt;Syng currently has around 50 employees &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-apple-designer-you-never-heard-of-making-noise/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and is reported to have raised $15 million in funding. The &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report last year said these employees include ex-Apple designers and engineers, as well as former Nest, Ring, Nike, and Facebook employees. Others have reportedly joined from the audio companies Harman and Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRVHZW"&gt;The Cell Alpha is available to purchase now from Syng’s website. As of this writing, shipping is expected in six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple teases major Music announcement as lossless streaming rumors mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/114Qih1BN4Gm7ubZptERHIF8OQU=/1x0:1111x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297485/msedge_ebejRVkHMS.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the teaser in Apple Music’s web app.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://music.apple.com" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MjXNwG"&gt;Apple is teasing a major Apple Music announcement. “Get ready,” a post in the service’s Browse tab reads, “music is about to change forever.” Tapping the image reveals an animated video, though it just consists of the music streaming service’s logo spinning in place. The teaser, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/16/apple-music-about-to-change-forever/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first reported by MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is believed to refer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Apple Music’s rumored lossless and hi-res music streaming&lt;/a&gt; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpuSpB"&gt;A launch of the new higher quality streaming is believed to be imminent after code referencing “Lossless” and “Hi Res Lossless” streaming tiers appeared in the service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;web apps&lt;/a&gt;. According to code in the Android app, the lossless tier will support music streaming at 24-bit/48Hz (a small step up from regular CD-quality 16-bit/44.1kHz), while the hi-res lossless tier will stream at 24-bit/192 kHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ScrJRu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/BEsuEUK7tr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BEsuEUK7tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1394046356868771844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlFqXh"&gt;Code in the Android app warns that these higher quality tiers will required more storage space and data to stream compared to existing quality. Apple Music’s current high quality tier consumes 6 MB of data for a 3-minute song, but this could rise to 36 MB with lossless, and 145 MB with hi-res lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFFxST"&gt;The benefit, of course, should be better sounding audio, similar to what’s already offered by the likes of Tidal, Amazon Music HD, and Deezer. Spotify has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;its own lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; which is due to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJTpjf"&gt;As well as lossless and hi-res streaming, code snippets also include mentions of “Dolby Audio” and “Dolby Atmos,” &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The speculation is that the AirPods’ Spatial Audio features could be used in conjunction with Dolby’s surround sound technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAKwbk"&gt;Apple’s teaser doesn’t say when we should expect an official announcement, but some rumors suggest an announcement as early as Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdpd0a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sharp’s new flagship phone has a giant 1-inch camera sensor and Leica branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tr6IWS0pnW4PQD5469hI0pVApoo=/0x0:2090x1393/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297483/sharp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dP3AC6"&gt;It appears that Leica has found a new mobile camera partner, following Huawei’s sanctions-induced retreat from the international smartphone market. Sharp just announced the &lt;a href="https://jp.sharp/k-tai/aquos-r6/"&gt;Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, and its Leica-branded lens sits in front of what is now the largest camera sensor on any phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxTt8t"&gt;The 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor is similar in specs to what you’d find in Sony’s high-end RX100 compact cameras. It’s only the second 1-inch sensor ever to make its way into a smartphone, and the first to make its way into a phone from an traditional phone manufacturer — Panasonic released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Android-powered CM1 back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t exactly a mainstream device. The closest any current phone gets to a 1-inch sensor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which has a 1/1.12-inch component behind the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="waAUWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only one rear camera, but it’s a big one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nQ5jK0"&gt;The f/1.9 “Summicron” lens is also much wider than on other phones’ primary cameras, with an equivalent focal length of 19mm — that’s in ultrawide territory. Oddly, it’s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; outward-facing camera on the R6, so you’ll need to use digital zoom for more conventional focal lengths. The camera bump also houses an LED flash and a time-of-flight sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OGUE0"&gt;The Aquos R6’s other big feature is its display, which Sharp calls a Pro IGZO OLED. It’s a 6.6-inch 2,730 x 1,260 panel with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits and a variable refresh rate of 1 to 240Hz. Most Android phones to date haven’t been able to offer OLED displays with truly variable refresh rates that adapt to content in real time — this panel sounds like the most advanced available on any phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L183Uj"&gt;Elsewhere the R6’s specs are standard for a 2021 flagship: a Snapdragon 888, 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale in June in Japan through carriers NTT Docomo and SoftBank. Pricing isn’t yet available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy director’s Paralympics RPG is launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kVqUYWdXIIbeH2IwwvHMsjO8SQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297365/Rie_Ogura.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9sddg"&gt;The first project from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt; director Hajime Tabata’s new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, the first game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307399/pegasus-dream-tour-paralympics-game-hajime-tabata-2020"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’d been radio silence on the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOELvx"&gt;JP Games describes &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; as an “avatar RPG” set in Pegasus City. You can create a character based on a selfie from your phone, and train them in various para-sports. The game features illustrated versions of nine real-world para-athletes who compete in sports like javelin, athletics, and wheelchair basketball. Popular Japanese robot cat mascot Doraemon is also included as a guide to Pegasus City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4bnldgiI3SheBdkRL0Rcz-HbVVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519669/Rie_Ogura.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Badminton player Rie Ogura, who is featured in &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;. The athletes are illustrated by Japanese artist Godtail.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="egel4u"&gt;The teaser trailer doesn’t give too much information away about how &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will actually play, with very brief glimpses at the in-game action. The style and scope of the game appear to have changed quite a bit since its initial announcement, and Tabata suggests the Games’ delay altered the focus of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oISx12"&gt;“The format of &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;, which was originally planned to be a “Para-Sports RPG” was switched to that of an “Avatar RPG” in the wake of the global pandemic and the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Games,” Tabata says in a statement. “This is because I felt that the Tokyo Paralympics, which would be held after the postponement, could allow humanity to overcome their divisions and help bring our spirits together. No matter what the outcome of the Tokyo 2020 Games is, it is my wish that people everywhere will come and receive the positive energy that is abundant inside Pegasus City.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86ux3cd0xlWhOn5KKD3VaV_OHZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519667/PEGASUS_SS_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G8EuoE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will be available for iOS and Android on June 24th. It’s a free download with in-app purchases; JP Games says some of the profits will go to the Agitos Foundation, an organization that helps people with disabilities get involved in sports. Pre-launch registration for the game will open today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft board members thought Gates should step down after affair with employee: WSJ</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bill Gates during 8th International Conference on Agriculture Statistics in New Delhi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5EEKWD5O-9QuOUrplRVrJ_NLLcw=/0x0:5440x3627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297079/1183210456.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Indraneel Chowdhury/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s614Xu"&gt;Some of Microsoft’s board members concluded that Bill Gates should step down last year as an investigation was being conducted into an affair with an employee, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gates ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the board in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says was before the investigation had been completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epJGgK"&gt;The board reportedly hired a law firm in 2019 to investigate the matter following a Microsoft employee alleging in a letter that she had had a sexual relationship with Gates over many years. The employee, who was an engineer at the company, is said to have asked that Melinda French Gates, who was married to Bill at the time, read her letter, though it’s unclear whether that actually happened. Gates and French Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418019/bill-melinda-gates-marriage-separation-charity-foundation"&gt;announced their separation&lt;/a&gt; this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZASch"&gt;“Microsoft received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Bill Gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. “A committee of the Board reviewed the concern, aided by an outside law firm to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation, Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N6vhd8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Board members ‘decided it was no longer suitable’ for Gates to remain a director&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QwQEz4"&gt;A spokesperson for Gates denies that his resignation from the board was related to the investigation. “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” the spokesperson tells the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, adding that his “decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Md1ORp"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, some board members “decided it was no longer suitable” for Gates to remain a director at Microsoft as more information about the matter was revealed, and Gates stepped down before an official decision could be made. Microsoft had earlier that year pledged to improve the way it handled harassment complaints after several women &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295647/microsoft-workers-sexual-harassment-stories-internal-email-chain"&gt;shared dozens of their negative experiences at the company on an internal email chain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8XvEB"&gt;The board also reportedly inquired about Gates’ relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, but “were told the relationship was focused on philanthropy and nothing more.” A &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-gave-bill-gates-advice-on-how-to-end-toxic-marriage-sources-say"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, says Gates met Epstein dozens of times between 2011 and 2014, often seeking counsel about his marriage to French Gates. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; that Gates said he was unhappy in his marriage while in Epstein’s presence “on at least one occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdYDfo"&gt;Gates’ association with Epstein was a source of concern for Melinda French Gates, who hired divorce lawyers soon after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/12/20911488/bill-gates-foundation-jeffrey-epstein-meetings"&gt;reports of the pair’s interactions&lt;/a&gt; became public, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. French Gates is also said to have been unhappy with how Gates handled a sexual harassment complaint against his money manager Michael Larson. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; reports that after the woman who made the claims agreed to a settlement, French Gates called for an independent review of the allegations and the culture at Gates’ investment company. Larson was put on leave but later returned to the job; it’s not known whether the report cleared him.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Green Knight, Wish Dragon, Venom 2, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CaSxAbVzJ3tblaIACu3K3GiUqeQ=/60x0:1469x939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69296162/dev_patel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dev Patel stars as Sir Gawain in The Green Knight | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6ksY8xWCY&amp;amp;ab_channel=A24" target="_blank"&gt;A24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4g5So"&gt;So since &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; isn’t dark enough (honestly give us &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, show writers), I also started watching &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; (HBO Max) and over the weekend watched &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; (fine, gritty anti-heroines are my thing, I guess). &lt;em&gt;Mare&lt;/em&gt; is so far reminding me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Broadchurch&lt;/em&gt;, another not-very-uplifting but great show, and Kate Winslet is going all-in on the accent and the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SRYGK"&gt;But wow what a disappointment&lt;em&gt; The Woman in the Window &lt;/em&gt;was. It has an all-star cast (Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie) and a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, based on AJ Finn’s 2018 novel (which BY THE WAY, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions"&gt;read the bonkers backstory&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; guy). It follows the mostly successful (but sort of irritating) trend of movies based on books about unreliable female narrators who get caught up in criminal activity (&lt;em&gt;Gone Girl, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Girl on the Train). &lt;/em&gt;It even has the bones of the Hitchcock classic &lt;em&gt;Rear Window. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9c2waR"&gt;Maybe it’s just one of those books that doesn’t translate well to the screen, or maybe the &lt;a href="https://theplaylist.net/joe-wright-woman-in-the-window-reshoots-screenings-20210108/"&gt;reshoots&lt;/a&gt; undid too much, but the movie felt like it just couldn’t figure out what it wanted to be; a thriller, a mystery, a story about devastating loss, or something else. And why underuse that great supporting cast?! Unfortunately, I think it was too predictable, and not helped by weird pacing and a twist at the end that was more annoying than surprising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMkyli"&gt;On to this week’s trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FoXynG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sS6ksY8xWCY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d21BFa"&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LOFoQw"&gt;Dev Patel stars as Sir Gawain, one of the Knights of the Round Table from King Arthur lore.  The film is based on the &lt;a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight &lt;/em&gt;but the movie version looks a bit more sinister than I remember. What we see in the trailer hews pretty faithfully to the Middle English poem: The Green Knight challenges Gawain to strike him, provided Gawain will let the Green Knight strike him back in a year and a day. Gawain beheads the Green Knight, who picks up his head and saunters away. See you in a year, buddy! &lt;em&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; is in theaters July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xBH35Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWIRyU5fuzU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AEtx5x"&gt;Wish Dragon &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LnYemR"&gt;I needed something a little cute and funny because this week’s lineup seems kinda gruesome otherwise. &lt;em&gt;The Wish Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is an Aladdin-like tale of a magical being who can grant three wishes, but instead of being bound in a lamp, he’s trapped in a teapot. He’s freed by a young man named Din, who’s searching for his childhood friend Lina. John Cho, Constance Wu, and Jimmy Wong star in &lt;em&gt;The Wish Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/netflix-wish-dragon-trailer-john-cho-constance-wu/"&gt;theaters in China&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and will debut on Netflix June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RLCNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zPlquR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ezfi6FQ8Ds?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DqueHh"&gt;Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4iOXBA"&gt;Tom Hardy returns as Eddie Brock and he seems to have come to an understanding of sorts with the Venom symbiote, who cooks him an absolutely disgusting-looking breakfast and has to be reminded not to eat people. This is another of the many films whose release was delayed by the pandemic. Venom 2 is slated to be in theaters September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iXt8sS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOrXpK-rUaI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VIyJLY"&gt;The Forever Purge &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1EjWmL"&gt;At some point doesn’t the purge run out of people to purge if it is “forever”? It’s quite convenient that most of the baddies wear scary masks so you can easily identify them, I guess? This is the fifth &lt;em&gt;Purge&lt;/em&gt; film, and may be the final one (in which case the “forever” makes more sense). It picks up after &lt;em&gt;The Purge: Election Year&lt;/em&gt; and stars Ana de la Reguera, Josh Lucas, Tenoch Huerta, Leven Rambin, Will Patton, and Cassidy Freeman. &lt;em&gt;The Forever Purge&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters July 2nd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxH4ch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber Jake Paul being investigated for driving on protected Puerto Rico beach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jake Paul v Ben Askren - News Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0LjJVrI44ElJtf4P-T_i4btwDc=/0x579:2530x2266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295915/1309409409.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xzuGg0"&gt;Officials in Puerto Rico are reportedly investigating an incident involving YouTube star Jake Paul, after he was seen in a now-deleted video riding in a vehicle on a beach that’s a nesting area for turtles this time of year, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/15/puerto-rico-investigating-jake-paul-after-viral-video-sparks-turtle-outrage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjg9S9"&gt;“I have ordered an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of two motor vehicles on beaches that are presented to be in Puerto Rico,” secretary of natural and environmental resources Rafael Marchargo said &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; (h/t TMZ). “Some media have published today a video of the influencer Jake Paul in a motor vehicle on the beach, an activity that is prohibited, apart from law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEPAKj"&gt;“Although the video does not establish where or when it was carried out, the DNER reminds citizens that this type of activity is prohibited by law to protect the environment and the species that can nest or live on the beaches. Those who violate the law face fines and other penalties, if applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmp7yx"&gt;The back-and-forth between social media influencers seeking the perfect outdoor photo or video, and environmentalists who fret that the amount of attention isn’t good for the natural world has gone on for years. Some popular tourist spots have tried to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/travel/instagram-geotagging-environment.html"&gt;persuade influencers not to geotag their photos&lt;/a&gt;, lest followers try to recreate their shots and trample fragile ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2QfGd"&gt;That doesn’t appear to be the case with Paul in Puerto Rico; &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;according to TMZ&lt;/a&gt;, Paul wasn’t aware of the nesting turtles and planned to cooperate with authorities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVLfcU"&gt;Paul and his brother Logan, who some media outlets reported may have been in one of the vehicles in the video, are well-known for performing rule-defying stunts in their videos; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841260/logan-paul-youtube-suicide-controversy-carelessness-online-celebrity"&gt;Logan was widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; and later apologized for, a video where he showed the body of a man who had died by suicide. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172657/jake-paul-bird-box-challenge-youtube-blindfold-netflix"&gt;Jake participated in the Bird Box challenge of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, walking around blindfolded for 24 hours while on video, which later prompted &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/16/youtube-bans-dangerous-pranks-after-bird-box-challenge"&gt;YouTube to bar creators&lt;/a&gt; from showing “dangerous challenges and pranks” in their videos. And last year, police in Scottsdale, Arizona &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/04/jake-paul-youtube-riot-looting/"&gt;charged Jake Paul with criminal trespass&lt;/a&gt; and unlawful assembly when he was seen on video at a mall that was looted during a wave of protests over the death of George Floyd. Those charges were later dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wvBCS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="S2IDzm"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22424399/clubhouse-android-app-release-date-news-features"&gt;launching its Android app&lt;/a&gt; a week ago, social audio platform Clubhouse said Sunday it will roll out to more countries in the coming week. The Android app will be available in Brazil, Japan, and Russia on Tuesday, India and Nigeria by Friday, and the “rest of the world” throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Android rollout continues! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Japan, Brazil &amp;amp; Russia coming Tuesday&lt;br&gt;     Nigeria &amp;amp; India on Friday AM&lt;br&gt;  Rest of world throughout the week, and available worldwide by Friday afternoon&lt;/p&gt;— Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1393968237239545856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpc4Ow"&gt;For the first year, Clubhouse was only available on iOS devices. Despite its early limited access Clubhouse grew to 10 million users in its inaugural year, and was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-values-clubhouse-at-4-billionwith-dst-tiger?irclickid=30y0-83Z5xyLRMDwUx0Mo3EtUkBxIu02cSPvSM0&amp;amp;irgwc=1&amp;amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&amp;amp;utm_term=theverge.com"&gt;valued at $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; after a new funding round. Whether it can keep up that momentum remains to be seen, as competitors— Twitter’s Spaces, Discord’s Stage Channels, and other better-known social media platforms—enter the audio market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzBIa8"&gt;Clubhouse remains invite-only and has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LiamODellUK/status/1393968691855953924?s=20"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; for not providing automatic captions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. The platform has lately focused on creators, and recently announced the results of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420644/clubhouse-creator-first-pilot-program-season-audio-social"&gt;an accelerator program&lt;/a&gt; which will fund 50 audio Clubhouse shows. CEO Paul Davison said during the weekly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CH_Townhall/status/1393977750361419782"&gt;Clubhouse town hall&lt;/a&gt; that next on the company’s roadmap are in-room tipping for creators, paid events, and subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
