    <title>Sun probe surprises NASA with incredible photo of Venus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEqWWbbig5vrb1sNAKQ6I2oz5Sk=/0x215:880x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873502/wispr_venus_image__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LTOSXB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20993406/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-wind-magnetic-field"&gt;Parker Solar Probe, NASA’s closest eye on the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, was whizzing by Venus last summer for a gravity assist when it snapped a striking new image of the planet’s mysterious nightside, revealing a surprisingly clear view of the Venusian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHciRz"&gt;The spacecraft, launched in 2018, is in the midst of its seven-year journey to study the Sun from 4 million miles away, the closest any human-made object has gone before. To do this, Parker Solar Probe needs to use the gravity of Venus to help tighten its orbit around the Sun through a series of seven flybys, nudging itself closer to the star with each pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYrf7H"&gt;Those scenic passes are valuable opportunities to catch intriguing shots of Venus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOOW5"&gt;The image taken by Parker Solar Probe’s Wide-field Imager (WISPR) came during its third Venus flyby in July 2020, and scientists were shocked. They expected WISPR to capture Venus’ thick, carbon dioxide-rich clouds that usually obstruct views of the surface. But instead, the camera was able see through the clouds and reveal the dark-tinted shape of Aphrodite Terra, an elevated area of Venus near its equator that scientists say is about 85°F cooler than its surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E5Q6YnazMTOIvfvp5BozaSbR1Mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326870/wispr_venus_annotated.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA / Johns Hopkins APL / Naval Research Laboratory / Guillermo Stenborg and Brendan Gallagher&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An up-close shot of the nightside of Venus taken by the Parker Solar Probe, with key features annotated by NASA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qcZRZJ"&gt;“WISPR effectively captured the thermal emission of the Venusian surface,” Brian Wood, an astrophysicist and WISPR scientist at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/parker-solar-probe-offers-a-stunning-view-of-venus/"&gt;NASA statement&lt;/a&gt;. Wood noted the image was similar to &lt;a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/0116-a-new-look-at-venus-with-akatsuki"&gt;those taken by a Japanese Venus probe&lt;/a&gt; currently analyzing Venus that can capture light at near-infrared wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0Gp6r"&gt;The revelation could mean one of two things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpQ5A3"&gt;WISPR might’ve shown off an unexpected capability for sensing infrared light, which, if true, could unlock a new potential for scientists to study dust circling the Sun. “This surprising observation sent the WISPR team back to the lab to measure the instrument’s sensitivity to infrared light,” Michael Buckley, communications manager at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, wrote in a NASA blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wJbLb"&gt;But if that’s not the case, then the appearance of Aphrodite Terra could mean WISPR discovered a previously unknown opening in the thick Venusian clouds, a “window” revealing portions of the planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzIKSd"&gt;To find out, mission teams scheduled more nightside shots of Venus in its latest flyby last weekend. They plan to release more images and an analysis by late April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDQiBI"&gt;WISPR’s image revealed other fascinating traits of Venus. It detected a glowing rim in the planet’s upper atmosphere that scientists suspect could be “nightglow.” Exclusive to Venus’ nightside, the faint luminescence might be caused by a clash of oxygen and nitrogen atoms that come from the side of the planet exposed to the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOgKBK"&gt;Scientists are still studying the exact cause of the wispy streaks of light darting across the image’s frame, the NASA post said. They could be charged particles called &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/16/17690740/cosmic-rays-universe-theory-science"&gt;cosmic rays&lt;/a&gt;, tiny grains of space dust reflecting sunlight or “particles of material expelled from the spacecraft’s structures after impact with those dust grains.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase reveals $1.2 billion revenue in plans to go public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih_0EjBWKos7gvmIJyLtjPoHPkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873439/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aR84Ui"&gt;Coinbase has &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/59347/coinbase-big-profit-for-2020-ahead-of-milestone-ipo-direct-listing"&gt;publicly filed&lt;/a&gt; paperwork to list its stock on the NASDAQ exchange, a huge step forward in the first major public offering for a cryptocurrency company. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm#i86a9d9b35e45447ea6eb369e5dcf1e6a_1197"&gt;Coinbase’s S-1&lt;/a&gt; was published on Thursday morning, after being confidentially submitted to the SEC in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUxdzX"&gt;In an attached letter to investors, founder Brian Armstrong presented cryptocurrency as an equalizing force in financial markets — and Coinbase as the company at the forefront of that change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="obvCre"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If the world economy ran on a common set of standards... the world would be a more fair and free place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjaIvD"&gt;“The current financial system is rife with high fees, unequal access, and barriers to innovation,” the letter reads. “If the world economy ran on a common set of standards that could not be manipulated by any company or country, the world would be a more fair and free place, and human progress would accelerate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGMNe8"&gt;The filing lays out the company’s finances in unprecedented detail, including a surprisingly profitable 2020 driven by a huge spike in the price of bitcoin. Coinbase brought in $1.2 billion in revenue over the course of the year for a profit of $322 million, the first time the company has turned an annual profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9EW8M"&gt;Coinbase boasted 43 million verified users as of the end of 2020, with 2.8 million users making transactions each month and a total of $90 billion of assets held in trust. All told, the company has handled transactions worth $456 billion over its life span as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHrEF3"&gt;Still, the skyrocketing price of bitcoin also has its drawbacks. The filing acknowledges that the volatility of cryptocurrency prices will be a significant risk for Coinbase going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UDffQ"&gt;“All of our sources of revenue are dependent on crypto assets and the broader cryptoeconomy,” the filing reads. “There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event that the price of crypto assets or the demand for trading crypto assets decline, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZeiK8"&gt;Much of Coinbase’s success has been due to its ongoing focus on complying with financial regulations concerning cryptocurrency. Coinbase was one of the first exchanges to embrace conventional know-your-customer finance rules, despite reluctance from the libertarian corners of the cryptocurrency world. As those regulations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;continue to tighten&lt;/a&gt;, many of Coinbase’s competitors have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16060344/btce-bitcoin-exchange-takedown-mt-gox-theft-law-enforcement"&gt;prosecuted for money laundering&lt;/a&gt;, and the company continues to invest heavily in legal compliance. Kathryn Haun, a former prosecutor who led &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/1/9240989/shaun-bridges-silk-road-guilty-carl-mark-force-dread-pirate-roberts"&gt;the Silk Road task force corruption case&lt;/a&gt;, now sits on Coinbase’s board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FdaZC"&gt;In a nod to the historic nature of the filing, elusive Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto is listed on the S-1 as an interested party alongside lawyers and investors involved in the deal. As a result, a copy of the filing has been sent to Nakamoto’s bitcoin wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India sets stricter rules for social media giants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vwgwrZfUbZLbrAbHbYSMR1KgLJs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873325/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4PK6KR"&gt;India has announced new regulations for social networks and other web services in the country, particularly “significant social media” companies with large user bases, like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UowV5d"&gt;India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1700749"&gt;announced the rules&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;a href="https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2021/feb/doc202122521.pdf"&gt;They require social media companies&lt;/a&gt; to establish a “grievance redressal mechanism” for users, including official “grievance officers” who acknowledge complaints within 24 hours and resolve them within 15 days. Services must also remove nudity and sexually explicit content within 24 hours of a user flagging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sr9Ojb"&gt;“Significant social media intermediaries” face additional responsibilities. These companies must appoint India-based officials that work with law enforcement and publish a monthly report on their moderation activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ATXRbE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Guidelines for Social Media Platforms &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Grievance redressal mechanism should be developed and there should be a Grievance Redressal Officer &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should be registered within 24 hours and disposed in 15 days: Union Minister &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rsprasad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@rsprasad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ResponsibleFreedom?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ResponsibleFreedom&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OTTGuideline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OTTGuideline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8A0DQycQqe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8A0DQycQqe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PIB India (@PIB_India) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PIB_India/status/1364882870876078092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U0pfFF"&gt;“Significant” messaging-focused services must also be ready to identify the “first originator” of a message — a regulation likely aimed at Facebook’s highly popular WhatsApp service. Indian regulators have &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/india-likely-to-force-facebook-whatsapp-to-identify-the-originator-of-messages/"&gt;previously asked WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; to identify the sources of anonymous rumors that have sparked violence, but WhatsApp has argued this would compromise its end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="atree3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Messaging services would have to identify the “first originator” of a message&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqte4K"&gt;The framework also indicates that MEITY can regulate digital media services, including video streaming platforms, and require digital news services to follow the official “norms of journalistic conduct” observed by traditional media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3Lq8g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-whatsapp-and-twitter-face-new-rules-in-india-11614250424?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MEITY head Ravi Shankar Prasad said the rules were meant to make social media companies “more responsible and more accountable” for content on their platforms. American social media companies have struggled to navigate problems with violence, hate speech, and political conflict in India. Facebook’s local policy chief Ankhi Das &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536149/ankhi-das-facebook-india-resigned-quit-bjp-hindu-muslim-conflict"&gt;resigned last year&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from activists, and earlier this month, Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276479/twitter-free-speech-india-protests-government-block-orders"&gt;clashed with MEITY&lt;/a&gt; over an order to block activists who criticized India’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmkFzX"&gt;India has tightened its overall regulation of foreign web companies over the past year. In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html"&gt;it banned TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and other Chinese social apps, citing a threat to “national sovereignty.” TikTok reduced its staff in India last month, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;move characterized as&lt;/a&gt; “essentially withdrawing” from the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music is now available on Google TV and Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEm_Rx2NX7y3F1DiST03L85LKY8=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873307/amazon_music_android_tv.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pei3Ud"&gt;Amazon Music is finally coming to Google’s set-top box operating systems, with a new app rolling out for Google TV (currently just available on the latest Chromecast) and Android TV starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOyfjS"&gt;The app will function similarly to Amazon Music on other devices. Subscribers to Amazon Music Unlimited (which costs $7.99 per month for Prime members or $9.99 per month) will be able to access the full music library, similar to Spotify or Apple Music. Regular Prime Members will get access to a curated list of songs and playlists, while users without any subscriptions will get access to Amazon Music’s ad-supported options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF0zw4"&gt;It’s by no means the first music app on Google’s hardware — in addition to Google’s own offerings, services like Spotify and Tidal also have apps there — but it’s a useful option for anyone subscribing to Amazon’s service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIhMgy"&gt;The rollout of Amazon Music on Google’s smart TV hardware is particularly notable given that Amazon and Google had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices"&gt;previously spent years&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2017 and 2018, feuding over content services for their products. That fight resulted in things like Amazon pulling Prime Video from Google devices and Google pulling YouTube from Amazon hardware. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"&gt;had mostly made up by 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though, when YouTube and Prime Video apps returned to Amazon and Google’s hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu6DFa"&gt;Still, the fact that Google is willing to tolerate a direct competition like Amazon Music (which faces squarely up against YouTube Music) is a good sign that the companies have turned over a new leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwOb7k"&gt;The new Amazon Music app is available today in the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, India, Japan, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Framework Laptop is an upgradable, customizable 13-inch notebook coming this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Framework Laptop angled slightly to the right, seen from above. The screen displays mountains and a valley. On either side are a number of modules." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZsuGqqQPDJ2pGwpxehX2CQXD-0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873261/studio_image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTYY5u"&gt;A San Francisco-based startup called &lt;a href="https://frame.work/"&gt;Framework&lt;/a&gt; has just launched an ambitious project: a thin, lightweight productivity laptop that it claims can be “upgraded, customized, and repaired in ways that no other notebook can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5g2L1"&gt;Framework founder Nirav Patel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company aims to address his long-standing frustrations with consumer technology companies. Patel was one of the original Oculus employees and has worked for Apple as well. During that time, he says he “saw an industry that felt incredibly broken across the board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyx41p"&gt;“As a consumer electronics company, your business model effectively depends on churning out constant tons of hardware and pushing it into channels, and into market, and into consumers’ hands, and then sort of dropping it and letting it exist out there,” Patel explains. “It encourages waste and inefficiency, and ultimately environmental damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7vfwb"&gt;To that end, Patel sees the Framework Laptop as more than a product — he sees it as an ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdVfGc"&gt;The Framework comes with a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 screen, a 1080p 60fps webcam, a 57Wh battery, and a 2.87-pound aluminum chassis. Inside, you’ll get 11th Gen Intel processors, up to 64GB of DDR4 memory, and “4TB or more” of Gen4 NVMe storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzOWjz"&gt;As is the case with all kinds of consumer laptops, buyers can swap out and upgrade various internal parts of the Framework, including the RAM, battery, and storage. The company is trying to bring three additional benefits to the table. The first is that you can also customize and upgrade external components of the chassis, including the keyboard, screen, bezels (which are magnetically attached), and ports (via an expansion card system). If you’re someone who hates dongles and docks, you can select four ports from an assortment that includes the usual suspects (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD, etc). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Kh1In"&gt;The second is that Framework will be selling its own modules in a centralized online marketplace, which is also open to third-party sellers and resellers. The idea is that if your screen cracks or you feel like changing your bezels, you can hop onto Framework’s site to find replacements that are custom-made for your laptop rather than having to search around. Framework’s components are printed with QR codes that, when scanned, will bring you straight to a purchase page for their upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkPQlE"&gt;The third is that in addition to a pre-built Framework system, you can purchase a “DIY” kit of your selected parts, which you can then use to assemble the laptop yourself. The DIY Edition provides some operating system flexibility: you can install “your preferred Linux distribution” on it or your pick of Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user disassembles a Framework Laptop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WC53_XOuvk6Qm97MKZpxl0U9e58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327064/lifestyle_image_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Framework&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="743HPU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I saw an industry that felt incredibly broken across the board.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VlHBeM"&gt;It’s a cogent plan, to be sure. But Framework won’t be able to achieve its upgradable, sustainable future just by announcing an ecosystem — it has to actually create an ecosystem that will last. And whether Framework will continue to manufacture modules for this specific laptop model far into the future, or whether third-party partners will pick up the slack, is certainly a question mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6wMQC"&gt;If you’re any kind of PC enthusiast, you probably know that Framework is far from the first company to try a scheme like this. Intel has given modular computers a shot in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18643379/intel-nuc-compute-element-announcement-modular-upgrade-kiosk-laptop"&gt;to little result&lt;/a&gt; — its Compute Card was a commercial failure, and its modular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Ghost Canyon NUC&lt;/a&gt; (which had hardware partners on board at launch) still has yet to receive any new components. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;Alienware’s original Area-51m&lt;/a&gt; also never received its promised future-proof upgradable parts. Phone makers have tried modular devices as well: Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;Project Ara&lt;/a&gt; smartphone, composed of Lego-style bricks that users could rearrange and swap in and out, didn’t go anywhere. The reality is that hardware is hard to build and modular hardware is even more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Framework Laptop closed, seen from above. On both sides are various modules." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NDC2V5K1M7ZOzbpEdUuZhIv4vs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327217/studio_image_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Framework&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sR9zxA"&gt;Patel, for his part, believes those OEMs weren’t committed enough. “Other companies, they put it out there, and someone internally decided, ‘Eh, we’re going to focus on something else this year,’ and shut down the project,” says Patel. “This is not something we’re dabbling in. It’s not a side project for us that someone thought was interesting. This is the core of our company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxzEg7"&gt;“We are releasing new modules, and upgrades, and accessories, and so on to drive the health of the ecosystem, and we’re going to continue doing that for as long as customers want us to,” Patel adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbQfdE"&gt;Framework will be taking preorders this spring, and the device is expected to ship this summer. Pricing hasn’t yet been announced, though Patel says it will be “comparable to other well-reviewed notebooks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder’s Army of the Dead is a big Vegas heist movie coming to Netflix — with zombies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iz0nKUDsP0gPnmg8bswY-QaHqv4=/0x20:3000x2020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873204/AOTD_081519_20780R5_20__20CC_20__20V2_f.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CLAY ENOS/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8HIzxL"&gt;Netflix’s next big-budget action movie is almost here: &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; from director Zack Snyder sees a squad of mercenaries battling their way into Las Vegas to pull off a massive heist. The catch is it’s set after a zombie apocalypse has ravaged the city, so instead of the usual Vegas barriers of casino security and mob bosses, the crew will have to fight through hordes of the ravenous undead to try to get the score of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ENAji"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t show off much, but we do know that Dave Bautista (&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;) will be leading the the show. Snyder, of course, is no stranger to big action films and zombie movies, in particular, having directed the 2004 remake of &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead &lt;/em&gt;(as well as his long list of superhero blockbusters like &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRpzjFXze5XZTqw2ixBHIl2HA4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328060/AOTD_081519_20780R5_20__20CC_20__20V2_f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Clay Enos / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OyMmy2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, however, is a particularly notable film for Snyder, given that it’s just the second wholly original story for the director — and his first in over a decade since 2011’s &lt;em&gt;Sucker Punch&lt;/em&gt; was released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHBcYf"&gt;Netflix is also betting big on &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; kicking off a new franchise for the streaming site: in addition to the main film from Snyder, the company also is producing &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead: The Prequel&lt;/em&gt;, a German-American co-production directed and starring Matthias Schweighöfer (who’ll also appear in Snyder’s film.) There’s also an anime-style TV series planned, &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas&lt;/em&gt;, which will see several of the characters from the main film reprise their roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfXafK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; will debut on Netflix on May 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Post Malone cover Hootie &amp; the Blowfish for Pokémon’s 25th anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVQY8CH5_FkpyldUdIlTkSaTYS4=/0x51:960x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873199/Post_Malone_x_Pokemon_Publicity_Photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1eL7JI"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;Post Malone will hold a virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;the 25th anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt;. If that combination wasn’t strange enough, today, he revealed one of the songs he’ll be performing: a cover of Hootie &amp;amp; the Blowfish’s mid-’90s hit “Only Wanna Be With You.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi8rVr"&gt;I’m not entirely sure how much crossover there is between Post, Hootie, and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; fans, but the song is definitely a real thing. You can listen to the cover in the video above, and The Pokémon Company says “the song will be included as part of Post’s headlining appearance” at the virtual concert, which will be airing on February 27th at 7PM ET. You can watch the live stream on both Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOXpBQ"&gt;Elsewhere, it also looks like we may be getting some big news from the franchise. On February 26th at 10AM ET, The Pokémon Company will host an event on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pokemon"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, which promises “approximately 20 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; news.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First trailer for Pixar’s Luca follows two sea monster best friends trying to enjoy a summer in Italy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ji2T9KcRVTfoixTbJlARos-XUlA=/215x0:1298x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873070/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_9.29.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwYTTx"&gt;Trying to find friends can be stressful on its own, but when you’re a sea monster trying to blend in with the residents of an Italian town who just so happen to hate sea monsters, it’s even more anxiety-inducing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weimXu"&gt;This is the basic premise of &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;Pixar’s new animated film&lt;/a&gt; coming later this year. The movie follows Luca Paguro, a 13-year-old sea monster who wants to see what life is like above the sea, and his friend Alberto Scorfano, who loves the human world. Together, they take on human-looking forms and explore around an Italian town, trying to live a carefree life and enjoy the simple things that humans may take for granted, like bicycles and gelato. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbleHh"&gt;If that sounds a little like &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;, one of Disney’s most popular animated films, you’re not alone. Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Luca &lt;/em&gt;is likely going to become a story about love, friendship, and acceptance — themes often prevalent in Pixar and Disney films. Directed by Enrico Casarosa (&lt;em&gt;La Luna&lt;/em&gt;) and produced by Andrea Warren (&lt;em&gt;Cars 3, Lava&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Luca &lt;/em&gt;stars Jacob Tremblay (&lt;em&gt;Room&lt;/em&gt;) as Luca and Jack Dylan Grazer (&lt;em&gt;It&lt;/em&gt;) as Alberto. Emma Berman, Maya Rudolph, Jim Gaffigan, and Marco Barricelli round out the voice acting cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7sz9h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luca &lt;/em&gt;does not have a release date right now, but it’s scheduled for this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV’s touchpad swipes and misses at being a good remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SabX-zpnBqRdZwClYeBz2FzeBXs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873060/akrales_210224_4406_0066.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLMbFe"&gt;It’s rare to find a button that is almost universally hated, but the infamous touchpad on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9630952/new-apple-tv-4-review"&gt;Apple TV’s Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; might be the exception. Even over half a decade after its introduction, it stands as one of the most reviled pieces of hardware around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwJD7m"&gt;The failings of the Apple TV remote don’t just stem from a bad touchpad (and don’t get me wrong: it is bad) but from a larger misunderstanding on Apple’s part of what makes a good remote and the fundamental purpose of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvoWpW"&gt;The typical TV remote is big and ugly, but it’s also extremely easy to find and navigate thanks to differing patterns of buttons that make it clear what you’re touching even without checking. Generally speaking, no one has ever been too confused about how to find the giant rubber rocker that says “VOLUME” or what the huge, often glowing red power button does. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLS6K3kwl5u3N2_vz0zI62VUd8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326742/akrales_210224_4406_0053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bcDXgq"&gt;Apple’s remotes have always been far simpler and smaller, but its older models still had distinct buttons for key features like navigation and controlling playback. And crucially, you could tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LfLoF"&gt;But the so-called Siri Remote broke from those designs when it was introduced alongside the fourth-generation Apple TV in 2015. The new Apple TV featured the biggest revamp of Apple’s set-top box ambitions to date, introducing its tvOS platform, an App Store, and the goal of becoming a one-stop shop for all your TV needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fVaRDb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS-style apps meant an iOS-style control scheme&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zzKoxi"&gt;The remote was designed to complement those ambitions. Most notably, the directional pad was removed and replaced with a featureless touchpad that was meant to more closely emulate the touchscreens found on iPhones and iPads. After all, the Apple TV could run iOS-style apps now, so presumably it needed an iOS-style control scheme to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3Kd2R"&gt;But in its pursuit of emulating the smartphone experience, Apple lost sight of the key elements of a good TV remote. The Siri Remote’s slimmed-down glass and aluminum design looked fantastic. In practice, though, the diminutive remote was even easier to lose than its already small predecessors, with a design that seems to be tailor-made for slipping between couch seats and underneath cushions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DBLrvP6y_4MlyyGfb7NPrHMZ8iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326745/akrales_210224_4406_0094.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nF9oVk"&gt;The minimalist design stripped the remote down to just just a few buttons, but the virtually symmetrical layout made it nearly impossible to distinguish between those buttons in the dark (say, when watching a movie). Pick up the remote the wrong way, and instead of hitting the play / pause button to stop your show, you might hit the TV button — which boots you out of the show and takes you to Apple’s overstuffed TV app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKfXK2"&gt;Add in software updates that have changed what those buttons actually do (the TV button used to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tv-remote-home-button-changed-by-apple-2019-9#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20pressing%20the%20%22TV,rest%20of%20your%20apps%20live."&gt;work as a home button&lt;/a&gt; until Apple released the TV app in 2019), and it’s another indictment of the remote’s chase of form over function. Even Apple seems to be aware of this: when it refreshed the Siri remote for the fifth-generation Apple TV 4K, it added a white ring to the menu button to make it slightly easier to tell which side is up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvqEWo"&gt;And then there’s the touchpad. With only its matte texture serving to distinguish it from the glossy grip of the remote, it suffers from the same orientation issues as the other buttons. Pick up the remote the wrong way, and you’ll either end up swiping on useless glass when you meant to move around the OS or flinging your way through a show when you meant to just grab the remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wrMjWx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The touchpad is just plain bad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKPeVA"&gt;Even if you can orient it the right way, the overly sensitive and opaque nature of the touchpad makes it easy to overshoot whatever it was you were trying to do in the first place. In theory, the touchpad is a useful tool for playing games, swiping through pages of apps, and effortlessly panning through a Netflix show. In practice, it’s terrible at nearly all of those tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPEDhE"&gt;The remote is such a problem that when Swiss TV and internet provider Salt started offering Apple TVs as set-top boxes, it worked with Apple to make a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;simpler, more traditional remote control&lt;/a&gt; to offer customers instead. One of the biggest changes is a swap from the touchpad to a regular, rubber D-pad. The touchpad promises limitless functionality, but it’s so hard to use that a &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; versatile input method is actually more useful. (The $20 Salt remotes routinely sell on eBay for nearly triple their value to disgruntled customers in other markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPb0i-Ad_mYulNmI0GmqC4rG5XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326746/akrales_210224_4406_0105.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1BJpAo"&gt;But for all those issues, the Siri Remote’s failures all stem from a common cause: the smartphone-ification of the traditional TV remote. The svelte design and touchpad interface are things that helped skyrocket the original iPhone to its massive success. But for a TV remote — a device that needs to be easily found in a sea of throw pillows and function simply without requiring that you tear your eyes away from the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; — they’re precisely the wrong traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UB7f1H"&gt;Apple made a remote control that’s an undeniably beautiful piece of hardware. Outside of the Siri Remote, how many TV remotes can claim to actually look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;? But the touchpad’s minimalism and misplaced attempt at trying to turn the entire remote into something that it’s not makes it like other failed Apple buttons before it: a stark warning of the dangers of chasing form over function. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to buy Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_xC0e_-R_mHspcZBFq1U1sCY88=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873032/shollister_200224_4441_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;EVGA’s RTX 3060 graphics card | Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kfxa6U"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3060 will be available to purchase starting on Thursday, February 25th at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Unlike other GPUs in the RTX 30 series, Nvidia is not making a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060, but other manufacturers like EVGA and Gigabyte are making their own iterations of the RTX 3060. The price is said to be $329, but as has been the case for the past year, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to find it available for that. Retailers that have posted listings are already marking up 3060 cards to $390 or more, which is much closer in price to the step-up 3060 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbzG6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22064700"&gt;reviewed EVGA’s iteration of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that although the GPU’s price makes it more competitive to buy, you’re sacrificing more than a little bit of performance compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21768294/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-when-where-how-to-buy-gpu"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LG09Kn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10360060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aSEuLX"&gt;So far, Best Buy and Micro Center are the only retailers that have put listings up for the RTX 3060. We will continue to update the list of cards and retailers selling them as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
