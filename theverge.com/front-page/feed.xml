    <title>Pakistan is again banning TikTok, this time for ‘peddling vulgarity’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufLIkvf3ZyakkULTvro5-1pWqgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951763/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hGrOzk"&gt;Pakistan has banned TikTok yet again, citing objectionable content on the shortform video app. This is the second time the ByteDance platform has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509817/tiktok-pakistan-ban-immoral-indecent-content"&gt;banned in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, following a brief 10-day shutdown in October of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONMcK"&gt;Last fall, TikTok was banned for hosting “immoral” and “indecent” videos, but the company was able to assure the Pakistani government that videos would be moderated “in accordance with societal norms and the laws of Pakistan,” and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523094/pakistan-tiktok-ban-lifted-after-10-days"&gt;resumed operations&lt;/a&gt; a week and a half later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kgMTQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App. During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.&lt;/p&gt;— PTA (@PTAofficialpk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4pyxu"&gt;The company has tens of millions of users in Pakistan, and yet a high court in the city of Peshawar ordered the government’s telecom regulatory body, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, to ban the app in order to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOV0rz"&gt;“In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App,” reads the announcement. “During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnTr1J"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why TikTok’s legality in Pakistan is again in question and whether any one video or trend on the app is the culprit. Yet, &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/11/pakistani-court-orders-tik-tok-banned-over-obscene"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that complaints were made from Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan, who accused TikTok of hosting content “unacceptable for Pakistani society.” &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/90df50e4-7fd9-4def-86e3-db256882140d"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khan said the platform engaged in “peddling vulgarity” and ordered the ban take effect immediately during a hearing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1gtY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second ban for TikTok in Pakistani in the last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9vyZs6"&gt;“TikTok is built upon the foundation of creative expression, with strong safeguards in place to keep inappropriate content off the platform,” TikTok said in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt;. “In Pakistan we have grown our local-language moderation team, and have mechanisms to report and remove content in violation of our community guidelines. We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wCZ8I"&gt;TikTok has endured a number of contentious government bans and other restrictions around the world — most notably, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;countrywide ban in India since last summer&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;hamfisted attempt&lt;/a&gt; to force the company to partner with a US tech firm to assuage fears of Chinese government influence over the platform. (That deal, with cloud giant Oracle, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;apparently on life support&lt;/a&gt; under President Joe Biden.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OJcgI"&gt;The app has faced its most serious opposition in and around Southeast Asia, where governments have extended existing control over the media to the video-centric social network using laws and regulations around what constitutes obscene or immoral content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gogo’s 5G network launch has stalled due to the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gogo in-flight internet STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHETWhF_mED3GtwchqDhx2yO6nE=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951586/gogo-internet-logo-stock1_1020.1419980305.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Gogo in-flight internet STOCK&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t5p29N"&gt;Gogo will be delaying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18644707/gogo-5g-network-planes-developing-in-flight"&gt;the rollout of its 5G network&lt;/a&gt;, pushing it back from 2021 to 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/gogo-delays-5g-launch-due-to-chipset-shortages/d/d-id/768025"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;LightReading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the global chip shortage is to blame for the delay, though Gogo didn’t provide any direct details about how the shortage was setting it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZONve"&gt;Gogo isn’t the only one feeling the sting of the global chip shortage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, CPUs, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;game consoles&lt;/a&gt; have become infamous for being in short supply, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;car manufacturers are having to slow down production lines&lt;/a&gt; because of the supply constraint. The situation has gotten to the point where President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;has signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling for a review of the chip supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBl0iq"&gt;The company, known for providing in-flight Wi-Fi, had a difficult 2020: it did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350251/gogo-layoffs-furloughs-airlines-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;several rounds of layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, pay cuts, and furloughs, as people stopped taking flights. The company also ended up selling its commercial in-flight Wi-Fi business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410368/gogo-sells-inflight-internet-business-intelsat-bankrupt"&gt;to a bankrupt satellite provider&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it slightly unclear as to what the company plans to do with its 5G network when it eventually gets it rolled out. The company &lt;a href="https://business.gogoair.com/solutions/midsize-heavy-jet/"&gt;still provides internet and in-flight entertainment&lt;/a&gt; for smaller, more business-oriented planes, so it’s possible it’ll use the network to improve that service. Gogo wasn’t immediately available to comment on its future plans for the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ3w42"&gt;The 5G network, when Gogo gets it rolled out, will be &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/gogo-goes-all-american-for-5g-network/d/d-id/755064"&gt;an upgrade to the company’s existing 3G cellular towers&lt;/a&gt;. Gogo gave up on its plans of upgrading the network to 4G with equipment from ZTE after the US government basically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17477170/zte-ban-senate-vote-reinstate"&gt;shut down the network equipment provider with a ban&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Game Boy Advance might be the best way to watch Tenet, actually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16DYdN1siI2AgwHGsj1F-hmm-N8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951371/tenetgba.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/1370042833608994817/photo/2" target="_blank"&gt;Bob Wulff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uen3aT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, the latest film by director Christopher Nolan, arrived on Blu-ray in December 2020, but now it has been released in another physical format: Game Boy Advance cartridges. Via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenet-game-boy-advance-bob-wulff-christopher-nolan-202848161.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4od1AdB8e4"&gt;YouTuber Bob Wulff&lt;/a&gt; managed to fit the two-hour, 30-minute time-bending film with a nearly incomprehensible plot on five cartridges, compressed down to a 192 x 128 resolution that looks blurry even on the GBA’s 240 x 160 display. The worst (best) part of the experience might be that it runs at six frames per second. They even made bespoke labels for each cartridge that are, actually, very well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRRdlu"&gt;Now, before you ask aloud “why?” just say “thank you, Bob Wulff!” instead. This obviously doesn’t need to exist, but the promise of these little displays of technical prowess applied in strange, delightful ways is what gets me out of bed each morning. Plus, it’s fun to imagine Christopher Nolan realizing that there’s a fate far worse than streaming services for his IMAX films to end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqWEFh"&gt;You can watch the video above to see how they did this. But, you know what? Why watch YouTube videos on &lt;em&gt;YouTube&lt;/em&gt;? That’s passé. Wulff turned the video above &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/1370047156938227722"&gt;into a ROM download&lt;/a&gt; that you can load into a GBA emulator, like mGBA, to name one of many examples you can get on a Windows PC. Come on, you know you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAIvML"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile plans to turn up 5G speed this year, cover 90 percent of Americans with fast 5G by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1ALIQN-zGC7S5F5hxvsqxiV0yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951303/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile is keen to stay ahead of the 5G competition | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5066wz"&gt;During its &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/T-Mobile-Virtual-Analyst-Day/default.aspx"&gt;virtual analyst event&lt;/a&gt; today, T-Mobile outlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1370098384816779265?s=20"&gt;some bold plans&lt;/a&gt; for expanding its 5G coverage and speeding up its current offerings. The company says that by the end of 2023, it will cover 90 percent of Americans (about 300 million) with what it calls Ultra Capacity 5G (its faster mid-band and mmWave service). It also plans to cover 97 percent of Americans (approximately 320 million) by the end of 2022 with its slower low-band 5G, which it calls Extended Range. Currently, 125 million are covered by Ultra Capacity, with Extended Range covering 287 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHYsUO"&gt;Additionally, those currently covered by Ultra Capacity 5G will see an increase in average speeds from 300Mbps up to 400Mbps, thanks to additional megahertz devoted to 5G, and T-Mobile says that more speed increases are on the way. This portion of T-Mobile’s 5G service is largely based on spectrum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquired from its Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;, with mid-band frequencies well-suited to faster speeds and broad coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sfFCloG7qNYmJkL-vz7n6C2PeQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363649/slack_imgs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s C-band acquisition figures into expansion plans starting in 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S1S5xW"&gt;Already having access to those mid-band frequencies allowed T-Mobile to take a less aggressive approach to the recent FCC C-band auction, a fact it celebrated throughout its investor call today. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobile-further-solidifies-5g-leadership-position-with-successful-c-band-auction&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325857%2Ft-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile says its comparatively low bid&lt;/a&gt; of $9.3 billion (Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bid $45.4 and $23.4 million, respectively) went toward spectrum that would strategically supplement its current 2.5GHz holdings. Those frequencies will become available in 2023 and likely figure into the latter part of the company’s aggressive expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this: the fight over YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news site — and a cat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iUQYcKGO6KPnBCX2eosNnoMiyPM=/0x9:3918x2621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951186/Screen_Shot_2021_03_11_at_12.38.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SCNR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SqUIW"&gt;YouTube drama remains some of the most interesting drama, and &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on infighting at political YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news company — and the fate of a cat named Betsy — is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uccKyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;’s Will Sommer sets the scene with Pool’s background as a former &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reporter who went independent as an alt-right-adjacent YouTube creator. But the meat of the report is the fight over Subverse, a news media &lt;a href="https://scnr.com/"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SCNRtv/featured"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; (renamed SCNR for a hilarious reason you should read the report to learn) for which Pool and his former business partner, Emily Molli, raised over $1 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBaUre"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7URS4gFQFGw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0vV4A"&gt;Molli was joined by another &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;alum, Rocco Castoro, to get the YouTube operation off the ground, and the resulting videos feel a lot like &lt;em&gt;Vice’s &lt;/em&gt;own documentary work. But then problems arose. “Tensions between Pool and his other partners flared...over who had access to various internal systems connected to Subverse,” writes Sommer. Those tensions would lead to Castoro and Molli investigating Pool for “unsavory internet schemes” and leave Betsy, Molli’s cat, allegedly held hostage at Pool’s mansion in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObTlei"&gt;You should read &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;Sommer’s report on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the complicated journey Betsy took to get back to Molli. But for now, remember: never let your cat go to a second location with a YouTube creator / podcaster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sues 11-year veteran MacBook designer for allegedly stealing trade secrets for a journalist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fA86QY2DKSwH07ZT7beT5FHyO3Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950940/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8u8rBK"&gt;Apple is suing Simon Lancaster, a former product design architect at the company, accusing him of selling trade secrets and details on unreleased Apple products to an unnamed media correspondent. Lancaster apparently did this in hopes of gaining publicity for his next venture after leaving Apple. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/11/apple-sues-former-employee-over-device-leaks-to-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported on the legal filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03nWQN"&gt;“Tens of thousands of Apple employees work tirelessly every day on new products, services and features in the hopes of delighting our customers and empowering them to change the world. Stealing ideas and confidential information undermines their efforts, hurting Apple and our customers,” commented Apple in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We take very seriously this individual’s deliberate theft of our trade secrets, violation of our ethics and our policies, all for personal gain. We will do all we can to protect the innovations we hold so dear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbXqLk"&gt;According to Apple’s suit, Lancaster and his correspondent began communicating in 2018 about the possibility of obtaining information; the two then spent the next year in communication. Lancaster then reportedly contacted his correspondent in spring 2019, asking him to investigate rumors of a potential Apple product that could “mean trouble for my startup.” The lawsuit also claims that Lancaster boasted to a third party shortly after that conversation that his media contact would be writing a story on his startup if it hit $1 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpnIE4"&gt;In October 2019, Lancaster reportedly notified his correspondent that he was planning to leave Apple, giving over secret information on Apple products and asking if they wanted “to write a story about a 12-year Apple Design Veteran leaving for an amazing startup?” The correspondent also allegedly asked Lancaster to get additional information on an unannounced project that Apple refers to as “Project X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0Uz1"&gt;Lancaster then submitted his notice of resignation to Apple on October 15th, but kept chatting with his media source — the next day, they allegedly asked for specific documents they wanted Lancaster to get before he left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDRJhH"&gt;Apple also alleges that Lancaster specifically attended a meeting about “Project X” even after he had submitted his resignation notice, specifically to get more information to pass along to his media contact, despite the fact that he had been instructed by other employees not to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSZRmH"&gt;The company also claims that Lancaster used his Apple credentials to download confidential information almost up until his employment ended at midnight on November 1st, 2019. According to Apple, Lancaster logged in from an external location at 10:24PM that day — this time, to get materials that the company says would help his new employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARMU4S"&gt;Lancaster &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started working at Apple in 2008&lt;/a&gt; and spent 11 years working at the company, serving as advanced materials lead and product design architect in his final role there &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;before leaving in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to join Arris Composites, a material design company, as its head of consumer products. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191122005108/en/Simon-Lancaster-Former-Advanced-Materials-Lead-at-Apple-Joins-Arris-Composites-to-Unlock-Future-of-Consumer-Products"&gt;According to a press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing his switch to Arris, Lancaster worked on the 13-inch and 15-inch Macbook Pro with Touch Bar redesigns, along with “unreleased Apple products.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is trying to crack down on password sharing with new test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0cklrAZ9soHWrQX2XLAoqQy9P8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950935/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8NpwLQ"&gt;Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;more than 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; around the world, and now the company is looking at ways to curb password sharing for both business and security reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMuTOM"&gt;A new feature, &lt;a href="https://gammawire.com/netflix-to-start-testing-warnings-for-people-borrowing-login-info/"&gt;first spotted by &lt;em&gt;GammaWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, prevents people who are not authorized to use the account from accessing it. A Netflix spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so.” If Netflix detects that someone is trying to use the account without being an account owner, they’ll be asked to verify later or verify being an account owner through an email code or text code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jWSpB"&gt;If someone is unable to verify account ownership within a certain timeframe, they won’t be able to stream any Netflix content. Instead, they’ll be asked to make their own account. While this may not prevent all password sharing — hypothetically, an account owner could send their friend the code as it comes through — the idea is that it will prevent some password sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2cglF"&gt;The test, which isn’t specific to any one country for any specific length of time, is also being rolled out to try to better security measures around account protection. If there’s a malicious attempt to use an account for which someone may have gained a password through fraudulent methods, they won’t be able to access the account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLEisr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kZNYqc"&gt;One of the biggest questions Netflix subscribers might have is what constitutes a household account. Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/termsofuse"&gt;terms of service state&lt;/a&gt; that streaming content on the platform is “for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household.” That may mean a physical household, but the terms of service aren’t super clear. Families with kids away at college or living in different states may sign up for the family plan, for example. That’s one scenario that co-CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/17/your-shared-netflix-password-is-safe-the-ceo-says.html"&gt;specifically spoke about in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="844ppc"&gt;“Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with,” Hastings said. “There’s so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids, so there’s no bright line, and we’re doing fine as is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxsF9"&gt;Now, however, it seems like Netflix’s teams are trying to figure out a way to combat some password sharing while also addressing tighter security measures. Password sharing has long been a concern posed by analysts and investors in the space. Analysis from Parks Associates estimated that password sharing and piracy cost companies in the &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/01/13/password-sharing-denies-streaming-services-9-billion-in-fees-report/"&gt;streaming space around $9 billion alone&lt;/a&gt;. While Hastings alongside other entertainment executives have shrugged it off as something that companies have to contend with, it appears that things are beginning to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJCKtS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox boss says Microsoft’s Bethesda deal was all about exclusive games for Game Pass</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Phil Spencer Microsoft Xbox stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hnzpEiGjOyKwGYStemd93xv-p0U=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950635/philspencer2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YqpkAT"&gt;Microsoft completed its $7.5 billion Bethesda acquisition earlier this week and initially hinted that “some new titles in the future” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;would be exclusive to Xbox and PC players&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;language left some wiggle room for the possibility of future Bethesda titles to appear on Sony’s PlayStation 5, Nintendo’s Switch, or elsewhere. Now, Microsoft’s Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, is making it very clear why the company paid $7.5 billion for Bethesda: Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0iTHt"&gt;Speaking during a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YJneU_qBMPM"&gt;Bethesda and Xbox roundtable&lt;/a&gt; event today, Spencer revealed that Xbox Game Pass is at the heart of this Bethesda deal. “If you’re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists,” said Spencer. “That’s our goal, that’s why we’re doing this, that’s the root of this partnership that we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0YAlh"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;not a surprising admission&lt;/a&gt;, as it has been obvious Microsoft has been gearing up for a different kind of Xbox future with its Xbox Game Pass subscription push. But hearing it directly from the head of Xbox makes it even clearer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen Xbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="prYfiL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox chief Phil Spencer on exclusive Bethesda games: "This is about delivering great exclusive games for you [Xbox customers] that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists." &lt;a href="https://t.co/K1U84pukdu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K1U84pukdu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1370079409118588931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQQd5o"&gt;This doesn’t mean Bethesda games will suddenly disappear from other platforms. In fact, it’s the opposite. “There’s contractual obligations that we’re going to see through, as we always do in every one of these instances,” says Spencer. “We have games that exist on other platforms, and we’re gonna go support those games on the platforms they’re on. There’s communities of players and we love those communities and we’ll continue to invest in them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IY8TT"&gt;Microsoft and Bethesda only cleared the deal recently, so it’s too early for any game announcements, but questions remain over Bethesda’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447792/bethesda-starfield-new-series-announced-e3-2018"&gt;new and upcoming &lt;em&gt;Starfield &lt;/em&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226966/bethesda-indiana-jones-game-machinegames"&gt;recently announced Indiana Jones game&lt;/a&gt;. Will these both be exclusive to Xbox and PC? We simply don’t know yet. Spencer did mention that “even in the future there might be things that have contractual things, or legacy on different platforms that we’ll go do,” so there &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;potentially be new Bethesda games appearing on non-Microsoft platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWLVmu"&gt;What’s clear is that the long-term goal is for Bethesda to create exclusive games that will only be available on platforms where Xbox Game Pass is supported. At the moment, that’s Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, Android phones, and soon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;iOS devices via the web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptC6Gj"&gt;Here’s Spencer’s full statement on Bethesda exclusivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cyvpZP"&gt;So obviously I can’t sit here and say every Bethesda game is exclusive, because we know that’s not true. There’s contractual obligations that we’re going to see through, as we always do in every one of these instances. We have games that exist on other platforms, and we’re gonna go support those games on the platforms they’re on. There’s communities of players and we love those communities and we’ll continue to invest in them. And even in the future there might be things that have contractual things, or legacy on different platforms that we’ll go do. But if you’re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists. That’s our goal, that’s why we’re doing this, that’s the root of this partnership that we’re building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft will share information about drivers deactivated for serious offenses </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-RIDESHARE-DEMONSTRATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGCr_vp9ZwO7ON4KfWR1hNDXqlY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950317/1227939563.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jwyVWq"&gt;Uber and Lyft announced a “first-of-its-kind” effort to share information about drivers who were deactivated for committing serious offenses, including physical and sexual assault and murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVdi8d"&gt;Uber and Lyft will pool information under the banner of the Industry Safety Sharing Project, which will be administered by a third party. The companies will share “information about driver deactivations related to the five most critical safety issues within the &lt;a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsvrc.org%2Fhelping-industries-classify-reports&amp;amp;esheet=52394819&amp;amp;newsitemid=20210311005782&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=National+Sexual+Violence+Resource+Center%26%238217%3Bs+%28NSVRC%29+Sexual+Misconduct+and+Sexual+Violence+Taxonomy&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=df5e155eacf5eea90fe219afc727eef0"&gt;National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s (NSVRC) Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Violence Taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;, along with physical assault fatalities,” Uber and Lyft said in a joint announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RlUnw0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ride-hailing services have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKWslM"&gt;Ride-hailing services have long struggled to keep riders and drivers safe from one another. In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt;first safety report&lt;/a&gt;, Uber disclosed that 3,045 sexual assaults occurred on Uber trips in 2018. Additionally, nine people were murdered during Uber rides, and 58 people died in auto-related crashes. Interestingly, Uber said that drivers reported being victims of assaults at roughly the same rate as riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7poCz"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/30/technology/uber-driver-sexual-assault/index.html"&gt;2018 CNN report&lt;/a&gt; found that at least 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse. Also in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html"&gt;19 women sued Lyft&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to prevent sexual assault perpetrated by drivers on the platform and for doing little to investigate the complaints. A California woman who says she was raped by a Lyft driver in 2017 also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870765/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit-alison-turkos-safety-complaints"&gt;sued the company in September&lt;/a&gt; over failing to keep riders safe, while 14 additional women &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit/index.html"&gt;sued Lyft earlier in September&lt;/a&gt; over its handling of sexual assault complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMvGFt"&gt;Both companies conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority. They also have largely attempted to tackle this issue through technology updates, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us"&gt;in-app “panic buttons,”&lt;/a&gt; which let riders instantly dial 911, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143679/uber-rider-reporting-safety-issue-driver-trip"&gt;ways to report a driver for unsafe activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aENuF5"&gt;This new project is the first time the two companies have collaborated to share information about drivers who have been accused of the most serious offenses. Drivers are classified as independent contractors, not employees, meaning they can — and frequently do — drive for both companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HUi63"&gt;The companies will share information about drivers that commit a serious offense as defined by the NSVRC categories. Once that information is shared, the decision to ban a driver is up to the other company based on its policies and standards. Each company can decide to take action to deactivate that driver, a spokesperson for Uber said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbbzdJ"&gt;In addition, drivers and couriers who are being onboarded to either company will undergo a check against this database to verify if their name matches against any deactivations previously shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2VrE8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One year later</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;To brighter days ahead &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="94mVmU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22167586/pandemic-time-perception-2020-covid"&gt;The calendar&lt;/a&gt; tells me that it’s been a year since the world changed. It’s been more than a year, really: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075647/us-wuhan-coronavirus-case-china-deaths-virus-illness"&gt;the first COVID-19 case&lt;/a&gt; in the United States was reported on January 21st, 2020. The emergency was invisibly building in the US even before that. But a year ago today, the scale of the threat was pushed into view, and the outbreak became a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="Xxd8jq"&gt;It’s hard to recapture the specific feelings of last March. There was a particular mixture of confusion, fear, numbness, and denial hanging in the background of everything, and most of the month was a blur. But within that miasma of badness, specific moments stand out. Those vivid signposts are the things I remember most clearly when I think back to a year ago: a de-stressing collage I made from old magazines, a miniature bottle of hand sanitizer, a specific trip to the bagel shop, the things I panic-bought on Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="lA7XEM"&gt;Everyone has their own unique markers of the days when things changed. I asked &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff to share theirs. Luckily, there are brighter days ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xCj4Qt"&gt;
&lt;p id="oPNJjD"&gt;My favorite relic of the first weeks of the pandemic is the 76.5-ounce canister of lemon-lime Gatorade powder I bought on Amazon. Everything was so scary and so new, and my instinct was to get everything I might need if I (or someone I knew) got sick. Enough powder to make nine gallons of Gatorade seemed reasonable at the time. I’ve used around half of it in the past year; it was particularly useful during election week when I was too anxious for solid food. Now, the canister lives on the top of my fridge, and I’m very attached to it. It feels like the strangest-possible pandemic security blanket.  —&lt;em&gt;Nicole Wetsman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WQLEz8"&gt;When masks first became a thing, disposable masks weren’t available because they were needed by first responders and hospital workers. I remember being grateful that I already had a couple of reusable face masks leftover from when we had to have some exterminators come the year before. But I didn’t know if those two would last, and you couldn’t find any to buy, so I did some research, asked some of the other Verge folks what they were doing, and hand-sewed a rather neat little mask from an old bedsheet (which I ended up never actually using). I remember several friends with sewing machines were sewing face masks to send to hospitals because the demand was so huge that medical personnel were running short, and cloth masks were better than none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeaD5"&gt;The other hard-to-get pandemic item was hand sanitizer. Again, it was simply not available, and I researched what you had to use to make your own, including what kind of alcohol and what strength it had to be. (I actually ended up writing an article about it.) I managed to score the aloe vera gel I needed at a local health food store but was never able to get the alcohol at the strength demanded — by the time it was available, I was able to purchase hand sanitizer at my local supermarket anyway. There must be something I can do with that aloe vera gel… &lt;em&gt;—Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mDNJSh"&gt;
&lt;p id="klo8LR"&gt;I made a panicked trip to the grocery store about the same time as everyone else in Seattle when we realized what was going on. It was chaos — so many confused people, none of us sure what we were supposed to be doing or buying. All of the good brands of oat milk were cleared off the shelves. I put two frozen pizzas on the bottom of my shopping cart. I remember a sense of comfort, like, “Yes, this additional frozen pizza will see us through the deadly pandemic.” When I got to the front of the massive checkout line, there was only one pizza — the other one fell off at some point. RIP that other frozen pizza, abandoned on the floor of a Safeway in March 2020. You were sorely missed.  &lt;em&gt;—Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SYcr5f"&gt;New York City, as everyone knows, was one of the first hotspots for COVID-19 in the US. The early stages of the pandemic were all about trying to convey our experience, and the importance of believing science and taking precautions, to family members who weren’t impacted yet in other parts of the country. It was — and continues to be — an incredibly frustrating experience trying to relay info to loved ones who still hold on to the “it couldn’t happen to me” line of thinking. I’m so glad it hasn’t happened to them, but it so easily could have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0BMww"&gt;Oh, and it was really hard to find toilet paper there for a while. Bidet all day.  &lt;em&gt;—Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Bj76M7"&gt;
&lt;p id="kWpXnZ"&gt;Two days stand out for when the pandemic became “real” to me. On February 29th, one day after the &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/ERD/Pages/Oregon-First-Presumptive-Case-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx"&gt;first reported case of COVID-19 in Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, I woke up and asked my wife if we should buy extra food at the grocery store. I wondered if that would be a weird or over-reactionary thing to do. (Who knew that I should have actually been asking about buying extra toilet paper.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlyczH"&gt;On March 11th, there was the weird double-whammy of the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/11/21176029/nba-coronavirus-canceled-utah-jazz-espn-brian-windhorst-recode-media"&gt;NBA cancelling its season&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9nVasnBNF5/?hl=en"&gt;Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announcing their COVID-19 diagnoses&lt;/a&gt;. After that day, it seemed like everyone talked about COVID-19 a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8aBl4"&gt;A year on, I’m glad that many are now vaccinated and that hopefully soon, many more will be. But I also wonder how we’ll all be irrevocably changed from our time in the pandemic. — &lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hbbK0c"&gt;
&lt;p id="VMYbAi"&gt;By the time the WHO made the official call that we were in a pandemic, the swirling fear and unrelenting news had already started messing with our heads. Just a few weeks into living and working at home, and we started to lose track of what day of the week it was. My family would sit down for dinner, look at each other, and try to remember if we’d just finished our Thursday zoom meetings or if it was only Tuesday. Eventually, we started raising a glass to the day of the week. “Monday?” “Monday.” &amp;lt;clink&amp;gt; We still do it every night.  &lt;em&gt;—Mary Beth Griggs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XPJQZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;we started to lose track of what day of the week it was&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="34AlDQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="9bn3s4"&gt;On March 10th, I took a selfie with a woman who had fallen asleep on me during my commute home. I joked that “social distancing in NYC is going great!” The next day, I showed up to the office and only a handful of my colleagues were in, but all of the snacks were gone. I had a few bags of chips stowed away at my desk, and I used chopsticks to eat them because I was afraid of touching my mouth.  &lt;em&gt;—Cory Zapatka &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Ipq3GY"&gt;
&lt;p id="i3vmUr"&gt;I distinctly remember taking the dog for an early morning walk around this time last year and being shocked that there were no cars — literally none — on what’s usually a very traffick-y road into Downtown Pittsburgh. It was eerily quiet, and it was the first time it hit home for me how huge the situation really was. Now, whenever I venture out in the car, the lack of traffic is actually really nice, if still a bit disconcerting. I’m hopeful this might make us rethink our dependence on cars, but I think it’s too early to tell whether the lack of traffic will become a permanent result of the pandemic.  &lt;em&gt;—Kim Lyons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ijCoct"&gt;
&lt;p id="jsTyMT"&gt;“Today is Thursday” was trending on Twitter on March 19th, and several &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers started musing about how an automated reminder of what day of the week it was would be nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTxBsf"&gt;A bit of tinkering and a few hours later, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TodaysDayToday"&gt;@TodaysDayToday&lt;/a&gt; was born: a Twitter account that, once a day, at 9AM ET, tweets what day of the week it is. Is it a useful Twitter account? Not exactly, but I do find it strangely comforting to see each morning, even a year later. And despite the timeless, WFH pandemic void, some things never changed: people still love Fridays and dread Mondays, if replies to the bot are anything to go by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB8eOP"&gt;One year later, and time keeps on moving forward. Things might almost start looking like normal again soon. But my little Twitter bot will still keep ticking on, too. And in case you were wondering: today is Thursday. &lt;em&gt; —Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="QAGJal"&gt;At the very beginning of the pandemic, our entire family had COVID and didn’t know it. My husband had gotten a false positive flu test, I spent about three weeks in bed with exhaustion and low appetite, our older son had fever and chills for two days, and our daughter had a fever for a morning that never returned after taking Motrin. But there were no tests around and nothing to do about it. And the positive flu test gave us hope. Then one day, as I was cleaning the bathroom, I wasn’t able to smell the Clorox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WGSx4I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One day, as I was cleaning the bathroom, I wasn’t able to smell the Clorox&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qaB7xz"&gt;My husband who has year-round allergies and can never smell couldn’t help me. Our housekeeper who hadn’t been there in over three weeks assured me that the bleach was not watered down. But no matter how much I sniffed, I could not smell the faintest trace of bleach. I felt like I was losing my mind. I finally decided to spray my clothes, and, alas, within seconds they were covered in bleach stains. Not long after, reports came out about COVID’s effects relating to loss of smell and taste. Antibody tests confirmed we had had it, but the memory of me frantically running around our apartment spraying myself with bleach will stay with us forever.  &lt;em&gt;—Esther Cohen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6HZ6YP"&gt;2020 was going to be my first year living on my own, and the newfound independence was exhilarating. Then March came roaring in with a pandemic that trapped me in my apartment. At the beginning of the month, when the pandemic was still mostly just an ominous cloud on the horizon, I stumbled across the most precious dog online. Her name was Trudee. I had been wanting a dog for months, so I put in an application to the local rescue. After several interviews, I was approved to adopt her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JipR7"&gt;On March 17th, I drove from Columbus to Cleveland to pick her up. The highways were unusually empty. On March 18th, Ohio’s governor began to shut down businesses across the state. It was when this call came that I realized I was facing weeks or even months of loneliness in this apartment I was once so excited to be in. I remember hanging my head and crying out of fear of the isolation inside and the deadly disease outside. Trudee, however, was my saving grace. She kept the loneliness at bay, and we’ve been inseparable since.  &lt;em&gt;—Kaitlin Hatton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dvKPz6"&gt;
&lt;p id="4xFj72"&gt;The pandemic’s start was actually supposed to be one of the coolest work trips of my career: a super-secret visit to Seattle, where I would play Valve’s then-upcoming &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;. Valve wisely canceled the trip and let reporters play &lt;em&gt;Alyx &lt;/em&gt;at home instead, and within a few days, I was in self-quarantine at the virus epicenter in New York City after an employee at Vox’s offices tested positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ2ty4"&gt;The result is that I spent the early pandemic locked inside my apartment with a giant batch of mushy homemade enchiladas, wearing a VR headset I brought home on my very last trip from our office, trying to write something that sounded like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;normal review for a major video game franchise&lt;/a&gt; instead of a panicky dispatch from a plague exclusion zone. It’s the only time I’ve ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192359/valve-half-life-alyx-interview-sean-vanaman-corey-peters-dystopia-vr-hope"&gt;introduced a developer interview&lt;/a&gt; by casually mentioning the local disease death toll. (I guess it was 125 back then, which is heartbreakingly low in retrospect since, within weeks, the city would watch bodies pile up in freezers and a mass grave.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1VSsHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Half-Life: Alyx’ is a very good VR shooter about space zombies. And 30,000 people in my city are dead.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud1omP"&gt;I rewrote the opening paragraph to that article about 50 times, and that was the least dramatic version I came up with. Because outside VR, all I remember is grief and fury. Spending every night listening to ambulances flood the local hospital, waking up to smug pundits and politicians insisting the pandemic wasn’t real, mocking New Yorkers for being afraid of a disease nobody could cure or understand. Worrying a vicious sore throat I’d had in early March was actually COVID-19, edging around the idea I’d infected somebody else and killed them. Watching footage of people lining up for hours hoping to get tested, while the president called the whole thing a hoax. And then — where was I? Right. Video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKXaND"&gt;Long story short, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; is a very good VR shooter about space zombies. And 30,000 people in my city are dead.  &lt;em&gt;—Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bwV1rZ"&gt;
&lt;p id="2A8UHz"&gt;I was in Austin, Texas, profiling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238529/the-chive-bro-frat-culture-founders-misogyny"&gt;the eccentric brothers behind &lt;em&gt;The Chive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when stuff started to get really weird. It was March 11th — the World Health Organization had just declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. I remember sitting in my hotel room wondering if I’d made a big mistake. Was I going to get stuck in Texas? My editor, Kevin Nguyen, had asked me before I left if I felt comfortable traveling, and I’d answered honestly when I said yes. But now I felt really vulnerable. There was so much uncertainty — rumors that had seemed quite outlandish (they’re going to shut down air travel!) were suddenly within the realm of possibility. I bought hand sanitizer since &lt;em&gt;The Chive&lt;/em&gt; guys were big on shaking hands.  &lt;em&gt;—Zoë Schiffer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n2wUa0"&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Oil6"&gt;The last time I went to our office was on March 3rd, the day after I wrote about how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161824/coronavirus-death-life-care-washington-testing-surveillance"&gt;we had no idea how widely the virus was spreading&lt;/a&gt; because our testing was insufficient. The only reason I went was to record a &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; episode; I’d already decided at that point it was wisest to avoid public transit. As I did not own a car, that meant staying home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AU96MU"&gt;By then, I’d already panic-bought a bunch of nonperishable food items, cold medicine, and some bleach since I’d missed my Wednesday evening yoga class on February 26th to write about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21155378/coronavirus-california-us-case-unknown-source-community-spread-cdc"&gt;a possible community-acquired case&lt;/a&gt; in the Bay Area where I live; after that, stocking up only seemed natural.&lt;em&gt; If you’re going to panic&lt;/em&gt;, I figured, &lt;em&gt;better to panic before everyone else. &lt;/em&gt;At that point, I still believed the CDC was competent and any kind of shutdown would only last a month or so, the way it did in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VMVHGk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At that point, I still believed the CDC was competent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrxkcV"&gt;March 11th was also a Wednesday. My boyfriend and I went into our yoga class, and when we came out, Tom Hanks had been diagnosed and the NBA had canceled its season. He and I then proceeded to get into a giant fight — the only thing I was still doing was studio workout classes. He insisted, correctly, that I shouldn’t go to them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4b2j0"&gt;Also around that time, I lost faith that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176170/coronavirus-response-donald-trump-resign-crisis-pandemic-response"&gt;the US government would do anything&lt;/a&gt; to prevent coronavirus from becoming widespread. We’d been reporting on this threat for months, along with a lot of other outlets, and no one was taking it seriously. What was the point of our work? I still wonder about that; I have wondered about it every time we’ve reached a new grim milestone of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTjeFI"&gt;The fight I had with my boyfriend turned out to be irrelevant; the Bay Area shut down on March 16th. My yoga studio, where I’d gone four or five times a week for eight years, went out of business that summer.  &lt;em&gt;—Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Rj9D7q"&gt;
&lt;p id="0ucqrn"&gt;I remember a few things very clearly about the day Philly started its lockdown. I was working at a library, and I had decided to reorganize our big supply closet. I remember leaving the closet half-organized, with little piles of folders and labels on the floor that I’d “get to tomorrow.” Turns out, tomorrow wasn’t coming. I lost that job a month later, and I have no idea if anyone ever finished up tidying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIrrt7"&gt;When our boss told us to head home, my co-workers and I decided to grab a few books and DVDs to entertain ourselves while we were stuck at home. There was a funny “kids in a candy shop” feeling: a bunch of library workers moseying around the stacks of an empty library, taking our pick of materials to hunker down with. I think we thought, naively in retrospect, that it might be a few weeks of working from home and then back to normal. A year later, I still have my pile of library books, tucked in a box that I use as a footrest at my desk. (Library friends, if you’re reading this, I swear I will return them eventually.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICIjRV"&gt;I was too terrified to take the train or a ride-share home that day, so I hitched a ride with my equally terrified partner. We stopped at a few grocery stores (no toilet paper in sight) and a liquor store on the way. There was a bottle of Corona on the shelf outfitted with the head and legs of a virus, and I stared at it for a long moment trying to decide if it was cute or horribly morbid.  &lt;em&gt;—Kait Sanchez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xbnOpd"&gt;
&lt;p id="jIH92D"&gt;I have bad anxiety, so I stocked up on nonperishables and hand sanitizer in late February. During my last commute home from work, I didn’t have any gloves so I placed (obviously clean and unused) dog poop bags over my hands so I could hold the pole on the train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MK7IBt"&gt;I remember people telling me I must be so relieved that my wedding was set for August 28th, and that this would all blow over by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="20aN73"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I had already resigned myself to having to stay home, probably forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zWZ4Q"&gt;My parents and wedding caterer are both in upstate New York, and my partner and I were too scared of potentially spreading it to them to drive up. So my parents volunteered to go to the wedding tasting for us on March 14th. I FaceTimed them from my MacBook while they tried stuffed mushrooms, sweet and sour meatballs, and goat cheese puffs. I nodded along while I Googled “DIY sourdough starter” in the background. I am an eternal pessimist, so at that point, I had already resigned myself to having to stay home, probably forever. The wedding would obviously have to be postponed. I would never leave the house again! Therefore, my main concern, other than the crushing feeling of the world crumbling around me, was that all of my friends were showing off beautiful loaves of bread on Instagram — and I hadn’t picked up yeast during my grocery run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWPUAa"&gt;We decided to postpone the wedding by the end of March. My sourdough starter died a few days later. I cried when I scraped it into the trash, and then again, a week later, when I described it to my therapist over Zoom.  &lt;em&gt;—Sarah Smithers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ezCbpd"&gt;
&lt;p id="gvJEkI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has covered too many events to count in the past decade, so we were prepared to notice them crumble when COVID began to rampage across the globe. I started a simple website to track them, called Is It Canceled Yet? (I even nabbed the isitcanceledyet.com domain. Sweet.) From E3 to the Olympics, there was plenty of material to monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgQx0li3_XGX1ZQqa5jTsww-xK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22363153/uh_oh.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;isitcanceledyet.com&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2XfPu"&gt;The project was mostly lighthearted and dusted lightly with humor when the cancellations were coming at a trickle and when we had some optimism that everyone would come together to shut down the spread of the virus. But then we learned our government and many of our neighbors wouldn’t take it seriously, and the trickle became a flood, and now 500,000 Americans are dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSIwVa"&gt;In the span of a day or two, the Is It Canceled Yet? site became too popular and too difficult for me to manage. People started pointing to it as a serious resource for knowledge about our decaying world; literally hundreds of people were tweeting at me and emailing me asking me to add things to the list or notifying me of changes. Unable to dedicate enough of my time to make the site useful and comprehensive, Is It Canceled Yet? became just another thing that was canceled.  &lt;em&gt;—T.C. Sottek &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vULbAa"&gt;
&lt;p id="kvrxg7"&gt;I moved into my own apartment two weeks before New York locked down. It’s the first time I’ve ever lived alone in the city — a longtime dream realized after years of meticulous saving and roommates who didn’t understand the concept of chores. I spent the days immediately after my move eating pizza on the floor and wishing I never had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfDPmm"&gt;The weeks that followed had no real shape. I remember dodging around other New Yorkers on the street to keep six feet between us when we were being told not to wear masks. That I had a healthy supply of hand sanitizer already from years of covering gaming conventions. How being out after sundown suddenly felt illicit; how being out at all felt dangerous. Dread and dark humor held hands during my unexpected isolation. One hour, I’d be crying hysterically until my eyes were nearly swollen shut; the next, I’d be giving myself a wax in the stupidest, most optimistic pastime I’ve had all quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on6Eto"&gt;I can’t tell you much about those first weeks or even the past year. Only a few moments have left a strong impression, and they’re best saved for therapy. But to the man who sold me this monkey’s paw: you were not clear enough on the fine print. &lt;em&gt;—Megan Farokhmanesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
