    <title>Are the royals going to vlog?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4hjAa59jgcx2xVGIXoXxO3742Q=/227x0:2651x1616/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243414/williamkatevlog.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X0s0rf"&gt;The young attractive royal couple that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Harry and Meghan has dropped a truly chaotic intro video for their shiny new official YouTube channel. In the video, the presumed future queen and king of the United Kingdom (also known as Kate Middleton and Kate Middleton’s husband) laugh and chat awkwardly in what looks like their home. It’s well-lit but not &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;well-lit: a reasonably good YouTuber rig but not exactly one of royal magnificence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apz9rO"&gt;“Be careful what you’re saying, these guys are going to start filming,” says Prince William to his smiling wife, as though she doesn’t know how cameras work. The general feel of the clip is the first few seconds after a camera starts rolling but before the YouTube stars start vlogging in earnest. Except they don’t vlog. The video then cuts to what can only be described as a hype reel of public appearances at public functions or at their various charities — not exactly an exclusive glimpse of the royals at home. Where is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Where are the chickens?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hiV7oo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What is this new channel even for?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YE3MjR"&gt;It’s not as though Will and Kate’s new channel is going to be a royal pioneer in the world of awkward webcam recordings with dubious production values. For one thing, it looks like they’ve invested in an actual setup. For another thing, the British royal family — as an official, monolithic institution — has had a YouTube channel since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/dec/23/youtube.monarchy"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. And for the past year, while much of the world has been in lockdown, the channel has become replete with recordings of Zoom meetings. From such bangers as “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge host bingo” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_6tCpOllPw&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;100K views&lt;/a&gt;) to less inspired videos like “The Earl of Wessex joins a video call with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra” (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQaEOEz780&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheRoyalFamily"&gt;4.8K views&lt;/a&gt;), the House of Windsor has been very busy addressing the masses from their laptops, at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i1X4Z"&gt;So will the Cambridges vlog or won’t they? What is this new channel even for? And what’s the deal with their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/style/meghan-markle-instagram.html"&gt;weird Instagram follower count&lt;/a&gt;, anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7biSAY"&gt;It’s impossible not to connect this latest foray into the world of #creator #platforms with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/oprah-celebrity-interview-royals/2021/03/08/7b1d21f2-8013-11eb-81db-b02f0398f49a_story.html"&gt;bombshell interview&lt;/a&gt; with Oprah or to contrast it with that other couple’s deals with Netflix and Spotify. The &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/kate-middleton-meghan-markle-fighting-drama-rumors.html"&gt;supposed bad blood&lt;/a&gt; between the princes and their wives might be more tabloid projection than reality, but it’s at least true that one couple is set to one day succeed to the throne, while the other has dealt the British monarchy a blow as severe as the &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/11/princess-diana-martin-bashir-interview"&gt;1995 Princess Diana interview&lt;/a&gt; with Martin Bashir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SmL5t0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CYICv"&gt;Is the new Will and Kate YouTube channel a response to the burgeoning Harry / Meghan media empire? Is it a bid for independence from the British tabloid press? Or is it just the Kensington Palace comms team trying out something new that will wind up just as anodyne and dull as the rest of the royal family’s internet presence? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfTNmw"&gt;In truth, it’s bizarre that the British royal family is just barely keeping up with the newest changes in the media landscape. A dysfunctional rich family whose sole purpose in life is to be famous? The Windsors were influencers before they were &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britains-king-george-v-changes-royal-surname"&gt;called the Windsors&lt;/a&gt; and long before being an influencer was even a thing. How is their entire brand still in the grip of the tabloids? It’s like the royals will be the last people on earth to find out that print is dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stIJ7d"&gt;Of course, previous attempts at the “Royals: They’re Just Like Us” narrative have been met with mixed results. On the one hand, these behind-the-scenes-type video treatments have always done gangbusters in television ratings. On the other hand, the family has uniformly hated and despised these documentaries, like the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/uk/royal-family-1969-documentary-youtube-scli-gbr-intl/index.html"&gt;hilariously awkward 1969 BBC documentary&lt;/a&gt; depicting the everyday life of the royals, which is rumored to have been banned by the queen, though not until after approximately 350 million people viewed it worldwide. (The documentary made its way onto YouTube earlier this year and was quickly taken down via copyright notice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YlyY01"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CiTCy"&gt;Then there’s the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/world/prince-charles-in-tv-documentary-admits-to-infidelity.html"&gt;1994 ITV documentary&lt;/a&gt; about Prince Charles (you know, the one who married Diana) that was so disastrous for his image that a subsequent poll by &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; found that two-thirds of respondents did not want Charles to succeed as the next king. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmTwk2"&gt;Will and Kate’s request for people to like and subscribe is the latest in a weighty media legacy spanning from Edward VIII’s abdication radio broadcast to Elizabeth II’s televised coronation to the tabloid warfare that Prince William’s own parents waged against each other before his mother’s untimely death while chased by paparazzi looking to feed the content mill. Given this history, it’s understandable why the couple’s online presence in all things is so tightly controlled. However, restraint is rarely a recipe for social media success, and the royal family’s reticence and general fear of candor is exactly one of the reasons why the Meghan / Harry and Oprah interview was such a wild success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RURbq1"&gt;But who’s to say how things will turn out after all? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are, essentially, taxpayer-funded celebrities. Surely, they’ve put more thought into this than we have. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s next big Switch title is aimed at budding game designers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UxDzxzoZsqdfJbgHgr5RjDPmcIY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243321/Switch_GameBuilderGarage_MysteryCode_SCRN_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAf8Xr"&gt;Nintendo’s next game for the Switch is one you build yourself. Today the company revealed &lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt;, a new software title that’s designed to teach beginners the basics of programming and game design. It utilizes visual programming, has pre-built lessons and games, and will be launching on the Switch next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="i5OHRA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9280993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2OcyzE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt; appears to build off of some of the ideas featured in past Nintendo projects, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy"&gt;the DIY series of Labo experiences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758773/super-mario-maker-2-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The core of the experience is a playful, visual programming language that utilizes cute characters called Nodon that you can move around and assign properties to. For instance, once you insert a character node, you can attach a “stick” node and assign the Switch’s joystick to control left and right movement. (Nintendo says that there are dozens of these Nodon, each with different characteristics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8tEb2"&gt;And just like in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;, players can quickly move back and forth between building and playing in order to rapidly iterate on ideas. The app also features several different control options: Joycon controllers, touchscreen, or a USB mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYPHtT"&gt;The other half of the equation is the “Lesson Mode.” &lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt; comes with seven pre-made games — they range from a 3D platformer to a multiplayer game of tag to a side-scrolling shooter — and the tutorial takes you through how they were built, so you can see the process from scratch. Each of the games is broken down into several steps, starting with basic concepts like movement, before moving on to more complex design features like adding a counter or game-over screen. Outside of those seven games, there’s a “free programming” mode, where players can build whatever they want. This mode is also available from the beginning if you don’t want to go through the built-in lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RiE8q5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Learn to make games from the minds at Nintendo! Build your own games from the ground up with the colorful and quirky Nodon when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameBuilderGarage?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GameBuilderGarage&lt;/a&gt; comes to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt; on June 11!&lt;a href="https://t.co/OLw5XSTAMs"&gt;https://t.co/OLw5XSTAMs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1A5ovEc5ZM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1A5ovEc5ZM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1390064521885147137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="agk1Av"&gt;Naturally, players will also be able to share their creations via a code that can be sent to other players. (Nintendo says that there will be an option to report inappropriate games, particularly given &lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt;’s younger target audience.) In order to share their creations, players will need a Nintendo Switch Online connection. Once you download someone else’s game, you’ll not only be able to play it but also look at the programming view to see how it was designed. You can even make a copy to build on top of another player’s creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXttjQ"&gt;Over the last few years, Nintendo has steadily been putting a bigger focus on building user-friendly creation tools and bringing them to a wider audience. In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11327140/nintendo-super-mario-maker-education-sfpl"&gt;the company partnered with the San Francisco Public Library&lt;/a&gt; to host a series of game design lessons via &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18009754/nintendo-labo-teacher-guide-educational-school"&gt;in 2018 it launched a pilot program to bring Labo to schools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04Ziz8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Builder Garage&lt;/em&gt; will be available on June 11th for $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US supports lifting patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwAV-GUkSkniJdZ1apjkePPbYZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243052/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Dow9F"&gt;The Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it supported waiving patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines, calling the pandemic a “global health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NMjXi"&gt;“This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures. The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines,” United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves/status/1390023314211491841"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxUgQZ"&gt;Waiving those protections would theoretically let countries and organizations manufacture patented vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.msf.org/countries-obstructing-covid-19-patent-waiver-must-allow-negotiations"&gt;without facing repercussions&lt;/a&gt;. But they would need to have the expertise and materials on hand to actually produce the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xi7IE"&gt;India and South Africa had &lt;a href="https://pop-umbrella.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/e9989bf5-7d26-4d4d-8336-8d37f1577529_W669.pdf?key="&gt;previously proposed&lt;/a&gt; that the World Trade Organization (WTO) suspend certain intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments in an effort to ramp up production and distribute vaccines more widely. That effort, which started last October, was blocked by a small number of countries, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/covid-rich-countries-are-refusing-to-waive-ip-rights-on-vaccines.html"&gt;including the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9d2rc8"&gt;India and South Africa are now &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-south-africa-to-make-fresh-push-for-waiver-of-vaccine-patents-at-wto-101619886294125.html"&gt;making a renewed push&lt;/a&gt; for waivers at the WTO, and this time, the effort will have US support. Tai pledged that the US would actively negotiate at the WTO to make waivers happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruR8Z3"&gt;“As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts – working with the private sector and all possible partners – to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines,” Tai said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGjcP1"&gt;While the US has secured &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/02/11/biden-administration-purchases-additional-doses-covid-19-vaccines-from-pfizer-and-moderna.html"&gt;hundreds of millions of doses&lt;/a&gt; of various vaccines, other countries have struggled to purchase and produce enough vaccines for their populations. The US has fully vaccinated more than &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;32 percent of its population&lt;/a&gt;. India, which is currently wrestling with a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-covid-19-crisis-raises-pressure-to-waive-vaccine-patents-11619861401"&gt;horrific surge in cases&lt;/a&gt;, has fully vaccinated just 2.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0C3SM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is ruining the open for surprise meme with better image crops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axYvoP9lpdByAfm1wRmIGL2GUxA=/123x27:1050x645/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69242684/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_1.07.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqVj2Q"&gt;Twitter is finally rolling out a long-awaited feature: bigger images that don’t crop in so darn much. Now, image previews should show way more of the image, giving you a better idea of what you’re actually looking at, and avoiding embarrassing situations where Twitter’s cropping algorithm picks the absolute wrong thing to focus on (sometimes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1307440596668182528%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323298%2Ftwitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;with apparent racial bias&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nk7Imr"&gt;Twitter announced it would be testing the improvement on iOS and Android &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt;, and it should now be making its way to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OqrVNE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;no bird too tall, no crop too short&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;introducing bigger and better images on iOS and Android, now available to everyone &lt;a href="https://t.co/2buHfhfRAx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2buHfhfRAx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1390026628957417473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3pBqOu"&gt;Those pictures should also be clearer, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396245/twitter-4k-images-photos-android-ios-apps-update"&gt;Twitter’s recent update to 4K images&lt;/a&gt; — because some art just needs to be seen as clear as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CmaKwW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New twitter crop dropped, it's Dinopost time &lt;a href="https://t.co/bbRL6VMhNU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bbRL6VMhNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1390035095302467584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C95G5z"&gt;Of course, Twitter giveth and Twitter taketh away — the change will, for the most part, make the “open for a surprise” tweets not so surprising. I suppose it’s a fair trade-off to avoid the sometimes wildly embarrassing crops that used to plague the platform. (Or at least it is for me, someone who follows a ton of artists and is tired of scrolling past poorly cropped drawings that actually end up being really good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pCKXv"&gt;And hey, if you want to see those memes, it seems like the web version of Twitter on desktops is still susceptible. Hide on, tiny cat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A bug in Peloton’s API may have exposed a whole lot of user data</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncQozM"&gt;An old version of Peloton’s API, the software that allows the company’s bikes and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalled treadmills&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with its servers, may have exposed private customer profiles, according to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The bug was first spotted by Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, and reported to Peloton on January 20th, but the company is only just now confirming that the bug has been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuZLzG"&gt;Using Peloton’s API, Masters was able to scrape all sorts of customer information that would typically be private, depending on the individual user’s settings. That includes customer profiles, which can potentially feature their age, location, birthday, and workout history. All Masters had to do was make an unauthenticated request to Peloton’s API and customer data was his. Masters has a more thorough explanation of how the exploit worked &lt;a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000"&gt;on Pen Test Partners’ blog&lt;/a&gt; and also summarized his findings in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iEKwp2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WMgvMajthkI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="75le1b"&gt;After reporting the bug to Peloton, Masters set a 90-day deadline to address the issue. That deadline came and went without Peloton saying whether the API was fixed, which prompted Masters to turn to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. Peloton finally responded and shared the following statement with the publication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iTuetT"&gt;It’s a priority for Peloton to keep our platform secure and we’re always looking to improve our approach and process for working with the external security community. Through our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure program, a security researcher informed us that he was able to access our API and see information that’s available on a Peloton profile. We took action, and addressed the issues based on his initial submissions, but we were slow to update the researcher about our remediation efforts. Going forward, we will do better to work collaboratively with the security research community and respond more promptly when vulnerabilities are reported. We want to thank Ken Munro for submitting his reports through our CVD program and for being open to working with us to resolve these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dWdC3P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15408338/bike-peloton-review-indoor-cycle-live-streaming-cycling"&gt;The screens on Peloton’s bikes&lt;/a&gt; and treadmills are what make the company’s workout ways so compelling. It’s how subscribers attend classes, track their workouts, and even do other non-bike or treadmill exercises. It’s a feature that Peloton charges $39 per month for an all-access membership to. Yet, like all connected devices, particularly fitness ones, it can leave private customer information more vulnerable than a non-connected stationary bike would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSNrpr"&gt;Masters writes that Peloton apologized and said it resolved a majority of the API issues within a week of his report. What’s not immediately clear is if anyone other than Masters gained access to customer data while the API was in a leaky state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p86hZq"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;followed up to check&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Peloton said it had nothing new to share that it hadn’t already provided &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; and Pen Test Partners. The company also reiterated it responded to the API issue immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsxuNt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon wants to make sure drivers who don’t work for the company are well-groomed and nice online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cAb6seFMQ-ia5NylhdGN8motOt4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69242157/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ZrK3F"&gt;Amazon is infamous for tightly controlling its workers and contractors, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-05/amazon-work-rules-govern-tweets-body-odor-of-contract-drivers"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that it also tries to control the employees of companies that it contracts. The company has explicit policies concerning personal grooming and social media etiquette that apply to the drivers from other delivery companies. The rules govern everything from how the delivery people look (they must have clean fingernails, teeth, ears, and hair) to how they smell (no bad breath, body odor, or immodest perfume). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHHUeG"&gt;The rules also apparently forbid drivers from making social media posts that could be considered obscene. That by itself wouldn’t be remarkable, but it’s worth noting that these policies are applied to drivers that don’t work for Amazon, and so reach much further than the company’s official employee base. The drivers are instead employees of local delivery companies that are contracted by Amazon through its Delivery Service Partners program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhY8Xh"&gt;The workers for these companies are the same ones affected &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347945/amazon-delivery-drivers-ai-surveillance-cameras-vans-consent-form"&gt;by the company’s AI-powered cameras&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers have to consent to always-on cameras monitoring them for things like distracted driving or traffic violations if they want to work (or keep working) by delivering packages for the retail giant. Amazon’s plan to install the cameras was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;discovered through a video&lt;/a&gt; where an Amazon manager explained the partnership between the company and the camera manufacturer. &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; has since discovered driver consent forms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAa5JQ"&gt;Amazon is well-known for not giving its employees (or those who work under its umbrella) much leeway when it comes to handling their personal lives — many warehouse employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892693/amazon-protest-time-off-part-time-workers-sacramento-fired"&gt;have to micromanage their time away from work&lt;/a&gt; to avoid being fired, and the company allegedly constantly texted employees during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;the recent Alabama union drive&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon’s leadership, including Jeff Bezos, has claimed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385762/bezos-letter-shareholders-amazon-workers-union-bessemer-workplace"&gt;doesn’t treat its employees like robots&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s hard to look at rules like this for drivers who aren’t even contractors and believe that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWfxyP"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s feud with Apple over xCloud on iOS got a rival kicked from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpd1t7o7MzXlDkz8zfhVU81tQI0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241844/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="59ak2k"&gt;In 2020, Microsoft was battling to bring xCloud or Xbox Game Streaming to the iPhone and iPad, and the conversations had an unlikely victim: Shadow — a third-party cloud gaming app that lets you stream PC games to an iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cZfC5"&gt;Emails between Microsoft and Apple, revealed in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial today, show how the Xbox maker was trying to get xCloud on iOS. Microsoft was trying to figure out how Shadow, Netflix, and other similar “interactive” apps were able to exist in the App Store while Apple was refusing to approve xCloud. Microsoft put forward Shadow as an example of such a service, only to see it suddenly removed from the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSJBCU"&gt;“We were showing two examples where a game or an application was able to exist, and we didn’t understand why we couldn’t,” explained Lori Wright, Microsoft’s head of business development for Xbox, during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial today. “I believe they [Apple] ended up pulling Shadow out of the App Store based off this email we sent until they submitted changes. That was not our intention of course, it was a byproduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwP09JyRmiWPgyGUd-04tZfidVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493777/0_yXBrpxirKTDnT7a8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Shadow&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow on iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="REs2dG"&gt;While Shadow’s removal wasn’t permanent, Apple has temporarily removed the app from the App Store twice in the past year. Shadow was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowPC/comments/f9wtjl/shadow_ios_app_removed_from_the_app_store/"&gt;first removed in February&lt;/a&gt; last year, with Apple reportedly citing a “failure to act in accordance with a specific part of the Apple App Store Guidelines.” Apple once again &lt;a href="https://forum.shadow.tech/news-announcements-42/shadow-removed-from-apple-app-store-what-you-should-know-2314"&gt;removed Shadow from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; in February, and the app returned a week later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDi8OE"&gt;Shadow revealed that the app was removed the second time “due to a misunderstanding” around the nature of the app. “Unlike game streaming services, Shadow provides a full Windows 10 PC, rather than a library of games,” explained Luc Hancock, a community manager for Shadow. “This unique approach allows Shadow to comply with the App Store guidelines, so that you can access your Shadow PC on any iOS device to run your favorite games and software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vb5FdM"&gt;Valve struggled for more than a year to launch its Steam Link game streaming service on iOS. Apple rejected the app, likely because it allowed an iOS user to access another app store, Steam, within Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17430532/apple-app-store-rules-valve-steam-link-game-streaming"&gt;Apple revised its rules&lt;/a&gt; after rejecting Steam Link, and the app was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released"&gt;finally approved two years ago in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;xCloud on iOS via the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOUoIU"&gt;Apple continued to make it difficult for services like xCloud and Stadia to run the way Microsoft and Google wanted to on iOS devices after those conversations, only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;slowly making App Store policy carve-outs&lt;/a&gt; that would let the services operate under severe restrictions. Apple now insists that developers individually submit games as separate apps using their streaming tech, only then bundling them together as a “catalog”-style app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoZYSl"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;wasn’t impressed with Apple’s approach&lt;/a&gt;, calling it a “bad experience for customers.” This public spat has now boiled over into the courtroom battle between Epic Games and Apple, with lawyers on Epic’s side questioning Microsoft and Nvidia representatives about their struggles to bring cloud gaming apps to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRnKrD"&gt;Both Microsoft and Nvidia have had to give in to Apple’s restrictions and launch their cloud gaming services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;through the Safari web browser&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has no reason to ever resolve the Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgW1WrELnnFDGsPn02JIhq9NZj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241739/acastro_180501_1777_facebook_dating_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WIpHQY"&gt;After months of waiting, today Facebook’s Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;finally handed down&lt;/a&gt; the biggest ruling of its short existence — the question of whether to uphold the ban on Donald Trump. The verdict? Send the question back to Facebook, and give them six more months to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zak47n"&gt;In fairness, it wasn’t quite that bad. The initial ban was upheld, and the board &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-691QAMHJ/"&gt;made specific rulings&lt;/a&gt; on the questions of whether Trump’s posts were inciting violence, and whether world leaders should get special treatment. For now, Facebook can continue to block Trump, which means that on the face of it, this is a win for anti-Trumpers. Unless you’re visiting his self-hosted website, you’ll remain blessedly safe from Trump posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QiG0V5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“an endless cycle of uncertainty”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJuF0J"&gt;But the ruling also went out of its way to avoid settling the long-term question of whether Facebook is allowed to permanently ban leaders like Trump. The board found the initial ban was justified since Trump’s January 6th posts really did incite violence — but it wasn’t enough to justify a permanent ban. So even as the board affirmed the initial ban, it called on Facebook to set a new policy for how and when Trump could regain Facebook access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZjw9c"&gt;“It is not permissible for Facebook to keep a user off the platform for an undefined period, with no criteria for when or whether the account will be restored,” the ruling reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCm3aZ"&gt;In practical terms, that means Facebook is going to keep litigating the specifics of the Trump ban for at least the next six months, and probably a whole lot longer. Facebook has until October to come up with a specific policy to justify the ban, to be put in place across the platform. But that policy will likely need more review from inside Facebook once it’s developed, and then another round of appeal to the Oversight Board. Then Trump can try to get back on Facebook (or make just enough effort to justify restarting his feud with the platform), and there will need to be another round of reviews on that, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="yum3oR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Republicans who are mad can make their case to the board and have their opinions heard — whether it does them any good or not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ0o1c"&gt;And of course, because none of the Oversight decisions are binding on Facebook, the company is free to delay past any of those deadlines if it wants more time. In a statement after the decision, the progressive group Common Cause described it as “an endless cycle of uncertainty,” and it’s hard to disagree. The process could easily stretch through the 2024 election, and given the political interests involved, it’s not clear how it could ever fully resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCZBcV"&gt;If you were hoping to stop talking about Donald Trump online, this is close to a worst-case scenario. The moderation merry-go-round is a political liability for Facebook, and the longer it goes unresolved, the more anger will be stirred up against the platform. The point of founding the Oversight Board was to shovel some of that responsibility onto another group, but this decision puts the ball right back in Facebook’s court. You can already see conservative media figures using the ruling to take shots at the company — and I’m sure lots of Facebook employees are shuddering at the prospect of doing it all again in six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phsC3k"&gt;But there’s a deeper logic to the ruling, one that benefits both the Oversight Board and Facebook itself. As &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/05/americans-divided-on-whether-trump-should-be-permanently-banned-from-social-media/"&gt;a Pew Research poll&lt;/a&gt; showed this morning, America is split over the question of whether Trump should be on Facebook, and a final ruling is sure to alienate one side or another. So from Facebook’s perspective, the less final this ruling is, the better. What looks like kicking the can down the road is really just leaving the door open for the losing side. Republicans who are mad can make their case to the board and have their opinions heard — whether it does them any good or not. And the next time Mark Zuckerberg is called before Congress, he can tell Republicans he’s working on a final policy that will get Trump back online. When he’s called a year later (or two years, or five years), he can say the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UEewBd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making a decision means taking sides&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SzDkZV"&gt;Platforms love keeping policy questions in limbo this way, in part because making a firm decision is so likely to cause trouble. Look at Twitter, which is always “thinking about” new features like &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/is-tweet-editing-coming-does-it-really-matter/547614/"&gt;editable tweets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content"&gt;paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, but never seems to launch them. Or look at Facebook’s own behavior in politically unstable countries like Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where civil society groups said they worked with the platform for years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/18/17369570/facebook-coalition-myanmar-syria-sri-lanka-moderation-transparency-audit"&gt;without ever getting a real response to their demands&lt;/a&gt;. Making a decision means taking sides — and for a platform built on scale, that gambit rarely pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gY5QCd"&gt;You can see the same logic working in the Oversight Board itself. The board is slightly better positioned than Facebook to make unpopular decisions, but it’s still been careful to guard its credibility. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;The rulings so far&lt;/a&gt; have mostly made fine distinctions on existing policies, whether it’s ethnic slurs in Russia or not-quite hate speech in Burma. If the board makes an unpalatable decision — either kicking Trump off the platform permanently or, worse, letting him back on — it would face the same problem as Facebook: potentially losing credibility with an entire portion of Facebook’s user base. Better to kick the can down the road, “keep thinking,” and never land too hard on any one ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DaMBt"&gt;That’s not to say the Oversight Board won’t do anything unpopular. Today’s ruling has already made a lot of conservatives angry, just as the initial ban did. Plotting a middle course doesn’t mean no one will be angry, and there will surely be more moments in the future when Facebook’s refusal to take sides makes one side particularly angry. But if you’re looking for certainty or finality from the Oversight Board’s appeal system, you’re looking in the wrong place. For now, the performative pondering of hard questions is just too convenient to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Riigw1"&gt;Twitter is updating its “be nice, think twice” system that prompts users to reconsider when they’re about to tweet a “potentially harmful or offensive” reply. The upgraded feature is now better at spotting “strong language,” claims Twitter; is more aware of vocabulary that has been “reclaimed by underrepresented communities” and is used in non-harmful ways; and also now takes into account your relationship with the person you’re messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOFaLj"&gt;In other words, if you’re tweeting at a mutual who you interact with regularly, Twitter will assume “there’s a higher likelihood [you] have a better understanding of preferred tone of communication” and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; show you a prompt. So, you can call your friend a **** or a ****-**** or even a ****-******* son of a ****-less ***** and Twitter won’t care. That’s freedom, folks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JudW4"&gt;Twitter first started testing this system in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, paused it a little later, then brought it back to life in &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/22/twitter-relaunches-review-before-you-tweet-offensive-language/"&gt;February this year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of a number of prompts the company has been testing to try and shape user behavior, including its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;read before you retweet&lt;/a&gt;” message.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample prompt shown to a user before sending an offensive reply. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XXvRLu"&gt;Improvements to the offensive-tweets prompt will roll out to English users of the Twitter iOS app today and to Android users “in the next few days.” The company says it’s already making a difference to how people interact on the platform, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itdoQE"&gt;Twitter claims internal tests show 34 percent of people who were served such a prompt “revised their initial reply or decided to not send their reply at all.” After receiving such a prompt once, people composed, on average, 11 percent “fewer offensive replies.” And people who were prompted about a reply (and therefore may have toned down their language) were themselves “less likely to receive offensive and harmful replies back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX0O3k"&gt;These “statistics” are as opaque as you would expect from any major internet platform (how exactly has the company quantified “less likely” in that last example? How many people are included in any of these tests? How do we know that people who revised their reply made it less offensive, or did they just use offensive language the system didn’t recognize?). But the ongoing roll-out does suggest that the feature is, at least, not making things &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; worse on Twitter. That’s probably the best we can hope for. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix switches from prestige pics to shredded zombies for its widest theatrical release yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rb6xTYn9GSxdIS6hcPMjG71lMro=/708x0:4188x2320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69241389/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_9.42.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQMh8K"&gt;Netflix is taking a different route for its new Zack Snyder-directed zombie heist movie, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300924/army-of-the-dead-trailer-zack-snyder-netflix-vegas-heist-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than skip theaters and drop the new thriller directly in subscribers’ laps and homes, the company has reached an agreement with theater chains to screen the movie a week early starting May 14th in around 600 theaters, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead-netflix-theaters-1234966466/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgCMet"&gt;That’s Netflix’s widest US release yet for one of its feature projects, and it positions the film and the company to capture summer theatergoers’ attention and dollars right as screens are beginning to reopen across the country, and newly vaccinated film fans feel comfortable enough to watch how they used to. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;says Netflix has partnered with Cinemark, Alamo Drafthouse, iPic, Landmark, Harkins, and Cinépolis theaters to make the release happen. Cinemark will reportedly screen &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead &lt;/em&gt;in 200 of its theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89SlsZ"&gt;In comparison to a traditional blockbuster release that can reach thousands of theaters, 600 might seem minor, but this is Netflix, a company that’s usually scorned the traditional theatrical release model. Theaters typically want a 90-day window for theatrical releases so that people have a reason to go see a movie in person. This is why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ same-day streaming and theater release strategy&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max films stirred up so much controversy. Theaters need a reason for people to show up, especially during the pandemic when they’re at their most vulnerable. Streaming services might not feel so generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XT4ll"&gt;Past major Netflix releases have only chosen to screen in theaters to qualify for awards like the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903107/netflix-the-irishman-martin-scorsese-belasco-theater-screening-award-eligibility"&gt;and have sometimes struggled&lt;/a&gt; to find cinemas that wanted to play ball. &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/roma-movie-review-alfonso-cuaron.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which won Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, was only shown in around 250 theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/irishman-netflix-theaters.html#:~:text=The%20film%20eventually%20played%20on,them%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;amp;text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Irishman%E2%80%9D%20will%20move%20on,short%20of%20a%20major%20release."&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Martin Scorsese’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887812/the-irishman-movie-review-netflix-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-al-pacino-joe-pesci-nyff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; received a limited release in eight theaters initially and hit around 550 theaters at its widest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onE0CY"&gt;There’s only &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H83kjG5RCT8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer&lt;/a&gt; to go off of, but shooting for something closer to a big blockbuster summer release seems to make sense for a zombie movie. It could be fun! &lt;/p&gt;
