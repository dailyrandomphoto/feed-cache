    <title>Squid Game director confirms season two, says he’s in the ‘planning process’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q47KJC2M5p7RFaCQq-2hRZTURxo=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117293/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_3.32.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CjxZyP"&gt;If you’re still reeling from the end of &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; season one, get ready to board the emotional rollercoaster once again because season two is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="15mw7R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;COMEBACK SQUID: Hwang Dong-hyuk, the director, creator, writer of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SquidGame?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SquidGame&lt;/a&gt; says the show will be back with more Gi-hun adventures. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uqC1DIdZqy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uqC1DIdZqy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/APEntertainment/status/1458060909319004170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eBTwH3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; tweeted out a brief clip of an interview with director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who confirms that season two is in the works. “I will say there will indeed be a second season,” Dong-hyuk tells &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; while standing next to Lee Jung-jae, the actor who plays &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;’s beloved protagonist, Gi-hun. “It’s in my head right now. I’m in the planning process currently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFIARu"&gt;It really doesn’t come as a surprise that Netflix gave the series the green light for season two, considering that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;the platform’s most-watched show at launch&lt;/a&gt;, raking in 111 million viewers after airing for just 17 days. &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is such a hit that Netflix even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761602/netflix-squid-game-director-movies"&gt;added three more films directed by Dong-hyuk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzLLH"&gt;“There’s been so much pressure, so much demand, and so much love for a second season. So I almost feel like you leave us no choice,” Dong-hyuk continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UhQ2N"&gt;While Dong-hyuk says that it’s “too early” to determine when or how season two will be released, he did give us a small hint at what’s to come: “I will promise you this: Gi-hun will come back — he will do something for the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new $249 Surface Laptop SE is its first true Chromebook competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JBu2b9NK2G_nxYrZK5n9yMJ_tB8=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117225/COMR_Feature_02_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop SE is designed for schools.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmEkjs"&gt;Microsoft is going head to head with Chromebooks with a new $249 Surface Laptop SE, its most affordable Surface yet. While the software giant has attempted to compete with the popularity of Chrome OS in US schools for years, the Surface Laptop SE is the company’s first true Chromebook competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkXeT6"&gt;Surface Laptop SE will be sold exclusively to schools and students, starting at $249. It’s part of a much broader effort with Windows 11 SE, a new student edition designed to compete with Chrome OS that will ship on a range of low-cost laptops in the coming months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22535783"&gt;You can read all about Windows 11 SE right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MW4W8o2CmL49D6yl6ZOLGjLLNOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998165/COMR_Feature_03_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop SE is all plastic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="veNfSF"&gt;Surface Laptop SE is every bit the low-cost Windows device you’d expect to see for $249. While it retains the same keyboard and trackpad found on Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Go, the all-plastic body houses an 11.6-inch display running at just a 1366 x 768 resolution. This is the first 16:9 Surface device in more than seven years, after Microsoft switched to 3:2 for its Surface line with the Surface Pro 3 launch in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKrxqZ"&gt;The screen looks like the biggest drawback on this device, particularly as we weren’t fans of the low-resolution screen (1536 x 1024) found on the $549 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21512680/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Surface Laptop Go&lt;/a&gt;. Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet ships with a better 10.1-inch (1920 x 1200) display for the same $249 price as the Surface Laptop SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpIoIX"&gt;Intel’s Celeron N4020 or N4120 power the Surface Laptop SE, combined with 4GB / 8GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of eMMC storage. Microsoft is including a 1-megapixel front-facing camera that offers 720P support, so it should hold up okay for Teams meetings. The Surface Laptop SE also includes a single USB-A port, one USB-C port, a regular barrel-type DC connector, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. That means this is also the first Surface laptop to ship without Microsoft’s magnetic Surface charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVNxKBmn5LZCB5cer1AHIrwkeiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998167/COMR_Feature_01_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop SE ships with Windows 11 SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aXoEmf"&gt;That’s not the only first for the Surface Laptop SE, though. Microsoft is committing to a big repairability effort with the Surface Laptop SE, allowing schools to replace components inside the laptop. The base of the Surface Laptop SE has standard screws that will allow IT admins to replace the display, battery, keyboard, and even the motherboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9imMTD"&gt;Microsoft has spent the past 18 months talking to IT admins about the pain points of managing laptops in schools, and repairability was one of the top concerns. Microsoft will sell spare parts through its authorized service providers, and it should mean schools can replace components on site instead of having to send devices for repair and wait days or weeks for them to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZBjgm"&gt;We’re expecting to see similar repairability in other Surface laptops in the future, as Microsoft has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715241/microsoft-as-you-sow-right-to-repair-study-agreement"&gt;make its devices easier to repair&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DG1o1z"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Surface Laptop SE in early 2022 starting at $249, available in the US, UK, Canada, and Japan. A range of Windows 11 SE laptops will also be available from Acer, Asus, Dell, Dynabook, Fujitsu, HP, JK-IP, Lenovo, and Positivo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego’s new $800 AT-AT is practically big enough to conquer a real-life Rebel base</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LQzdfFC6qI5F6iwfjuGXdlMVegQ=/0x1:4035x2691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117219/lego_ucs_at_at_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wv2THe"&gt;Lego has announced its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fat-at-75313&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22772264%2Flego-star-wars-at-at-ultimate-collectors-edition-ucs-price-release-date-bricks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest supersized Star Wars set&lt;/a&gt;: an $800, 6,785-piece replica of the iconic AT-AT tank, most famously seen assaulting the Rebel base on Hoth in &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LU82Mc"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the new set is part of the Lego Ultimate Collector Series lineup, which has offered ultra-accurate (and ultra-pricey) recreations of classic Star Wars ships and characters for years, like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Frepublic-gunship-75309&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22772264%2Flego-star-wars-at-at-ultimate-collectors-edition-ucs-price-release-date-bricks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently released Republic Gunship&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397289/lego-new-r2-d2-star-wars-droid-may-4th-release-date-price"&gt;adorable R2-D2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLZ22A"&gt;And while Lego has released plenty of AT-AT sets before, none of them are anything close to as cool as the new one, which stands 24.5 inches high and measures 27 inches long, with posable legs and removable sides to show off the interiors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9Dl4lnngxok8GHFx_3p11dMOi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998871/lego_ucs_at_at.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aw65PV"&gt;The troop carrier is also fit to carry a (Lego-sized) Imperial legion, too: while the set only includes nine minifigures — General Veers, a Snowtrooper Commander, four Snowtroopers and two AT-AT Drivers, along with an attacking Luke Skywalker to dangle underneath — the set can fit a whopping 40 figures inside (assuming you’ve got the Stormtroopers to fill it with). The UCS AT-AT also has room for up to four speeder bikes (although sadly, only two are included) and a tripod gun for a complete Imperial attack force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3XcRZb1arLVmq3VSu7gAbpBIevo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998874/lego_ucs_at_at_25.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C0rFad"&gt;As part of the attention to detail here, the set also features “posable legs and head, opening hatches, cannons with a realistic recoil action, rotating cannons, bomb-drop hatch, and a hook to attach to Luke Skywalker’s line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cbhnew"&gt;That all said, while the gigantic AT-AT does indeed look great, it’s still not quite on the level of Lego’s magnum opus of Star Wars sets: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16234244/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-set-7541-pieces-800-dollars"&gt;2017 Ultimate Collectors Series Millennium Falcon&lt;/a&gt;, which (at least at the time) sold for the same eye-watering $800 price but had more pieces, more minifigures, and a far more iconic ship. The AT-AT just can’t quite compete with the galaxy’s fastest hunk of junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPSxn7"&gt;The new Lego UCS AT-AT set will be on sale on November 26th from Lego’s website — just in time for the holidays, assuming you can snag one. For now, we’ve dug up the highest-resolution photos we can find so you can blow them up and check out all that detail.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s gaming push could be its secret sauce for continued domination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emueazP9M1bQYL2LNJJpBBPBvmg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117164/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VrFyxS"&gt;Netflix is finally mixing games into its gargantuan library of content. It’s a huge power play and a markedly different approach from rival services that are primarily focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;snapping up IP&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a new way for Netflix to keep subscribers hooked on its service — and gaming could just be its winning play for continued streaming dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsONlc"&gt;Netflix has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18659999/stranger-things-mobile-game-netflix-walking-dead-pokemon-go-e3-2019"&gt;experimenting with gaming&lt;/a&gt; for a hot minute, but the global rollout of games within the Netflix app itself, announced last week, marks a significant shift in the streamer’s strategy for getting those games to its users. (Games began rolling out to Android devices last week, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759628/netflix-games-global-rollout-mobile-android-devices"&gt;company says&lt;/a&gt; that an iOS launch is “on the way.”) Netflix’s games will now be accessible to users much like movies, TV shows, and originals are, and they’ll be able to launch right from within the app once downloaded through the App or Play stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnuBTy"&gt;Netflix executives have said repeatedly that they think of their product as competing with everything from &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/4/17/15334122/netflix-sleep-competitor-amazon-hbo"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/05/tiktok-and-instagram-inch-closer-to-streaming-wars.html"&gt;social media apps&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-fortnite-competition-q4-earnings-2019-1"&gt;games themselves&lt;/a&gt; — essentially anything you could be doing besides watching Netflix. Netflix is competing now with more streaming and content-serving services than at any other time in its history — not only the HBO Maxes and YouTubes and Hulus of the streaming space but other apps like Instagram and TikTok. By introducing more points of entry to its content — in this case, games that build upon and expand the worlds of its existing titles — it could be safeguarding against decreased use among users who might otherwise turn to these other services or apps for entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqbXK7"&gt;Richard Broughton, a research director with Ampere Analysis, says that the firm’s recent analysis on Netflix usage underscores this goal. Every six months, Ampere polls roughly 50,000 consumers in various markets worldwide to understand how they’re using various apps and services. In its last couple of waves of research, Ampere has noticed not only stagnation but a slight erosion of subscribers in the 18- to 24-year-old bracket, Broughton tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZewWQ"&gt;“In other words, people who might’ve previously picked up Netflix among that age bracket are leaving and getting interested in other services that are coming on board, whether that’s the new studio-backed services in the US or perhaps social video services — TikTok, for instance,” Broughton says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lTAaLH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People who might’ve previously picked up Netflix among that age bracket are leaving and getting interested in other services”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP2278"&gt;What Netflix is essentially doing with games, then, is creating additional value and entertainment that could help it compete with rival services that might otherwise eat into a subscriber’s media consumption time, particularly where it concerns younger consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJz44X"&gt;“Netflix has long stated that gaming is one of the big competitors of the time, so I guess it’s part of the adage that ‘if you can’t beat them, join them,’” Broughton says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snSNiD"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; that it wants to develop games “for any level of play and every kind of player, whether you’re a beginner or a lifelong gamer.” Because the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1455580571959054341"&gt;has also said&lt;/a&gt; its games will be offered through the service as exclusives with “no ads, no additional fees and no in-app purchases” as a result of the sheer size of its subscriber base, Netflix is positioned to become a formidable presence in the subscription gaming space, Broughton says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlIA6H"&gt;“From one perspective, you could argue that Netflix is attempting to steal a bit of the market with some of the new, emerging subscription gaming platforms,” Broughton says. “Its offering still looks very different because it’s so mobile-centric as opposed to a lot of these platforms, which are focusing on Triple-A games. Nonetheless, it’s a foothold in the market and helps the company to experiment. And I suspect we’ll begin to see bigger and better games as time goes by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GB7ye6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you can’t beat them, join them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Am8PRl"&gt;However, with a modest offering at launch, Netflix’s global launch on Android had just five games available — we’re quite a ways out from Netflix being a gaming competitor in earnest, says Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner. Bonner tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that while games certainly make Netflix more “sticky,” it’ll likely be some time before we understand how games are actually impacting the service in any meaningful way. While Bonner thinks it’s a smart business strategy, in the grand scheme of Netflix’s business at present, he says, “this is a very small part of the pie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06w2BW"&gt;Netflix may be starting small on games, but the company has said it wants “to begin to build a library of games that offers something for everyone.” And Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;made it clear that it values games&lt;/a&gt; above merely swiping up whatever IP scraps are being picked over by other services. As Broughton notes, Netflix may even experiment with more advanced gaming down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dP1s51"&gt;Still, Broughton believes Netflix’s launch of games within the app itself is “absolutely essential” to ensuring widespread adoption. It lowers the barrier to entry and makes it easier for Netflix to woo potential gamers who might have otherwise missed its games entirely. And if Netflix is hoping to make itself even more addictive than it already is, games might just be the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Windows 11 SE, a new Chrome OS competitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gPRXnyePUIy43ow1KiT7opOr7x8=/0x200:4800x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70117122/WIN22_Hybrid_Learning_11SE_008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 SE is a new edition of Windows for students.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xI3Mgu"&gt;Microsoft has created a new edition of Windows 11 designed for students and schools. Windows 11 SE will ship exclusively on low-cost laptops that are built for K-8 classrooms, and it marks another attempt by Microsoft to take on Google’s range of Chromebooks and their popularity in US schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ii40fF"&gt;Microsoft has struggled to understand why schools and students have flocked to Chromebooks. The company tried an S Mode previously that essentially locked Windows 10 down to apps from the Microsoft Store. The restriction was more of an irritation for end users and schools, as there weren’t enough apps available in the Microsoft Store for it to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iOfx0vvbYKYPCLlnekJoJI2FJjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998135/Win11SE_start.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 SE comes with all the key Microsoft 365 apps preinstalled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ipl3gc"&gt;Windows 11 SE takes a different approach to a Windows edition for schools, and it’s a similar direction where Microsoft was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;originally heading with Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt; before its cancelation. Windows 11 SE will only be available on new low-cost devices and only for schools and education customers. While Windows 11 SE is, naturally, optimized for Microsoft Edge, Office, and Microsoft’s cloud-based services, it’s not restricted to just Microsoft apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQQM9W"&gt;“Windows 11 SE also supports third-party apps, including Zoom and Chrome, because we want to give schools the choice to use what works best for them,” says Paige Johnson, head of Microsoft’s education marketing. IT admins will be in charge of what apps get installed, and devices can be managed to silently update outside of class time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25FNx1"&gt;Most of the Windows 11 SE changes are fairly minor, though. Microsoft has spent the past 18 months talking to teachers and students to get feedback on its efforts to date on low-cost Windows laptops. That feedback has led to apps always launching in fullscreen mode on Windows 11 SE, and Microsoft has removed the multiple Snap Layouts in this edition in favor of a single mode that lets you place apps side by side. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/salytP17uGHvpt2e9QCt8bIvZa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998136/w11SE_snap1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has simplified Snap Layouts in Windows 11 SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M0fKPv"&gt;The new Widgets section of Windows 11 has also been removed in SE, as Microsoft found it’s distracting in a classroom environment. Microsoft Edge will also be configured to accept Chrome extensions, which is turned off by default on Windows 11. Many schools in the US rely on Chrome extensions as part of their Chrome OS usage, so this change is a clear recognition of that. Windows 11 SE also backs up documents to OneDrive by default, with offline support to make it easier for students to use these Windows 11 SE laptops beyond just the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqeCXg"&gt;Windows 11 SE will also ship with a new colorful Bloom wallpaper by default and some changes to the way apps are bundled. While you might experience having two different versions of OneNote or Teams in Windows 11, Microsoft is cleaning this up in Windows 11 SE so only a single version is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYMKAu"&gt;Windows 11 SE will only be available on low-cost laptops that are sold to schools. Acer, Asus, Dell, Dynabook, Fujitsu, HP, JK-IP, Lenovo, and Positivo are all creating Windows 11 SE laptops in the coming months. Microsoft even has its own $249 Surface Laptop SE, which sets the stage for Windows 11 SE. The base model ships with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of eMMC storage, and an 11.6-inch (1366 x 768) display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22535819"&gt;You can read all about the Surface Laptop SE right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWYme5"&gt;The Surface Laptop SE specs demonstrate the type of low-cost devices that will ship with Windows 11 SE. Microsoft tells us it has made a lot of performance improvements tuned towards 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage devices, so hopefully Windows 11 SE holds up well on these low-cost laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MzzG5HslQPelxuONhds7VZNZyYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998137/COMR_Feature_02_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $249 Surface Laptop SE ships with Windows 11 SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vkOmoC"&gt;Windows 11 SE, which according to Microsoft isn’t intended to be short for anything, is also a big part of the company’s overall efforts to compete with Chrome OS. Microsoft has often overlooked what makes Chrome OS so easy to use and manage for IT admins and schools, and Windows 11 SE laptops will now be ready to talk to Microsoft Intune straight away for setup purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6gzE8"&gt;That makes it easier for IT admins to provision these devices with a more simplified backend management console for education. Microsoft is also bundling apps like Teams, Office, OneNote, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft for Education&lt;/em&gt;, and Flipgrid in Windows 11 SE so IT admins don’t have to install them separately. This should make it easier for students to simply open up a Windows 11 SE laptop, type their login information, and instantly get access to their apps and cloud documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCuF0R"&gt;Microsoft is expecting Windows 11 SE laptops to arrive in education channels later this year and into 2022, just as the education buying season begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Register now to better your chances of getting a PS5 for the holidays </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MmEnW-4Pc1dnqOhf9LepojHwgmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116989/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6qp03"&gt;All signs point to Sony’s PlayStation store opening the floodgates for &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;yet another PS5 restock today at 2PM ET / 11AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. Before you get too excited, however, keep in mind that the chances for just anyone to waltz in and get one at that time are low. That’s because this one is apparently being hosted for people who received invites to purchase a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sP2CLT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726198/ps5-playstation-5-sony-console-registration-restock-november-invite"&gt;Sony opened up registration for a PS5 invite in mid-October&lt;/a&gt; and promised that it would host November restocking events for those lucky enough to have been extended an invite. So for today’s restock, it’s likely that those who registered in October are now having their chance to get a console. If you recall registering a while ago, you should check your inbox now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vs8RZ4"&gt;Thankfully, all hope isn’t lost if you’re only getting around to registering now. It’s not a first come, first served kind of thing. Getting an invite is actually based on somewhat murky criteria including previous interests and PlayStation activity. &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/register-to-buy/"&gt;Head to this registration page&lt;/a&gt;, sign in with your PlayStation Network ID, and register. Also, make sure you use the same email you used with your PSN ID to opt in to receive PlayStation marketing emails. &lt;a href="https://id.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/id/management_ca/"&gt;You can do that by heading to this page&lt;/a&gt;, clicking “Notifications” within the list of options, and making sure the box next to “Receive Email Notifications” is checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eehnnZ"&gt;There’s speculation happening that there may be some consoles available to the public from Sony’s site starting at 5PM ET, too, but I’d consider your chances of lucking out to be low at best. Hey, there’s no harm in giving it a shot, at least. Good luck today and later on in November as we get closer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7X8qL8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="e1lR5Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Twitter will now let you pay to undo tweets and read ad-free news in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2o_t4xbqdeOEawW_FnfZCloseEM=/10x0:4311x2867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116939/1_Twitter_Blue_Blue_BG_Undo_Tweet__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter Blue subscribers can undo tweets before they’re sent.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FnjtJ9"&gt;Twitter Blue, the company’s subscription service, is adding new features while expanding to new countries and platforms. The service first launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; in Canada and Australia on iOS, but starting Tuesday, Twitter Blue will be available in the US and New Zealand and on Android and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dUiZf"&gt;Perhaps the most useful Twitter Blue feature is an undo button, which lets you recall tweets before they send. (I can think of a few times that would have saved me from an embarrassing typo.) Other features in the initial launch included a reader mode for tweet threads, bookmarks folders, the ability to theme your Twitter app and app icon, and, as of last month, a Labs program that lets subscribers try out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751003/twitter-blue-subscribers-labs-early-access-features"&gt;some new Twitter features early&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN940E"&gt;But as part of Tuesday’s expansion, Twitter Blue is about to get a lot more useful for people who love reading and finding news on Twitter. One feature lets people view ad-free articles on participating websites &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; gives a portion of revenue from Twitter Blue subscriptions to those sites. If you’re a Twitter Blue subscriber, when you come across a link from a publisher offering ad-free articles, you’ll see an “Ad-free with Twitter Blue” label under the headline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/84vHxro9uKRit4Si9N44FZoe7Xg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22997311/2_Twitter_Blue_Blue_BG_Ad_free_Articles.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the label Twitter Blue subscribers will see for an ad-free article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7u50Ip"&gt;The feature builds off the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;acquisition of Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, which offered similar functionality, and Twitter had said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711233/scroll-shutting-down-twitter-blue-standalone-subscription-ad-free-article-service"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; it would be rolling it into Twitter Blue. More than 300 US-based sites are participating in the program, including &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter, &lt;/em&gt;and, full disclosure, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company says it hopes to include publications from outside the US in the future. And Twitter says it doesn’t change the proportion of money it gives to publishers if you subscribe to Twitter Blue from iOS or Android, which take a cut of digital purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aec0vD"&gt;Twitter Blue’s ad-free articles feature doesn’t let you pass paywalls, Twitter says, so depending on the publication, you might not be able to read some articles even if you’re a Twitter Blue subscriber. And unfortunately, ad-free articles aren’t available on Android right now, and the company didn’t share a timeline for when that might change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irkTvO"&gt;Disappointingly, you’ll still see ads &lt;em&gt;on Twitter&lt;/em&gt; even when you subscribe to Twitter Blue, and don’t hold out hope that an ad-free feed will be arriving anytime soon, if at all. “We are not currently considering a Twitter ads-free product,” Twitter senior director of product Sara Beykpour said in a briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oduboo"&gt;Ad-free articles aren’t the only Scroll feature making a comeback; Twitter Blue will now offer a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/18/5523128/nuzzel-keeps-track-of-twitter-and-facebook-so-you-dont-have-to"&gt;Nuzzel-like&lt;/a&gt; roundup of the most-shared articles from the people you follow called Top Articles that updates every 24 hours. Twitter wound down Nuzzel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;when it bought Scroll&lt;/a&gt; but committed to bringing “core elements” of the product to Twitter at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdrQe0"&gt;The roundup of top articles won’t be an email like Nuzzel was. Instead, you’ll access it on Twitter itself, though it’s only available on Android and the web at the moment. A Twitter spokesperson said it will arrive on iOS “very soon.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2R_Z5hb-KQvH2EVr-_d_Ixfme6A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22997314/3_Twitter_Blue_Blue_BG_Top_Articles.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuzzel is back (sort of) as Top Articles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="43UOZC"&gt;Twitter Blue subscribers will also be able to customize their navigation bar so that you can pin areas of the app that you want to be more easily accessible. Customizing the navigation bar will only be available on iOS to start, and custom themes is an iOS-only feature as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkyCss"&gt;Twitter Blue costs $2.99 per month in the US (or an equivalent price in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand). I wish that it offered a totally ad-free experience, and I don’t like that some individual features are fragmented across platforms, but there’s enough for me to try it for a month and see how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mNAdRK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/2880"&gt;TSMC is teaming up with Sony&lt;/a&gt; (specifically, Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation) on its new $7 billion chip factory in Japan, the companies jointly announced today. The new plant, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726066/tsmc-new-chip-factory-fab-japan-shortage-supply-issues-2022"&gt;as had been previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, will focus not on cutting edge chips but rather older 22nm and 28nm processes in an effort to meet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;supply shortfalls for older chips&lt;/a&gt; have has steadily impacted everything from cars to smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZWsW4"&gt;The new factory had previously been announced last month by TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, although at the time, it had yet to be approved by TSMC’s board of directors. &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-says-it-will-build-first-Japan-chip-plant-with-Sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the board has now approved the new factory under a new subsidiary, Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, Inc. (JASM). Sony’s semiconductor group will invest approximately $0.5 billion in the new subsidiary for less than 20 percent equity in JASM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qsvjog"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TSMC is building a new chip factory in Japan, but warns of ‘tight’ supply through 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726066/tsmc-new-chip-factory-fab-japan-shortage-supply-issues-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Q6yfK7"&gt;For those hoping that the new Japan factory will help ease supply constraints on older chips, it’ll still be some time before the new factory comes online. Construction on the new fab won’t begin until 2022, with production not set to start until “the end of 2024.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6hlto"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; report also notes that TSMC’s board also approved plans to build a new fab in Taiwan that would focus on both advanced 7nm chips, as well as legacy 28nm products, although construction isn’t set to begin until 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3x7Qt"&gt;The new expansions are part of TSMC’s ambitious plans to invest $100 billion through 2023 to build out its chipmaking capabilities even further. TSMC still builds the bulk of its chips in Taiwan, outside of a pair of fabs in China and a small subsidiary (WaferTech) located in Washington state. The new $7 billion Japan fab, along with the already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;planned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-arizona/phoenix-okays-development-deal-with-tsmc-for-12-billion-chip-factory-idUSKBN27Y30E"&gt;$12 billion manufacturing hub in Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, would help to expand TSMC’s reach to new countries, even as the new Taiwan facility continues to shore up its domestic capacity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s talk about the future of USB-C</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jifYPvzANWZm0vHZTdOUXCShpHU=/0x0:1700x1133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116887/USB_Vergecast.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwtM36"&gt;If you’re a longtime listener of &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;then you know that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;USB-C comes up a lot. Anytime our colleague Chaim Gartenberg joins the show, there is going to be a brief aside about the complications of USB-C and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702453/usb-c-pd-240-watt-charging-usb4-data-transfer-logo-branding-standard"&gt;the many varieties of USB-C cables&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dv8z7b"&gt;The reason USB-C can be complicated is that we have one plug that does multiple things — from low power to ridiculously high 240-watt power. From basic data to super high-speed data. Thunderbolt. Display monitors. Audio. The dream of a single cable and plug is great, but it’s also confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KIZLec"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2390085483&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RKDAow"&gt;For today’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, we wanted to take a step back and focus an entire episode on what USB-C is, where it’s at today, and what’s in store for its future. How do we know what cable to buy? Why is there no USB-C on the iPhone? How future proof is USB-C? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVJ4sv"&gt;Of course, to answer some of these questions we had to bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter Chaim Gartenberg. We also talked to Rod Whitby, CTO of Australian Semiconductor Technology Company, who has worked with USB-C since its infancy and attended a number of USB interoperability workshops during the early days of USB-C. Ken Pillonel,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759704/usb-c-iphone-hack-mod-open-source-github-repo-ken-pillonel-design-video"&gt; the hacker who figured out how to replace his iPhone’s Lightning port with USB-C&lt;/a&gt;, also joins the show to discuss his project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HE4cNE"&gt;You can think of this episode as a &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; reference guide for the next time we cover the intricacies of USB-C on the podcast. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch review: bad timing</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Decent hardware saddled with old and tired software&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fRJuEu"&gt;The kindest thing I can say about the new $299 Gen 6 iteration of Fossil’s long-running smartwatch series is this: it’s not entirely Fossil’s fault that it’s bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5WYHB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-and-googles-secrecy-wear-os-3-has-foiled-its-success-year"&gt;company reportedly learned&lt;/a&gt; that Google and Samsung had teamed up to finally revitalize the Wear OS software Fossil’s been using at the same time we did: this past May at Google IO. And so Fossil’s 2021 smartwatch lineup is running software that hasn’t been meaningfully improved since at least 2019 and it won’t receive the latest software until late 2022. Samsung has smartwatches that run on Wear OS 3 and do so competently, Fossil is stuck on Wear OS 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCft8D"&gt;Running old software is not inherently a bad thing — old software is often battle tested, reliable, and fast. Sadly, none of those adjectives apply here and Fossil compounded Wear OS 2’s issues by cramming in features it’s unable to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLnjyp"&gt;It’s an ugly situation for a handsome watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="08m78j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10853249"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yzQtJB"&gt;Fossil’s Gen 6 smartwatches come in a few different styles that are all built around a single design. It has a 44mm round casing with a 1.28-inch round OLED screen. There are two buttons flanking the main center crown, which also can be rotated to scroll around on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsTHq3"&gt;I like the look of the Gen 6 watch, but I also have always had a soft spot for larger watches — even though my wrists are on the smaller side. Fossil may not be taking any risks with the design, but it has just enough character to look nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68q1RJ"&gt;Battery life has been a bit of a disappointment. It can get through a day and to the next morning if I don’t push the watch with exercise tracking, but it doesn’t take too much use to send me looking for a charger well before bed. There are a few different power modes — and if you really want you can dig in further and turn off specific features to eke out more battery life. If there’s a bright spot, it’s charging. Since Fossil is using direct-contact pogo pins that connect more securely than older models, it’s able to juice up fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2zqSa"&gt;Fossil had filled out the sensor array to match what you can get from other popular smartwatches, including a blood oxygen monitor — though it doesn’t have an EKG monitor like competing watches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="s3zowX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A smartwatch out of time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Fossil Gen 6 is a large watch, but looks good on my wrist" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8NsSJOuLXuZQT6diYSek0oTbq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996110/dbohn_211105_4864_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fossil Gen 6 is a large watch, but it looks good on my wrist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yz221P"&gt;Unfortunately, having the sensors isn’t the same thing as offering the health tracking. Google Fit is woefully behind Apple Health in its features and Fossil itself is not set up to offer its own health apps. The result is that while you can take individual readings wherever, putting them together into a holistic picture is a hassle at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSjZM9"&gt;Worse: even taking those readings is a pain. Using Fossil’s watchface to launch the sleep tracking stats or blood oxygen monitor involves tapping and then waiting to see if your tap worked, then tapping again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TX0rS"&gt;The root of these problems is easy to identify: Wear OS 2 simply isn’t up to the task of supporting all the advanced features Fossil wants to add, even with a newer Qualcomm processor that adds a low-power chip to help with battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYHXCp"&gt;Wear OS 2 can’t set multiple timers, sometimes scrolling with the crown simply doesn’t work, and Fossil has had to try to spackle over feature gaps with its own apps. I do like that you can download and install third-party watchfaces, but that’s small comfort. Wear OS 2 is a mess of confusing permissions, lag, and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Fossil Gen 6 is a shame — good hardware undone by old software" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wskAVT771dSZxgvWAEKuK33Keow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996111/dbohn_211105_4864_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fossil Gen 6 is a shame — good hardware undone by old software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aX2wQO"&gt;In previous years with previous Wear OS watches, I would often land on a feeling that if you used it for simple things like notifications and counting steps, it would be possible to justify getting one. But the reality is that if you’re on Android and you just want those basics, there are smartwatches with much simpler operating systems that last longer on a charge. You won’t get mapping or apps like Spotify — but using those apps on this watch hardly feels worth the effort most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxAjfS"&gt;Sometime in 2022, there is supposed to be a software update which will bring the newer Wear OS 3 to the Fossil Gen 6 watches. When that happens, I’ll be curious to see if these watches perform better. Until then, the best alternative is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, which is running Google’s newer software. But Samsung’s watch uses Samsung’s digital assistant and Samsung’s apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUXdlJ"&gt;It’s all a shame. Fossil has put together some nice hardware here, with all of the pieces necessary to make a really good watch. But it’s had to glue those pieces together with software that Google had already abandoned before Fossil was able to announce the Gen 6 was coming. Maybe next time, Google and Fossil will be able to synchronize their watch efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
