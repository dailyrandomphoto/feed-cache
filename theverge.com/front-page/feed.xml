    <title>GM drops wireless charging from some SUVs due to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yXjN59R86Cm54_OO8v9hmeLK6FY=/41x0:1240x799/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69577616/2021_Chevrolet_Traverse_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hi5U8G"&gt;General Motors is dropping wireless smartphone charging from some new SUVs because of the global microchip shortage. It’s the latest feature to get the axe at the company due to the low supply of semiconductors, as GM has already &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41307/gm-pulls-hd-radio-from-2021-silverado-and-sierra-pickups-over-chip-shortage"&gt;pulled HD radio from some models&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/41008/gm-drops-auto-stop-start-from-v8-silverados-and-sierras-due-to-chip-shortage"&gt;auto start-stop&lt;/a&gt; and a fuel management module that made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;pickup trucks slightly cleaner and more efficient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAx3Mz"&gt;Certain trims of the 2021 Chevy Tahoe and Suburban, as well as the 2021 GMC Yukon, made after July 12th will no longer include a wireless charging pad, as was first reported by the &lt;a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/07/2021-full-size-gm-suvs-to-lose-wireless-phone-charger/"&gt;GM Authority blog&lt;/a&gt;. But GM tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that certain 2022 Buick Enclaves, Chevy Traverses, and Cadillac XT5s and XT6s made after August 2nd are also affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4Za6t"&gt;Buyers of these vehicles will get a $75 credit instead of the wireless charging option. (GM is offering a similar $50 credit for vehicles that are missing the HD radio feature.) The company is expected to make these vehicles without wireless charging pads through the rest of the respective model years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91BMM0"&gt;“Our supply chain organization continues to make strides working with our supply base to mitigate the near-term impacts of the semiconductor situation,” the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “GM continues to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including our highly profitable full-size trucks and SUVs for our customers. However, the semiconductor situation continues to remain fluid globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hnemi"&gt;The chip shortage is wreaking all sorts of havoc in the auto industry. Some companies have chosen to reduce overall production as a result, like Ford, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;shuttered some F-150 assembly lines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xjRLVj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The chip shortage is wreaking all sorts of havoc in the auto industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvT5BT"&gt;The resulting lack of supply is driving up prices, though, creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;an extremely hot new car market&lt;/a&gt;. So many automakers like GM are still trying to get vehicles to dealers even if they’re missing some features. Nissan, for instance, is making &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3132505/carmakers-are-stripping-out-digital-bells-and-whistles-global"&gt;some vehicles without navigation systems&lt;/a&gt;. Some new Ram pickups no longer come with an intelligent rear-view mirror that improves blind spot monitoring. French automaker Renault is shipping some cars with a smaller entertainment screen and has also dropped wireless charging from certain models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwyUKA"&gt;There are a number of things driving the chip shortage, but many automakers made the situation worse for themselves when they initially lowered production targets in 2020 because of the pandemic. When sales rebounded quickly, they found themselves in a position where chips that &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; getting made were now going elsewhere. Automakers are especially vulnerable because they tend to use older, larger semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCXlz1"&gt;It may only get worse, too. While some automakers were initially optimistic that the harshest impact would be felt in the first half of 2021, Volkswagen recently warned that the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagen-sees-global-chip-shortage-worsening-in-second-half-11625861486"&gt;second half of this year could be brutal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgRRAQ"&gt;In May, Ford CEO Jim Farley &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"&gt;said on an episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company is considering going directly to the chip makers to cut deals, as opposed to going through suppliers. “I think boots on the ground in places like Taiwan and China and Asia are going to be more important for us,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVWZj7"&gt;Farley also said that, moving forward, he thinks his company “[has] to move to 22nm or smaller, more advanced [semiconductors], more importantly, we have to be in a position to know inside the company what to choose and customize off the shelf computes to work for us.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord buys AI anti-harassment company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wyQRuJ6HS4oNpD52YXn1hL-tZsI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69577524/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lh7aG2"&gt;Discord has &lt;a href="https://medium.com/sentropy/sentropy-x-discord-1ed5c4269896"&gt;purchased a company&lt;/a&gt; working on AI tools to help detect harassment online. The company, Sentropy, monitors online networks for abuse and harassment, then offers users a way to block problematic users and filter out messages they don’t want to see. Its first product, Sentropy Protect, was initially focused on &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentropy-launches-tool-for-people-to-protect-themselves-from-social-media-abuse-starting-with-twitter/"&gt;helping users clean up their Twitter feeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igHY7h"&gt;The company is now shutting down its independent tools and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/sentropy/sentropy-x-discord-1ed5c4269896"&gt;joining Discord&lt;/a&gt;, where it plans to help the hugely popular chat app “expand and evolve its [trust and safety] capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6N7s8"&gt;It could be a good pairing. Discord has a huge network, with more than 150 million monthly users, and servers can be a real challenge to moderate. The service is made up of more than 19 million individual communities, and that scale requires the work of both &lt;a href="https://discord.com/moderation"&gt;volunteers&lt;/a&gt; and teams within Discord to properly moderate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6zpJz"&gt;Tools like the ones Sentropy built could help both groups better monitor for bad behavior on the networks they oversee. Discord will use the acquisition to expand its abilities to detect and remove bad content and grow its safety team, according to a company spokesperson. They said trust and safety is a “key priority” for Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quibi’s zombie corpse rises again to claim eight Emmy nominations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cqpOc_qNw6Xez1eRb3N0TLMuwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69577421/acastro_200403_3960_quibi_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="175MLE"&gt;Quibi wasn’t long for this world, but its spirit refuses to let us move on from its chaotic memory. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529392/quibi-shut-down-date-december-tv-shows-movies-streaming"&gt;shutting down in December&lt;/a&gt;, the doomed streaming service scooped up several Emmy nominations today for its shortform originals across three categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVlUuB"&gt;The service received &lt;a href="https://www.emmys.com/sites/default/files/Downloads/73rd-nominations-network-v1.pdf?q=1&amp;amp;q1="&gt;eight nominations&lt;/a&gt; for three of its series, including &lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mapleworth Murders&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Reno 911! &lt;/em&gt;As was the case when a handful of Quibi originals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/21345262/quibi-emmy-award-short-form-nominations-strategy-competition-streaming"&gt;were nominated&lt;/a&gt; for Emmy awards last year, the service cleaned up in shortform content categories, which makes a lot of sense considering it doesn’t exactly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/21345262/quibi-emmy-award-short-form-nominations-strategy-competition-streaming"&gt;have a ton of competition&lt;/a&gt; in the arena. Its nominations by category are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bLCaOf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Actor in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOp92n"&gt;Pete Devon in &lt;em&gt;Bonding&lt;/em&gt; (Netflix)&lt;br&gt;Kevin Hart in &lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt; (Quibi)&lt;br&gt;John Travolta in &lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt; (Quibi)&lt;br&gt;John Lutz in &lt;em&gt;Mapleworth Murders&lt;/em&gt; (Quibi)&lt;br&gt;J.B. Smoove in &lt;em&gt;Mapleworth Murders&lt;/em&gt; (Quibi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VKqWY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Actress in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McOsgm"&gt;Nathalie Emmanuel in &lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt; (Quibi)&lt;br&gt;Keke Palmer in &lt;em&gt;Keke Palmer’s Turnt Up With The Taylors&lt;/em&gt; (Facebook Watch)&lt;br&gt;Paula Pell in &lt;em&gt;Mapleworth Murders&lt;/em&gt; (Quibi)&lt;br&gt;Kerri Kenney-Silver in &lt;em&gt;Reno 911!&lt;/em&gt; (Quibi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdVzTI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Short Form Comedy, Drama or Variety Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQHTmD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carpool Karaoke: The Series&lt;/em&gt; (Apple TV)&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Late Night With Seth Meyers: CORRECTIONS&lt;/em&gt; (YouTube)&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Randy Rainbow Show&lt;/em&gt; (YouTube)&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reno 911! &lt;/em&gt;(Quibi)&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Colbert Presents Tooning Out The News&lt;/em&gt; (Paramount+)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8SFp4t"&gt;After Quibi called it quits last year, many of Quibi’s originals were scooped up and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395533/roku-originals-quibi-content-tv"&gt;rebranded as Roku Originals&lt;/a&gt; for the platform’s free and ad-supported service the Roku Channel. Unlike the original platform, Roku will not stream them with Quibi’s Turnstyle formatting, which adjusted the viewer’s point of view based on the orientation of their phone. Roku announced earlier this year that 75-plus originals would come out on the service this year, including a dozen previously unreleased shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OehS9g"&gt;Quibi had thrown mountains of money behind wooing A-list celebrities and talent for its series. While Roku is unlikely to pump the same amount of money into the future development of many of the shows it acquired in its Quibi deal, it does appear to be willing to cough up enough cash to produce future entries of the content haul’s crown jewels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="604CsG"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210608005476/en/Roku-Orders-Second-Season-of-Kevin-Hart%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98Die-Hart%E2%80%99-from-Laugh-Out-Loud"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was ordering a second season of Kevin Hart’s &lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt; titled &lt;em&gt;Die Harter&lt;/em&gt;. Colin Davis, Roku’s head of original scripted programming, said in a statement at the time that the series “exploded out of the gate and after a spectacular debut weekend, has quickly become one of the most watched Roku Originals on The Roku Channel” after premiering on May 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New report suggests corporate climate change pledges aren’t that valuable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A trader monitors offers in the Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor’s 500 stock index options pit at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) on August 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xxa08oRo8sJt9IY6Gow9eWztFsg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69577379/485109234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A trader monitors offers in the Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s 500 stock index options pit at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) on August 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7c3Snm"&gt;Many S&amp;amp;P 100 companies that claim to care about climate change are either ignoring or derailing policies that could provide solutions to the crisis, a new report finds. A whopping 92 percent of companies on the S&amp;amp;P 100 index in 2019 have pledged to cut down their own planet-heating emissions, but just 40 percent are actually pushing lawmakers to address the climate crisis, and 21 percent have advocated against science-based climate policy over the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jKCOuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Corporations and lawmakers alike will need to do much more to meet the scale and urgency of the climate crisis&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yK1YTK"&gt;So while companies might sell themselves to consumers as planet-friendly, they’re not necessarily having the same conversations with decision-makers who are most responsible for tackling the crisis. Netflix, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22353098/netflix-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-goals"&gt;plans to slash its greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; dramatically by the end of next year, but the streaming giant has yet to publicly advocate for any specific science-based climate policies, &lt;a href="https://www.ceres.org/practicingRPE/netflix"&gt;according to Ceres&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XD7zsn"&gt;Corporations and lawmakers alike will need to do much more to meet the scale and urgency of the climate crisis. Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that global greenhouse gas emissions need to drop to essentially zero within a few decades to avoid a future on Earth to which life will struggle to adapt. But proposals by the Biden administration to overhaul US infrastructure and make the economy cleaner and greener are &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-braces-hell-fight-over-bidens-infrastructure-plan-2021-07-12/"&gt;stalling&lt;/a&gt; in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn7Uzr"&gt;It could also be bad for business for companies fail to live up to their climate pledges, says the nonprofit group Ceres that published the report. “Those companies that are not actively lobbying for science-based climate policies are effectively working against themselves, making it extremely challenging for them to achieve the bold targets they have set to clean up their own business operations, risking both their reputations and their financial performance,” Steven Rothstein, Ceres managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, said in a statement. After all, companies are facing &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures"&gt;mounting financial risks from climate catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;. Oatly, while not an S&amp;amp;P 100 company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392621/oatly-climate-change-monoculture-risk-factors-ipo"&gt;recently disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that its oats are vulnerable to climate-induced disasters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2bQ2fH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies have flip-flopped on climate change &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NLGlmL"&gt;Some companies have flip-flopped on climate change over the past several years, especially as political winds changed. Twelve of the companies Ceres assessed have both lobbied for and against policies aimed at stopping climate change. Take Ford: it previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14425792/ford-trump-fuel-economy-standards-risk-million-us-jobs"&gt;supported Trump’s efforts&lt;/a&gt; to weaken fuel efficiency standards. But it switched sides to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;back California’s stricter standards in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and then announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21300974/ford-carbon-neutral-2050-climate-change-fuel-efficiency"&gt;reach carbon neutrality&lt;/a&gt; — cutting down and offsetting all of its emissions — by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nkz6hr"&gt;Other companies are guilty of climate inaction by association, according to the report. About three-quarters of S&amp;amp;P 100 companies are members of the US Chamber of Commerce, which Ceres says “has long resisted the policies the nation needs to make its economy more sustainable.” Apple is the only company Ceres assessed that abandoned the chamber over its position on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZDakL"&gt;Protesting inaction might be just what the US Chamber of Commerce and companies need to make changes. It’s not just Apple. Companies are facing more pressure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166275/climate-change-new-label-brands-neutral-certified"&gt;consumers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399329/amazon-shareholders-plastic-packaging-waste-pollution"&gt;activist shareholders&lt;/a&gt; who are concerned about the environment. Shareholders have even recently pushed fossil fuel companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455387/big-oil-gas-shell-exxon-chevron-climate-change"&gt;Chevron and Exxon&lt;/a&gt; to hasten efforts to work more sustainably. There are plenty of ways to push for change, and every strategy will likely have to play a role in saving the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmZSab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is working on Apple Pay Later to help you buy things without paying for them yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0xgJX3lgPdkm7BYKRsOH2akz8oA=/201x0:2349x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69577207/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.49.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqoVTD"&gt;Even if you haven’t signed up for the Apple Card, you may soon be able to put your purchases on Apple’s tab. Apple is teaming up with Goldman Sachs yet again to turn every Apple Pay transaction into a potential “buy now, pay later” opportunity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — no Apple Card needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RIe9Z"&gt;You know how many online checkout counters across the web tempt you to pay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/23/16516792/affirm-mobile-app-lending-money-launch-virtual-credit-card"&gt;with Affirm&lt;/a&gt; or Klarna or PayPal’s Pay In 4 instead of coughing up the full purchase price at the start,  then they charge you in installments instead? It sounds like this Apple service will be a direct competitor — with the important distinction that this will be baked into hundreds of millions of Apple devices that many people are already using to tap to pay at gobs of physical stores, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tLQjC"&gt;You’ll pay in four interest-free installments over two weeks if you pick “Apple Pay in 4” or pay interest over several months if you pick “Apple Pay Monthly Installments,” writes &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg. &lt;/em&gt;It adds&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no credit check required, and some plans won’t have late fees. The publication doesn’t say when Apple might launch the service or how much interest it might charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PgBgW"&gt;Apple putting people in debt feels like the ultimate form of lock-in, and it might rub some the wrong way, but the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282946/apple-card-credit-post-iphone-strategy-services-business-digital-wallet-payments"&gt;a knack for sprucing up boring products in the pursuit of services revenue&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s true of Apple Pay Later the way it was true of the Apple Card, there’ll likely be plenty of people who will take Apple’s slightly friendlier terms over the financial industry’s status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fhbue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram launches Security Checkup for people whose accounts have been hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three phone screens showing Instagram tabs titled “Security Checkup” that include prompts to review contact info, connected accounts, and profile information. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sh3llJMsrshF-hVRhcNutAMXZdw=/26x0:1556x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576865/206777573_332496735079286_5739390584905507635_n.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram’s Security Checkup&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/keeping-instagram-safe-and-secure?ref=shareable" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DyCz8a"&gt;Instagram introduced a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/keeping-instagram-safe-and-secure?ref=shareable"&gt;new security check&lt;/a&gt; today for any people whose accounts have been hacked before. People with previously compromised accounts will see a prompt when they log in asking if they want to start a security checkup. The feature walks users through security steps, including confirming other accounts that share login information, reviewing login activity, and keeping recovery contact information updated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93qCDz"&gt;Instagram is also planning to add support for two-factor authentication through WhatsApp, in addition to its current options of phone numbers and authenticator apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTyNWh"&gt;Instagram says there’s been an uptick in accounts claiming to be Instagram in direct messages to get people to share their passwords. Instagram only sends emails, and you can check to see if an email’s authentic by looking at the “Emails from Instagram” tab in settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfvcSC"&gt;The streamlined security feature is rolling out in the middle of &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/25/dont-let-these-easy-to-get-back-on-instagram-emails-freak-you-out-your-account-hasnt-been-hacked/"&gt;a recent wave&lt;/a&gt; of password reset emails that have been cluttering some people’s inboxes. The emails are legitimately from Instagram and are likely from bots trying to access a bunch of accounts at once. They’re annoying if you get several of them at a time, but they don’t mean your account has been hacked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches its Workspace tier for individuals in five countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHlLRwU0WKURBAB4BRMWMZSt4i8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576815/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WfFASK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://workspace.google.com/individual/"&gt;Google Workspace Individual&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s Workspace plan designed to give one-person businesses access to some premium features in the software suite, is now available in five countries (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/12/google-workspace-individual-launch/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbHi5m"&gt;With Workspace Individual, you’ll be able to host group meetings in Google Meet for longer than 60 minutes on a computer as well as record Meet calls and use noise cancellation. Workspace Individual also makes it easy to let others schedule time on your Google Calendar, thanks to shareable booking pages. And professional and customizable email layouts in Gmail are “coming soon” to the Workspace tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9nXXO"&gt;Workspace Individual is available if you live in Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the US, according to a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-workspace-individual/answer/10758004?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=10713204"&gt;Google support doc&lt;/a&gt;, and you can try it out now at no cost with a 14-day free trial. When it comes time to pay, the plan typically costs $9.99 per month, but through January 2022, Google is knocking $2 off the monthly price, meaning you’ll pay $7.99 per month instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can’t make fun of Gogo’s airline internet anymore — because it changed the name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zftWfZHDW7hZo-cDgVeSY6WGcY=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576791/gogo-internet-logo-stock1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dX9IuI"&gt;If you’ve ever purchased inflight Wi-Fi in the United States, there’s a good chance you’ve cursed Gogo’s name. But now, you’ll have to direct your anger at Intelsat instead: &lt;a href="https://www.intelsat.com/newsroom/gogo-commercial-aviation-is-now-intelsat/"&gt;it’s the new name of the consumer chunk of the inflight internet company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGcK4y"&gt;Technically, Intelsat is also the name of that chunk’s owner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410368/gogo-sells-inflight-internet-business-intelsat-bankrupt"&gt;a bankrupt satellite operator that purchased the inflight internet’s consumer brand in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when both companies were struggling with the realities of travel at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gogo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21230133/gogo-furloughs-60-percent-workforce-passenger-air-travel-collapse"&gt;furloughed 60 percent of its workforce&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350251/gogo-layoffs-furloughs-airlines-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;laid off 14 percent of its workers&lt;/a&gt; that July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKZwiF"&gt;The Gogo brand will likely still live on &lt;a href="https://ir.gogoair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gogo-offer-business-aviations-first-unlimited-streaming-and-data"&gt;for “business aviation,”&lt;/a&gt; however, as Gogo Business Aviation, LLC is now a separate company with its “Gogo Biz” offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btJC0b"&gt;If you’ve had a crappy consumer Gogo experience, it may have been due to airlines not keeping the service up and running — I certainly remember a few flights where they never turned it on as planned — but it may have also been the limitations of Gogo’s aging technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C1dBJG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not all Gogo was equal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1qxfq"&gt;The company relies on both a network of ground-to-air cellular towers and satellite connections to work, both of which can be spotty and slow: the cellular towers, in particular, only deliver a 3G cellular connection that has to be shared across the entire plane, one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/12/3636842/gogo-atg-4-in-flight-internet"&gt;topped out at 9.8Mbps per aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. While Gogo Biz was serving &lt;a href="https://www.ainonline.com/sponsored-content/business-aviation/2020-06-10/power-five-gogo-avance-hits-five-key-aspects-inflight-connectivity"&gt;some 900 private aircraft&lt;/a&gt; with 4G by June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325999/gogo-5g-network-delay-chip-shortage"&gt;its 5G plans have been delayed till 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5AgzN"&gt;For consumers, the service’s 2Ku satellite connections have been far faster at up to 100Mbps per plane, but it still depends on how many passengers are using it: in 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/gogo-2ku-airplane-wifi-pictures/7/"&gt;I managed to hit 15Mbps and use the internet on four simultaneous devices&lt;/a&gt; aboard a Gogo test flight, but that was with only a handful of journalists aboard the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoUkZI"&gt;Intelsat will compete with other established satellite providers and possibly with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink&lt;/a&gt;, too. Last month, Starlink’s VP &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526601/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-internet-talks-commercial-airlines-in-flight-wifi"&gt;publicly revealed SpaceX is in talks with several airlines&lt;/a&gt; and is designing its own airborne antennas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google slashes Stadia’s revenue share to try to attract developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TmPR7HBxHP07UkssT35ddEot3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576554/akrales_191113_3779_0284.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PLMLVP"&gt;Google is revising how much of a cut it takes from Stadia games in a bid to try to attract more developers. Starting on October 1st, Google will take 15 percent of sales up to $3 million through the end of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oJa4Vi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0oNK-XHp0I?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=319&amp;amp;start=319" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6iQcy"&gt;With the change, Google seems to be trying to make its cloud gaming platform a more enticing option for developers — a proposition that has likely become much harder since the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its own in-house studios&lt;/a&gt;. Google has also tried offering exclusive games to try to bring developers on board (which it presumably paid hefty sums to acquire), but many of those games &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/16/stadia-exclusive-games-available-xbox-playstation-nintendo/"&gt;have since been released on other platforms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0pfrs"&gt;The news comes as revenue shares between developers and platform holders have come under intense scrutiny as of late. Google’s change with Stadia isn’t the first it’s made recently for its stores: the company reduced its Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1 million in annual revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. That move followed a similar one from Apple in November, which announced that developers who earn less than $1 million per year on the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;would qualify for a program&lt;/a&gt; where Apple would take a 15 percent cut of their revenues instead of the standard 30 percent fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63jMJF"&gt;Tuesday’s news was announced at the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0oNK-XHp0I&amp;amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIb7hcy-YBGDlCxq8LyRdVA&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;Google for Games Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the event, on Monday, Google announced that Android 12 will let you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573033/google-android-12-games-download-dashboard-developer-summit"&gt;play games as you’re downloading them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just launched an official $99 MagSafe battery pack for the iPhone 12 lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEfRxBW8iTYh7R0OOqdpnq9_tFI=/0x30:2052x1398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576513/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_9.56.00_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4KJcDV"&gt;Apple has launched the MagSafe Battery Pack for its iPhone 12 lineup. One of the magnetic batteries costs $99, and you can order one &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. For me, the website is showing delivery between July 22nd and July 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPH0mk"&gt;Apple has released battery cases for iPhones in the past, but the new pack attaches to the iPhone 12 phones thanks to embedded magnets. And it will work with all four of the phones in the iPhone 12 family — the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARo_k-GReC54LvtfihaLu6EYvzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715091/MJWY3_AV1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One side of the MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6AepQM"&gt;While the iPhone 11 battery cases had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974475/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-camera-smart-battery-case-shortcut-button"&gt;physical camera shortcut button&lt;/a&gt;, since this accessory is just an attachable pack, that means it doesn’t come with any other features for your phone besides giving you some extra juice. But if it works like the MagSafe wireless charger, you might also be able to use the pack to top up your AirPods or other devices that support Qi wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHGFx6"&gt;Apple says the pack charges with up to 5W of power, so it won’t be the fastest way to charge your phone. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;In a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Apple also says the battery requires iOS 14.7 — a software update that’s not out yet. Since Apple’s website is showing delivery times for the battery pack for as early as July 22nd, it seems like that update will be out soon to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u31Zpm"&gt;Apple also offers a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0E3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-arizona%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wallet that can stick magnetically onto the back of your phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwn2Mg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 13th, 1:14PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added details of charging speed and that the pack requires iOS 14.7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
