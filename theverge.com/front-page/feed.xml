    <title>Jake Gyllenhaal on the challenges of acting over Zoom in Netflix’s thriller The Guilty</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x293Ad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; was always going to be a challenging project. The movie, which is a remake of a Danish film from 2018, follows a 911 dispatcher in Los Angeles, who receives a troubling call that appears to be from a woman who has been abducted. The result is a tense thriller, but one you see almost none of — the entire movie is centered on LAPD officer Joe Baylor, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, as he fields phone calls in an office over the course of a single evening. Because of this, the movie hinges on Gyllenhaal’s performance, as he slowly unravels while the story twists and turns in disturbing ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq0Hlw"&gt;But it became even more challenging thanks to pandemic-related restrictions on filming. While the actors were on set, director Antoine Fuqua, who previously worked with Gyllenhaal on the boxing drama &lt;em&gt;Southpaw&lt;/em&gt;, was in a van a block away, directing remotely. Meanwhile, everyone on the other end of the phone — which includes the likes of Peter Sarsgaard and Ethan Hawke — was working from home. Production on &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; ended up relying on a mishmash of various forms of communication, from FaceTime to Zoom to plain old walkie-talkies. “We had to discover, and were constantly trying to learn as we went,” Gyllenhaal tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think we got a system down on day 11 — and then we were done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32b1z1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaB_ERMAZu4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sXmCaz"&gt;The filming setup was complicated. Because someone close to Fuqua tested positive, he was forced to sit in a van that was hardwired to the set and outfitted with all of the gadgets he’d need to direct. “I had monitors and computers and walkie-talkies and spycams,” he says. From here he had a bird’s-eye view of the set and was able to talk to his first assistant director and other staff via a walkie. Meanwhile, all of the actors who were calling in remotely would be on Zoom in the background so they could hear everything going on and communicate in real time. In moments where more personal or intimate notes were required, Fuqua and Gyllenhaal would hop on FaceTime to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T4Nsn"&gt;The closest the actor and director ever got to face-to-face communication was, well, a little unorthodox. “When we were in a setup change — a lighting change that would take more than 20 minutes or something — I’d go outside and I’d climb this ladder that was on the wall, and Antoine would open the door to his van, and like Romeo and Juliet we would talk from afar; me on the top of this wall on a ladder and him on the street,” says Gyllenhaal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2mZoDZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It leaves less room for something feeling alive.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGKt0w"&gt;Beyond the logistical challenges, all of these different ways of communicating — in particular Zoom — had an impact on the actual performances. “We were a slave to a particular technology, which was Zoom,” Gyllenhaal explains. “And that creates a rhythm. Even in our introductions, we would come on, and you don’t want to interrupt someone. That’s the essence of acting: rhythm. When your rhythm is dictated to you by a technological thing, it leaves less room for something feeling alive. And we had to navigate that for the first four or five days. It was like someone took a quarter of a second out of my instinct. And if you’re a professional at whatever you do, acting in particular, rhythm is everything. Ask a quarterback, you take a quarter of a second away from their throw, that means the difference between missing or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuJWDB"&gt;Midway through &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a seemingly minor location change, when Gyllenhaal’s character moves from a busy office full of other dispatchers to an empty room across the hall so he could be alone. From the viewer’s perspective, the change doesn’t seem like a big deal. It’s just a man walking from one desk to another. But given all of the restrictions on set, the shift in location made a huge difference for the actors and production team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N7uLvb"&gt;“We were all racing towards that small room,” says Gyllenhaal. “We were all desperate to get the character in that small room where he was alone because it meant we could move away from having everyone together in a big room with extras moving about. It was almost like, can we get through the first two days safe, and then we don’t have everyone interacting as much. We have people in the background through glass walls. I remember that very specifically. Let’s get through those first two days and we can feel a little safer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnmlda"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Let’s get through those first two days and we can feel a little safer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sh1DR3"&gt;(One of the few silver linings was that it was relatively easy to get other actors on board. “Everyone was at home and everyone wanted to work,” says Gyllenhaal. “So we made all of these phone calls and got incredible actors.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSc0FR"&gt;For the most part, these COVID-related challenges aren’t noticeable in the final product, aside from the fact that no one ever seems to get close to each other, even in such close quarters. &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly tense despite the fact that you’re mostly just watching a man talk on the phone. Part of that has to do with the story, which goes in all sorts of wild, often uncomfortable, directions. But it also comes down to Gyllenhaal’s performance. For him, one of the biggest obstacles in this role was something that a lot of us have had to deal with during the pandemic. “I did have a hard time sitting still,” he says. “It’s hard to create intensity, to generate energy, after 10 hours of sitting in a chair listening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXkRME"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Guilty &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is coming to select theaters on September 24th and will stream on Netflix on October 1st.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I wish Microsoft made an Xbox or Surface gaming laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRiPlDNiiZYsygMeB2MxrPFk2zo=/0x96:2276x1613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897565/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Gaming.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOIk3U"&gt;I’ve been waiting years for Microsoft to make a gaming laptop, and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt; still misses the mark. Whether it would be an Xbox laptop or a Surface one, Microsoft has never really come close to building something truly designed for gaming on the go. The Surface Book, Surface Pro, and Surface Laptop all serve different creator types, but none really cater to gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpvPgR"&gt;It feels like a missed opportunity, particularly when Microsoft calls Windows 11 “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fKjd_pmQpQM"&gt;the best Windows ever for gaming&lt;/a&gt;,” and the market for gaming laptops has become increasingly lucrative in recent years. Barely a month goes by without a thin and cool gaming laptop being announced, and the line separating laptops from gaming laptops is increasingly blurring thanks to advances in chip designs and cooling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oDlJO"&gt;Microsoft has never marketed the Surface Book as a gaming laptop, but the Surface Laptop Studio comes as close as Microsoft has ever come to embracing PC gaming on a Surface. “Elevate your PC gaming,” says Microsoft on its Surface Laptop Studio product page, adding that the device allows you to “play the latest games with graphics that rival reality.” Microsoft also markets the device with people playing Xbox Game Pass for PC games on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIN7WADgz9-tbwyuXTEFMuR95fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871773/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Gaming_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft markets the Surface Laptop Studio for gaming on the go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fUHPni"&gt;I was hoping the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, a successor to the Surface Book, might capitalize on the interest in gaming laptops. Unfortunately, Microsoft has picked one of the weakest Nvidia GPUs available right now, the RTX 3050 Ti. It can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price"&gt;deliver 60fps gameplay&lt;/a&gt; in some modern games at 1080p, but it won’t come close to hitting the 120fps needed to make use of the 120Hz panel without seriously knocking game settings down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2HTpn"&gt;I wish Microsoft had gone a step further and added options for an RTX 3070 or RTX 3080. The Surface Laptop Studio supports up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB SSD storage, and it ships with Intel’s 11th Gen Core H processors, so it’s more than capable of gaming with the right GPU. It even has Thunderbolt 4 support, so you could buy an eGPU and attach it for gaming, but you shouldn’t really &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to do that to get the best performance on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peomlg"&gt;Microsoft has come close to putting a good GPU inside the Surface Book for years, but the company has always shied away from going full gaming laptop. First there was the Surface Book with its GeForce 940M, then the Surface Book with a Performance Base that upgraded the GPU to a GeForce 965M. Neither were suitable for gaming, but the Surface Book 2 delivered a GTX 1060 on the 15-inch version, which was capable of running a variety of games if you were willing to turn the settings down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDRBDtfHNKZep3_AN9z1jaidTzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003705/twarren_200522_4035_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Book has always come close to embracing PC gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rY7zpM"&gt;The Surface Book 2 was never really designed for gaming, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658466/microsoft-surface-book-2-review"&gt;During my review&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed performance issues due to throttling and problems with the power supply keeping the device fully charged. Microsoft moved to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271735/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-15-inch-screen-size-specs-features-price"&gt;GTX 1660Ti Max-Q on the Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt; and addressed the charging issues, but there were still issues around the dGPU disconnecting randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aR0Md"&gt;Microsoft has always struggled to really embrace the PC gaming platform in general, though. While most people use Windows for PC games, it’s Valve’s Steam that they interact with, not the Microsoft Store or Microsoft’s Xbox apps. Microsoft’s many PC gaming failures (let’s not mention Games for Windows Live) have contributed to a lack of focus, and the company’s UWP experiment for Xbox Game Studios titles has just been a headache for installs, updates, and even during gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl5AFD"&gt;So it’s really no surprise Microsoft is hesitant to embrace the PC gaming with its own hardware, even if it does some great DirectX work in the background to improve PC game performance and underlying APIs for developers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV0NwZlhNDLFkL4tveBBROKygM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871772/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Internals_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Surface Laptop Studio only has an RTX 3050 Ti inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9t2gwq"&gt;PC gaming is now in a moment of transformation for gaming on the go. There have been a few options for Nintendo Switch-like devices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; has thrust the idea into the mainstream. The miniature PC is powered by Linux and, if successful, it could help break the reliance on Windows for PC gaming. Perhaps Microsoft’s even thinking about its own Xbox handheld, as the AMD components Valve is using inside the Steam Deck are also available for competitors to make their own mobile gaming PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa43VO"&gt;Either way, I just wish Microsoft would take PC gaming more seriously both within Windows and with its Xbox / Surface hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;Gaming laptops are no longer bulky and garish&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d love to see what Microsoft could produce if it truly focused on PC gaming on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is betting big on a world’s worth of children’s stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WypbZ2HwPJBsvw6RjDK0sl_cfhs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897452/RD_NETFLIX_LH_V009__0_00_07_21_20181127_5885_fizs41.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrIJ0B"&gt;Streaming’s reigning king announced one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686472/netflix-rumor-roald-dahl-willy-wonka-bfg-matilda"&gt;biggest title acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; to date this week with its purchase of the rights to Roald Dahl’s catalog of work. The deal, following regulatory approval, will give Netflix access to a universe of beloved children’s stories to mine and position the company to better compete with kid-friendly competitors like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbBr7z"&gt;The acquisition of the trove of intellectual property follows a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflixs-roald-dahl-deal-could-create-tv-universe-1164419/"&gt;previous partnership&lt;/a&gt; between Netflix and the Roald Dahl Story Company announced in 2018 to adapt some of the late author’s iconic titles. With access to the full library of Dahl stories — which include children’s classics like &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;James and the Giant Peach&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The BFG&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Matilda&lt;/em&gt;, among others — Netflix has the opportunity to build an entire world from the catalog, boosting its originals draw and keeping kids and parents hooked on its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbUpeY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix has previously said it plans to invest in its children’s content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tPOQFz"&gt;The deal is arguably one of the most significant acquisitions Netflix has made in its programming in recent memory, and it speaks to the importance of kids’ content for the service’s continued growth. The company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963816/spongebob-squarepants-spinoff-netflix-nickelodeon-deal-disney-streaming"&gt;huge deal with Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt; for original animated films and series in 2019, a year after the original Dahl partnership was announced, and it recently &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/netflix-orders-3-seasons-cocomelon-lane-animated-preschool-series-specials-little-baby-bum-1234791577/"&gt;ordered three seasons&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;Cocomelon&lt;/em&gt; spinoff, after initially bringing the YouTube-hit kids’ series to its service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJonPn"&gt;Netflix has also pointed toward &lt;em&gt;The Willoughbys&lt;/em&gt;, a 2020 animated comedy the service said reached nearly 38 million households in its first four weeks, as “an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster our offering for kids and families.” With Dahl’s library, Netflix may very well be making its biggest bet yet in furthering that goal. (Netflix didn’t specify how much it paid for the catalog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MixeQu"&gt;Netflix is competing in a space that’s becoming more crowded by the day. Its obvious primary competitor for children’s streaming, Disney Plus, zoomed past the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;100 million subscriptions mark&lt;/a&gt; by first quarter of 2021. Meanwhile, HBO Max (which has the DC catalog under its umbrella, among other properties) and Apple TV Plus (which has &lt;em&gt;Peanuts &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;-adjacent properties) have also focused their sights on children’s programming. That’s to say nothing of the series and films for kids available as free-to-stream titles on other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jigJU7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix will develop “a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tho4Fa"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-acquires-iconic-roald-dahl-story-company"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about this week’s acquisition, Netflix said its existing partnership with the Dahl organization “opened our eyes to a much more ambitious venture — the creation of a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre, consumer products and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koNnRj"&gt;The “more” in Netflix’s statement certainly speaks to the company’s indication that it’s interested in continuing to build out franchises and fan communities, most recently with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;big bet on gaming&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other streamers that have primarily focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;acquiring legacy studios&lt;/a&gt; for mountains of money as a means of swooping up valuable IP, Netflix has been far more conservative about its investments — underscoring how valuable Netflix sees the Dahl IP as being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXRJUT"&gt;“The industry has consolidated materially over the years […] and we don’t believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if at all,” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt; mere months ago in July. “While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as ‘must-have’ and we haven’t yet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wH6DjU"&gt;There’s no doubt that Netflix cut a very sizable check for Dahl’s books, with which Netflix may even be able to expand beyond children’s stories if reimagined for older audiences. But even as Netflix sidesteps the studio bidding wars, it’s proven that it is willing to pay handsomely when the opportunity — in this case, a world’s worth of children’s stories — is right.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get Teams to go away in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8zrWa_4Rk-wfa6ZoAqmwtxDErDs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897347/Screenshot__24___1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PFOKGy"&gt;When you first install Windows 11, you will probably see a new icon on your Taskbar — or, at least, it will be new if you haven’t been using Microsoft’s Teams collaboration app lately. If you float your cursor across the icon, which looks like a camera inside of a cartoon speech balloon, it will say “Chat.” Click on it, and you’ll be invited to “Meet and chat with friends and family” using Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkmMhu"&gt;If you’re already using Teams, or you’re okay with switching to it, you’re fine. After that, when you click on the Chat icon, you’ll be able to chat with friends, family, and colleagues using a pop-up box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKcSXr"&gt;So what if you’re not interested in using Microsoft Teams? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TrUE8"&gt;There are several things you can do if you find the push to Teams irritating. You can stop Teams from automatically loading every time you start your machine. You can remove the Chat icon from the Taskbar. And, if you really want to go the whole hog, you can uninstall it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSYVJm"&gt;Let’s take these one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PAnQuc"&gt;Stop Teams from loading on startup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nDkYiP"&gt;It’s really simple to simply stop Teams — or any other app that you don’t need — from loading when your machine starts up. This not only gets your machine to start up faster, but it reserves your PC’s memory for the stuff you really want to use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MekomO"&gt;Open the Settings app. There are several methods: you can click on your Start icon and select Settings from the pinned menu; or right-click the Start icon and select Settings; or type “Windows + i” on the keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kpfnai"&gt;Select Apps &amp;gt; Startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S4UVmn"&gt;Scroll down to “Microsoft Teams” and toggle it off. (The app may say “Microsoft Teams (Preview)” instead.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle Teams off so it won’t automatically startup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RH3j-EbviIzGtl72Wq2XT6tjFOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869711/Screenshot__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle Teams off so it won’t automatically start up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mSTui7"&gt;By the way, as long as you’re in the Startup menu, take a look at some of the other apps that automatically start up with your computer; there may be some others that you want to disable (for example, what if you don’t necessarily want to run OneDrive?). Go ahead and do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3Uhoae"&gt;Remove Teams from your Taskbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RGDwU8"&gt;Even if you stop Teams from loading, you’re still going to have the Teams Chat icon sitting in your Taskbar. If you have no intention of using it and want to save your Taskbar for other apps, it’s simple to remove it, though it’s not quite the same process as most of the other apps that are pinned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PKmNER"&gt;Right-click on the Taskbar and then click on “Taskbar settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iC0XXm"&gt;Under Taskbar items, toggle off “Chat”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can easily remove Teams from your Taskbar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwq3u7dDr_PQjY3W-Q972mCkq-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869747/Screenshot__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can easily remove Teams from your Taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MrIYPf"&gt;Uninstall Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc2hLQ"&gt;If you really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don’t want Teams around, you can uninstall it. There are actually two ways of doing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zXzbWs"&gt;Using the Start menu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CJhYht"&gt;Click on the Start menu icon in the Taskbar and then on the “All apps” button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UWwFPk"&gt;Scroll down to the Microsoft Teams app or type “Teams” in the search box. (The app may say “Microsoft Teams (Preview)” instead.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKsbwW"&gt;Right-click on the app and choose “Uninstall.” You’ll be told that the app will be uninstalled, so click “Uninstall” again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can uninstall apps directly from your Start menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQgivh68XgsicUO2_k3NEjcNprc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869964/Screenshot__33_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can uninstall apps directly from your Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mrIoL8"&gt;Using Settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="U2LUQV"&gt;Open the Settings app (see above for various ways to do this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="30PRwf"&gt;Select Apps from the left-hand menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4pTGrb"&gt;Select “Apps &amp;amp; Features”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="axtip9"&gt;Find the Microsoft Teams app, either by scrolling down or typing “Teams” into the search box. (It may say “Microsoft Teams (Preview).”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zijtlL"&gt;Click on the three dots to the right of the app’s name and select “Uninstall.” You’ll be told that the app will be uninstalled, so click “Uninstall” again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also uninstall apps by going to Setup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9fwUzigWIenkUuQ2By7F810lP-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869990/Screenshot__4_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also uninstall apps by going to Setup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ziH428"&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai and Motional expand their footprint in Las Vegas ahead of robotaxi launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Jzhcym36Ms2H6ZRGMBLfM7xK8g=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897340/04._Priority_image.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wlVs2b"&gt;Motional, the autonomous vehicle company that is a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, is growing its presence in Las Vegas as it gears up to launch a commercial robotaxi service in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0v75i"&gt;The company is tripling the size of its closed-course testing facility, doubling its operations center, and hiring over 100 new employees. The larger testing facility will allow for “four times” the volume of testing, including new “high-stress situations,” such as high speeds, complex urban maneuvers, different lighting conditions, and light to heavy rain — all of which have been known to flummox autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w6Ps7u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The vehicle that will be put through this new, rigorous battery of tests will be the Hyundai Ioniq 5&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6l5zu"&gt;The vehicle that will be put through this new, rigorous battery of tests will be the Hyundai Ioniq 5, which Motional has said will be the primary vehicle for its robotaxi fleet. The company recently unveiled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648789/motional-hyundai-ioniq5-robotaxi-lyft-photos"&gt;first images of the Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt; with rooftop lidar sensors and other equipment that will allow it to operate autonomously. The company will also increase the size of its test fleet as it expands its testing capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQpWun"&gt;All of this is to prepare Motional’s AV software for the launch of a commercial robotaxi service in 2023. The service, which is likely to kick off in Las Vegas, will be available on Lyft’s ride-hailing app, after that company sold off its own AV technology development program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;to Toyota for $550 million last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnSMyi"&gt;Motional as a joint venture was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-autonomous-aptiv/hyundai-motor-group-aptiv-to-set-up-4-billion-self-driving-car-venture-idUSKBN1W80WP"&gt;first announced in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when Hyundai said it would spend $1.6 billion on developing a commercial business around autonomous vehicles. Aptiv, a technology company formerly known as Delphi, owns 50 percent of the venture. The company currently has facilities in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Seoul and has also tested its vehicles in Boston and Pittsburgh. In addition to Las Vegas, Motional is also testing its vehicles in Santa Monica, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDMqaU"&gt;Motional’s engineers were responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637822/self-driving-taxi-first-public-trial-singapore-nutonomy"&gt;the world’s first robotaxi pilot in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the first cross-country &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/driverless-car-road-trip-san-francisco-new-york-city/568939/"&gt;New York to San Francisco autonomous trip&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last several years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Aptiv’s — and now Motional’s — fleet of safety driver-monitored autonomous taxis in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; (in partnership with Lyft) have completed “over 100,000 trips.” Earlier this year, the company began testing vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291682/motional-fully-driverless-autonomous-cars-las-vegas"&gt;without a human monitor behind the steering wheel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japanese Breakfast on composing Sable’s sprawling ambient soundtrack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2021 Railbird Festival" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwQz82CqdJuqiSh37QxpUidzbLI=/12x0:6048x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897128/1336993783.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rsiKB3"&gt;This week marks the release of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, a beautiful indie title that looks like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; mixed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17462494/sable-xbox-preview-moebius-zelda-e3-2018"&gt;a comic from Jean “Moebius” Giraud&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not just the game’s art that’s striking, though; the whole experience is accompanied by an excellent original soundtrack composed by Michelle Zauner, the frontwoman for the indie rock band Japanese Breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKncCK"&gt;Ahead of &lt;em&gt;Sable’s&lt;/em&gt; launch on Thursday and the release of the official soundtrack on Friday, I got the opportunity to talk to Zauner about composing the music for the game. It has a completely different sound than what you might be used to from her other work, so I wanted to know what it was like to make the music and where she got her inspiration. There was a lot to talk about, including glow worms, pop music, a humongous Spotify playlist, and the &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I09MOI"&gt;Read on for the full conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWbLtd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: How did you get involved with the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDAhjX"&gt;Michelle Zauner: I believe in 2017, Daniel Fineberg, one of the developers, reached out to me on Twitter in a DM. I had just released my second album, “Soft Sounds From Another Planet,” and to help promote it, me and this woman named Elaine Fath worked on developing a mini-RPG game called &lt;a href="http://japanesebreakfast.rocks/BreakQuest/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Japanese BreakQuest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that had mini versions of all of the songs from the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg4qzu"&gt;Daniel and Greg [Kythreotis], the developers of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, really wanted to work with a composer that was outside of the gaming world and could offer a kind of something new to the world that they were building. I think Daniel was a fan of Japanese Breakfast, and, seeing that I was interested in games and enjoyed them, thought that I would be a good fit. I had only seen the GIFs of the art at that time because that was all that was really there. And I loved it and just knew I wanted to be involved right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx7YRN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the process of actually working on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? I’m curious about how you collaborated with the developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzu4EL"&gt;I don’t know if it’s normal or not, but I think that I was brought in very early. I was just so excited to be a part of it. I had just finished my second album and I was on the hunt for new projects, and so I started working on music really early on before I had even seen much of the game. At the time, there was just a large Word doc of what they were trying for and what the different biomes were going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWWt7r"&gt;On tour, I was writing a lot with plugins on the computer, [thinking about] what, like, a glow worm cave would look like, based on a description. And then, in 2019, more of the game and more of the narrative started coming together. I would see sort of videos of the different areas and realize whether or not the music that I had composed earlier fit better in different sections, and so I just continued to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IPZgT3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In 2020, I would say I spent a majority of my lockdown playing the updated builds of the game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xykhWF"&gt;In 2020, I would say I spent a majority of my lockdown playing the updated builds of the game. That’s when the real concentrated work started happening; playing the updated builds every week and finding where we could put music in ways that can uplift certain sections, where to place the songs, and how to integrate the music with the sound designer, Martin Wallace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kczD8h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the developers change anything based on the music you created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WdNBR"&gt;Yeah, I do think so. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej5-CHAGr34"&gt;“Glider”&lt;/a&gt; pretty early on in the process before the narrative was really shored up. I had maybe 10 key words of what I knew [the developers] were going for that I was working off of to incorporate lyrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIeRMo"&gt;We all knew really early on that we were going to have a major moment in the game where you leave the main area and there’s this theme that plays. When you leave your village, [the developers] were inspired by the&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUXGW6sWYDY"&gt; Jose Gonzalez composition in &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; there being this long moment where you get a song that has vocals in it that paints the mood and the feeling of what it’s like to leave your hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sy01e6"&gt;I knew that that was going to be a big moment, and I wanted to tackle that problem pretty early. I think some of the lyrical content and some of the structure of that song helped inform some of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVL3rS"&gt;I also wrote the end theme before there was a cutscene at the end, and they were able to cut and edit to that. And I think that as they were coloring certain worlds, they were able to listen to music I had pitched and hopefully be inspired by that in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kB8rHr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZ_wSTQtVoU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="auCLi7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was composing for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; different than for Japanese Breakfast or writing your own music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ucAR0"&gt;Super different in two major ways. One is that Japanese Breakfast essentially is like a pop project. There’s a real structure in pop music with repeating choruses, and you’re constantly trying to create an earworm and get a hook out as quickly as possible. Whereas in these ambient instrumental pieces [in &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;] in which you’re traversing an open world, you really need them to not become grating. The sprawling ambient loops are a very new type of writing that I had to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxEkOU"&gt;Lyrically, [&lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;] was very different. So much of my work in Japanese Breakfast is very personal and rooted in specific details of my life, while &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; has nothing to do with me. I had to write lyrics that were very broad and universal and touch on what it’s like to come of age or be uncertain about your future. It was really fun to learn that I don’t have to excavate my own personal trauma in order to write compelling music; I can write these themes that can apply to anyone and they can be moving in a unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqxWJK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’ll take any of what you learned working on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to your next album?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQgiok"&gt;Yeah, absolutely. I think that “Better the Mask” [which you can hear part of&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fojy_YRseGk"&gt; in this trailer&lt;/a&gt;] may be the best song I’ve ever written. I’m most proud of my work on that song. I’ve become a lot more competent at arranging strings and piano for the first time. I’ve grown so much as a producer on this project, as the sole producer on the project, and I definitely will apply a lot of those lessons for Japanese Breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0AMtK8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fojy_YRseGk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9lmj2V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I saw you had an amazing Spotify playlist with like 150 songs of inspiration [note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3IfOa8ezSw5loNhhYlrw0c?si=mYUCqYptTuWdNOeP3Oltsw&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it actually has 173 songs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;]. How did that come together and how did you use it while you were writing things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sRZt7"&gt;I was pretty new to ambient music and I really fell in love with it over the course of working on this project. I started collecting a Spotify playlist to make sure that Greg and Daniel and Martin and I were in conversation of what the vibe was going to be like and that nothing was off-putting to them and because I ultimately felt like I was contributing to their world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzCCY4"&gt;I haven’t been the creative director on the project. I’m just a contributor. I think that [the playlist] was a really wonderful way to share my inspiration and talk to Greg and Daniel about what kind of music they were inspired by and thought of when creating these different spaces. [The playlist] was a really fun thing to toss back and forth and use as a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCH6wX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What games were you inspired by, if any?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NShg7e"&gt;The first video game I played as a kid that made me realize that video games were a real art form was this game called &lt;em&gt;Secret of Mana&lt;/em&gt; for SNES. It’s an RPG game that I played with my father. I love the soundtrack to that game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAlF0W"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack was a really important one. I really love the &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack, and particularly the variations of themes they have for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDqt9Z7K1Lo"&gt;another world&lt;/a&gt;. I thought about those a lot when working on the day and nighttime variations for the different biomes [in &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;]. And I like all of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games, which have such incredible soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ERUQm"&gt;I know that Greg referenced &lt;em&gt;Majora’s Mask&lt;/em&gt; a lot because there’s this haunting, strange quality that Koji Kondo has that we wanted to bring out for the Mask Caster or certain areas of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQtwc0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’d work on any more games in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eeHgp"&gt;I hope that this is a good resume addition to showcase my breadth as a composer. Hopefully another really mesmerizing project like this will enter my life someday in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8dXqQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of project would be most interesting to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTIVxk"&gt;I don’t know. &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; was such a perfect project for me to be a part of. It was a real joy and honor to get to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lINZb7"&gt;It would be fun to work on some kind of platformer that was less ambient and more obnoxious with an in-your-face kind of theme. If I could do more songs like the “Chum Lair” song on the soundtrack, I think that would be a fun new area to flex for me. And it’s very different from &lt;em&gt;Sable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="27m3HK"&gt;The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613"&gt;has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to fit a common USB-C charging port on their devices. The proposal is likely to have the biggest impact on Apple, which continues to use its proprietary Lightning connector rather than the USB-C connector adopted by most of its competitors. The rules are intended to cut down on electronic waste by allowing people to re-use existing chargers and cables when they buy new electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KcrXf"&gt;In addition to phones, the rules will apply to other devices like tablets, headphones, portable speakers, videogame consoles, and cameras. Manufacturers will also be forced to make their fast-charging standards interoperable, and to provide information to customers about what charging standards their device supports. Under the proposal, customers will be able to buy new devices without an included charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVElTN"&gt;The proposals only cover devices using wired, not wireless, chargers, EU commissioner Thierry Breton said in a press conference, adding that “there is plenty of room for innovation on wireless.” A spokesperson for the Commission subsequently confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a USB-C port is only mandatory for devices that charge using a cable. But, if a device charges exclusively via wireless, like Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;rumored portless iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, there’d be no requirement for a USB-C charging port. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0OZTOD"&gt;To become law, the revised Radio Equipment Directive proposal will need to pass a vote in the European Parliament. If adopted, manufacturers will eventually have 24 months to comply with the new rules. The parliament has already &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200128IPR71205/parliament-wants-binding-rules-on-common-chargers-to-be-tabled-by-summer"&gt;voted in favor&lt;/a&gt; of new rules on a common charger in early 2020, indicating that today’s proposal should have broad support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8R3VV5"&gt;“Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that,” said commissioner Thierry Breton. “With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKOT4v"&gt;“European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger,” European Commission executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GAh1Qy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Are your chargers piling up in a drawer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We propose a common charger for mobile phones and other similar electronic devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A single charger will be more convenient for people and will reduce electronic waste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/hkspfjwlhu"&gt;https://t.co/hkspfjwlhu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalEU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DigitalEU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZhWZ8xSGKH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZhWZ8xSGKH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— European Commission    (@EU_Commission) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1440996773653323782?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vHUX30"&gt;Today’s proposal is focused on the charging port on the device end, but the Commission says it eventually hopes to ensure “full interoperability” on both ends of the cable. The power supply end will be addressed in a review to be launched later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5EQLC"&gt;The proposals follow a vote in the European Parliament &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200128IPR71205/parliament-wants-binding-rules-on-common-chargers-to-be-tabled-by-summer"&gt;in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; when lawmakers voted for new rules on common chargers. As of 2016, the amount of electronic waste produced across the bloc amounted to around 12.3 million metric tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snb9BS"&gt;The biggest impact of the new rules is likely to be felt by Apple, which continues to ship phones with a Lightning connector as opposed to the increasingly universal USB-C port. As of 2018, around 29 percent of phone chargers sold in the EU used USB-C, 21 percent used Lightning, and around half used the older Micro USB standard, according to an &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-propose-legislation-common-mobile-161928494.html"&gt;EU assessment reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These proportions are likely to have shifted considerably as USB-C has replaced Micro USB across all but the least expensive Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrEim9"&gt;Efforts to get smartphone manufacturers to use the same charging standard in the EU date back to at least 2009, when Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Nokia &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-09-european-unions-one-charger-for-all-starts-sampling.html"&gt;signed a voluntary agreement&lt;/a&gt; to use a common standard. In the following years, the industry gradually adopted Micro USB and, more recently, USB-C as a common charging port. However, despite reducing the amount of charging standards from over 30 down to just three (Micro USB, USB-C, and Lightning), regulators have said this voluntary approach has fallen short of its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNtfm8"&gt;Apple was a notable outlier in that it never included a Micro USB port on its phones directly. Instead, it offered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/4/2469886/apple-releases-micro-usb-adapter-for-iphone"&gt;Micro USB to 30-pin adapter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyFInq"&gt;Apple said it disagreed with today’s proposals in a statement. “We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,” a spokesperson from the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/eu-plans-one-mobile-charging-port-all-setback-apple-2021-09-23/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;previously objected to the proposals&lt;/a&gt; because it says they risk creating e-waste by forcing people to throw out their existing Lightning accessories if they’re incompatible with the universal standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ6VGs"&gt;Although it’s continued to use Lightning, Apple has made its own efforts to reduce charger e-waste. Last year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;stopped shipping charging bricks or earbuds in the box with new iPhones&lt;/a&gt; and supplied them only with a Lightning to USB-C cable. However, the move was met with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;mixed response&lt;/a&gt;, with some arguing that it helped Apple’s bottom line more than the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNBqMJ"&gt;While European lawmakers focus mainly on wired chargers, wireless charging is becoming increasingly popular across smartphones and has largely converged on a single cross-platform standard: Qi. There have even been rumors that Apple could ship an iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/"&gt;without a Lightning port&lt;/a&gt; and have it rely entirely on wireless charging for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1PTil"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Septeber 23rd, 9:22AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Breton’s comments about wireless chargers from Q&amp;amp;A, and confirmation that a completely wireless phone would not need to include USB-C. Also added comment from Apple. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why these Facebook research scandals are different</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How the company found itself in its biggest crisis since Cambridge Analytica&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Fs70Fs"&gt;A week ago, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; began to publish a series of stories about Facebook based on the internal findings of the company’s researchers. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;The Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;, as they are known, lay out a dizzying number of problems unfolding on the world’s biggest social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQW7MZ"&gt;The stories detail &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=article_inline"&gt;an opaque, separate system of government for elite users&lt;/a&gt; known as XCheck; provide evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;Instagram can be harmful to a significant percentage of teenage girls&lt;/a&gt;; and reveal that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline"&gt;entire political parties have changed their policies&lt;/a&gt; in response to changes in the News Feed algorithm. The stories also &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953?mod=article_inline"&gt;uncovered massive inequality in how Facebook moderates content in foreign countries&lt;/a&gt; compared to the investment it has made in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjm37o"&gt;The stories have galvanized public attention, and members of Congress &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-seek-answers-from-facebook-after-wsj-report-on-instagrams-impact-on-young-users-11631664695"&gt;have announced a probe&lt;/a&gt;. And scrutiny is growing as reporters at other outlets contribute material of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxFRsK"&gt;For instance: &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; found that despite Facebook’s significant investment in security, by October 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/"&gt;Eastern European troll farms reached 140 million people a month with propaganda&lt;/a&gt; — and 75 percent of those users saw it not because they followed a page but because Facebook’s recommendation engine served it to them. &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; investigated Facebook Marketplace and &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-grew-marketplace-to-1-billion-users-now-scammers-are-using-it-to-target-people-around-the-world"&gt;found thousands of fake accounts participating in a wide variety of scams&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; revealed that Facebook has sought to improve its reputation in part &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-project-amplify.html"&gt;by pumping pro-Facebook stories into the News Feed&lt;/a&gt;, an effort known as “Project Amplify.” (To date this has only been tested in three cities, and it’s not clear whether it will continue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ienlG6"&gt;Most Facebook scandals come and go. But this one feels different than Facebook scandals of the past, because it has been led by Facebook’s own workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="colYiv"&gt;
&lt;p id="CuX98e"&gt;The last time Facebook found itself under this much public scrutiny was 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;when the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal&lt;/a&gt; rocked the company. It was a strange scandal for many reasons, not least of which was the fact that most of its details had been reported years previously. What turned it into an international story was the idea that political operatives had sought to use Facebook’s vast trove of demographic data in an effort to manipulate Americans into voting for Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wwcrky"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook ads get people to buy — but not change their politics?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOP7aJ"&gt;Today nearly everyone agrees that what Cambridge Analytica called “&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/3/23/17152564/cambridge-analytica-psychographic-microtargeting-what"&gt;psychographic targeting&lt;/a&gt;” was overblown marketing spin. But the idea that Facebook and other social networks are gradually reshaping whole societies with their data collection, advertising practices, ranking algorithms and engagement metrics has largely stuck. Facebook is an all-time great business because its ads are so effective in getting people to buy things. And yet the company wants us to believe it isn’t similarly effective at getting people to change their politics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcFw0G"&gt;There’s a disconnect there, one that the company has never really resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FaaNw"&gt;Still, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/facebook-says-it-has-spent-13-billion-on-safety-security"&gt;it plowed $13 billion into safety and security&lt;/a&gt;. It hired 40,000 people to police the network. It developed a real aptitude at disrupting networks of fake accounts. It got more comfortable inserting high-quality information into the News Feed, whether about COVID-19 or climate change. When the 2020 US presidential election was over, Facebook was barely a footnote in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdJ2A0"&gt;But basic questions lingered. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; was the network policed, exactly? Are different countries being policed equitably? And what does looking at a personalized feed like that every day to do a person, or to a country and its politics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpNQjX"&gt;As always, there’s a risk of being a technological determinist here: to assume that Facebook’s algorithms are more powerful they are, or operate in a vacuum. Research that I’ve highlighted in this column has shown that often, other forces can be even more powerful — Fox News, for example, can inspire a much greater shift in a person’s politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deJcyq"&gt;For a lot of reasons, we would all stand to benefit if we could better isolate the effect of Facebook — or YouTube, or TikTok, or Twitter — on the larger world. But because they keep their data private, for reasons both good and bad, we spend a lot of time arguing about subjects for which we often have little grounding in empiricism. We talk about what Facebook &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; based on how Facebook makes us &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;. And so Facebook and the world wind up talking past each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1eVYr"&gt;At the same time, and to its credit, Facebook did allocate some resources to investigating some of the questions on our minds. Questions like, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Instagram doing to teenage girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBH3MR"&gt;In doing so, Facebook planted the seeds of the current moment. The most pressing questions in the recent reporting ask the same question Cambridge Analytica did — &lt;em&gt;what is this social network doing to us&lt;/em&gt;? But unlike with that story, this time we have real data to look at — data that Facebook itself produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="m8KHQl"&gt;
&lt;p id="puyqyG"&gt;When I talk to some people at Facebook about some of this, they bristle. They’ll say: reporters have had it out for us forever; the recent stories all bear more than a faint trace of confirmation bias. They’ll say: just because one researcher at the company says something doesn’t mean it’s true. They’ll ask: why isn’t anyone demanding to see internal research from YouTube, or Twitter, or TikTok?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Op46Ax"&gt;Perhaps this explains the company’s generally dismissive response to all this reporting. The emotional, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/"&gt;scattered Nick Clegg blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/its-about-ethics-in-surf-journalism"&gt;CEO joking about it&lt;/a&gt;. The mainstream media — &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_you_go_again"&gt;there they go again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYGAjp"&gt;To me, though, the past week has felt like a turning point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlGQBW"&gt;By now, the majority of Facebook researchers to ever speak out about the company in public have taken the opportunity to say that their research was largely stymied or ignored by their superiors. And what we have read of their research suggests that the company has often acted irresponsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xFccgO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The past week has felt like a turning point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sTcUqA"&gt;Sometimes this is unintentional — Facebook appears to have been genuinely surprised by the finding that Instagram appears to be responsible for the rise in anxiety and depression for teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjQ70M"&gt;Other times, the company acted irresponsibly with full knowledge of what it was doing, as when it allocated massively more resources for removing misleading content in the United States than it does in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6WViK"&gt;And even in the United States, it arguably under-invested in safety and security: as Samidh Chakrabarti, who ran Facebook’s civic integrity team until this year, put it: the company’s much-ballyhooed $13 billion investment &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samidh/status/1440486111726366738?s=20"&gt;represents about four percent of revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MamLeF"&gt;Despite all this, of course, Facebook is thriving. Daily users are up &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/facebook-reports-second-quarter-2021-results/default.aspx"&gt;seven percent year over year&lt;/a&gt;. Profits are up. The post-pandemic ad business is booming so hard that even digital ad also-rans like Pinterest and Twitter are having a banner year. And Facebook’s hardware business is quietly turning into a success, potentially paving a road from here &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;all the way to the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwCqCt"&gt;But still that question nags: &lt;em&gt;what is this social network doing to us?&lt;/em&gt; It now seems apparent that no one at the company, or in the world at large, has really gotten their arms around it. And so the company’s reputation is once again in free fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVIPTM"&gt;One natural reaction to this state of affairs, if you were running the company, would be to do &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; research: no more negative studies, no more negative headlines! What’s Congress going to do, hold a hearing? Who cares. Pass a law? Not this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvpjqv"&gt;When Facebook moved this week &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/09/21/facebook-rolls-out-news-feed-change-that-blocks-watchdogs-from-gathering-data"&gt;to make it harder for people to volunteer their own News Feed data to an external research program&lt;/a&gt;, it signaled that this is the way it is heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zrEOE2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What if Facebook invested in more and more open research, not less?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9x6QbE"&gt;But what if it did the reverse? What if it invested dramatically more in research, and publicly pressured its peers to join it? What if Facebook routinely published its findings and allowed its data to be audited? What if the company made it dramatically easier for qualified researchers to study the platform independently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuKiNZ"&gt;This would be unprecedented in the history of American business, but Facebook is an unprecedented thing in the world. The company can’t rebuild trust with the larger world through blog posts and tweet storms. But it could start by helping us understand its effects on human behavior, politics, and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx13Ph"&gt;That doesn’t seem to be the way things are going, though. Instead, the company is doing different kinds of research — research like “what happens if we show people good news about Facebook?” I’m told one story that appeared in the recent test informed users of an incident in which the social network helped a woman find her lost horse. Maybe &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; will move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqIakm"&gt;But I shouldn’t joke. There’s a real idea embedded in that test, which is that over time you can reshape perception by the narratives you promote. That what appears in the News Feed may be able to shift public opinion over time, to the opinion of whoever is running the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsCVIg"&gt;It is this suspicion that the News Feed can drive such changes that has driven so much of the company’s own research, and fears about the company’s influence, even as that possibility has been relentlessly downplayed by Facebook’s PR machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQeWok"&gt;But now the company has decided to see for itself. To the public, it will promise it can’t possibly be as powerful as its apostate researchers say it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpFkJe"&gt;And then, with Project Amplify, Facebook will attempt to see if they might actually be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gwmrGP"&gt;
&lt;p id="NF4ttn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WSds8g"&gt;The way that Facebook controls its News Feed is often controversial and largely opaque to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4Oobk"&gt;Now the social network is attempting to shine more light on the content it surpresses but doesn't remove entirely. On Thursday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-ranking/types-of-content-we-demote/"&gt;published its “Content Distribution Guidelines”&lt;/a&gt; detailing the roughly three-dozen types of posts it demotes for various reasons in the News Feed, like clickbait and posts by repeat policy offenders. That process, which relies heavily on machine learning technology to automatically detect problematic content, effectively throttles the reach of offending posts and comments without the author knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ88wb"&gt;There’s still plenty that the guidelines, which Facebook has mostly confirmed in various reports over the years but is just now publishing for the first time in one place, don’t say. They don’t detail exactly how a demotion works and exactly how much it reduces a piece of content’s reach. Or how severely a certain kind of post, like a link to spam, is throttled in the News Feed relative to a post about health misinformation, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9iPsO3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to give a clearer sense of what we think is problematic but not worth removing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pYOwF"&gt;“We want to give a clearer sense of what we think is problematic but not worth removing,” Jason Hirsch, Facebook’s head of integrity policy, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He said the company hopes to add more information to the guidelines over time, including how demotions throttle specific kinds of content relative to others. But he said Facebook likely won’t stack rank the severity of demotions “for adversarial reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkWPoW"&gt;Detailing the guidelines now could help Facebook avoid controversy the next time it throttles a high-profile post from going viral, like when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515972/facebook-new-york-post-hunter-biden-story-fact-checking-reduced-distribution-election-misinformation"&gt;it suppressed a story by &lt;em&gt;The New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about U.S. President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. The guidelines spell out that Facebook’s policy is to suppress stories that have been disputed by users as inaccurate — as was the case with &lt;em&gt;The Post’s &lt;/em&gt;dubious reporting — until a review is completed by its network of third-party fact-checkers. That policy was made known widely only a year ago after critics accused the company of political bias for censoring &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ney23b"&gt;According to the distribution guidelines, other types of content Facebook demotes include links to spam sites, “low quality” comments that are either very lengthy with copied text or contain no words at all, posts in groups from accounts that share at a “very high frequency,” and news articles without a clear byline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPkt4d"&gt;Releasing these guidelines is part of a bigger effort to disclose more about how the News Feed works to the public, according to Hirsch. Media outlets and politicians are increasingly examining &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook’s negative effects on the world&lt;/a&gt;, and lawmakers in the US and elsewhere are looking to regulate how social media companies police their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45vRan"&gt;Facebook recently put out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"&gt;its first quarterly report&lt;/a&gt; on the most-viewed content in the News Feed after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"&gt;journalists used its public-facing analysts tool&lt;/a&gt;, CrowdTangle, to show that right-leaning personalities are often the most engaged with on its service. He said that, while building the most-viewed data into a self-service, real-time tool like CrowdTangle would be a “huge investment of time and resources,” the company wasn’t opposed to doing it eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes ‘was in charge’ of Theranos, says Gen. Mattis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5DApprMoH8E6Twb35v-ib_zw7kI=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69896318/1235434673.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;She pricked his finger, and he fell under her spell&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rGKES5"&gt;Theranos’s board member James &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-apr-16-fg-general16-story.html"&gt;“Mad Dog”&lt;/a&gt; Mattis, a four-star general and the former secretary of defense, served among the company’s impeccably credentialed supporters —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but testifying in Elizabeth Holmes’s trial on Wednesday, he resembled nothing so much as a nattily-dressed grandfather. At one point, he seemed befuddled when the defense asked him if he remembered discussion of high-throughput devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N87O2Z"&gt;When Mattis first met Theranos’ Holmes in 2011, he told the court, she pricked his finger to give him an idea of the blood draw process. And like a damsel in a fairy tale, he fell under her spell. At the trial of the US v Elizabeth Holmes, he said he was “taken” with the Theranos device. Now “young Elizabeth,” as Mattis addressed her in an email, faces 10 counts of wire fraud and two of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uODeuE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was a strong believer in getting this in theater so it could stand and deliver.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9j2dyy"&gt;Mattis’ testimony on Wednesday was the most damning of the trial so far. He portrayed Holmes as firmly in control of Theranos, even telling board members what to discuss with the press. He also seems to have been misled about the capabilities of the Theranos analyzer, called Edison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvfg56"&gt;“I’m trying to find a way to employ your device on a swift ‘pilot project’ or ‘proof of principle to expedite its entry to our forces,” Mattis wrote Holmes in October 2011, when he was the commander of US Central Command. In today’s testimony, he said he had wanted to see a side-by-side comparison with existing blood testing technology. That never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAoWkV"&gt;The small size of the analyzer was particularly appealing to him, he testified. Sick bays on ships have limited room, remote locations make it hard to set up labs, and the idea of being able to quickly and accurately run tests to triage wounded soldiers was particularly appealing. “I was a strong believer in getting this in theater so it could stand and deliver,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEoP9v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was pretty breathtaking what she was doing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEexqV"&gt;Mattis also described Holmes as “sharp, articulate, committed” and said she was “aggressive” about trying to work with the Department of Defense. At the time, she didn’t say that Theranos didn’t have the resources to do this, nor did she mention the commercial launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMLcU8"&gt;To Mattis’ knowledge, the Theranos analyzer was never deployed in clandestine operations, on military helicopters, or anywhere else in the military. This is a particular problem for Holmes’ defense, as she told investors Theranos devices were being deployed in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxn74Y"&gt;After retiring from the military, Mattis visited the Theranos headquarters in late 2013. There he saw the Theranos analyzer — and didn’t see the commercially-available equipment that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;Erika Cheung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Surekha Gangakhedkar&lt;/a&gt; testified Theranos was using for most of its tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csSm7E"&gt;Holmes invited him to join the Theranos board to help her build a good corporate culture — his management experience would be helpful, she told him. “It was pretty breathtaking what she was doing,” he said. As a board member, Holmes was not just his primary source of information on Theranos’ tech, she was his sole source of information, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="8cM68a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Ms. Holmes was in charge.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj0Jlc"&gt;Mattis invested $85,000 into Theranos when he joined the board, a significant amount for “someone who has been in government for 40 years,” he said, smiling slightly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSdGND"&gt;At board meetings, Holmes was the primary presenter. Her co-defendant, Sunny Balwani, who is being tried separately, sometimes gave financial forecasts, but “Ms. Holmes was in charge,” Mattis said. There were board meetings where Balwani wasn’t even present, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6o9uT"&gt;This testimony is, naturally, a problem for the defense, which has been trying to shift blame onto Balwani, among others. But it’s consistent with media profiles of Holmes in that period, which presented her as being in complete control of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC4iUl"&gt;Holmes’ media coverage was introduced directly today. First up was a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;that claimed the Theranos devices were “faster, cheaper and more accurate than the conventional methods and require only microscopic blood volumes, not vial after vial of the stuff.” That was consistent with Mattis’ understanding of the technology at the time, he said. The article was also featured in a board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFEcZG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Duty of loyalty”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BS4JpZ"&gt;It wasn’t until later that Mattis learned only a few tests were actually run on the Theranos machine. If he’d known that third party devices were being used for most tests, that “would have tempered my enthusiasm significantly,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tYtuG"&gt;Mattis also spoke to Roger Parloff for &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;his &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; — and before doing so, he asked Holmes for guidance about what to say. Parloff’s article claimed that Theranos “does not buy any analyzers from third parties,” which was not true. But the claim was consistent with what Mattis understood at the time, he told the court. He also received directions about a &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; article: he was not to discuss how the tech worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn1paP"&gt;Later, a Theranos lawyer emailed Mattis to tell him not to talk to John Carreyrou, who was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;reporting his blockbuster story about Theranos&lt;/a&gt;; in the email, Carreyrou’s forthcoming story was described as defaming the company and exposing trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ly89LU"&gt;After the story came out, the board of directors was rebranded as the board of counselors. A slide from that meeting was shown to jurors — and the only part of it that wasn’t redacted were the words “duty of loyalty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc6ktL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I thought all along that we were doing it on Theranos’ gear.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJY6ML"&gt;That didn’t stop another board member, Richard Kovacevich, former head of Wells Fargo, from emailing Holmes and the rest of the board with questions. “So when blood is withdrawn in venous tubes, do I understand correctly that the tests are done on lab-like equipment and not Edison and those are sent to CLIA for testing while Edison is only being used for the FDA tests?” Kovacevich wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6QZho"&gt;Holmes replied that Theranos was transitioning between regulatory standards, and Mattis said he understood that Carryerou had essentially  “caught [the company] in mid-stride.” Holmes did not tell the board that third-party tests were used because Edison didn’t work for everything. “I thought all along that we were doing it on Theranos’ gear,” he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AdQHE"&gt;But after some “surprises, disappointing surprises,” Mattis said he began to question if Edison actually worked. “There came a time when I didn’t know what to believe about Theranos anymore,” he said. He resigned as a member of the board in late 2016, because he understood he was going to be nominated as the Secretary of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJj5FY"&gt;Damaging as his testimony was, it also seemed that Mattis was easily confused. He wasn’t entirely sure where he’d met Holmes for the first time, though he knew it was before or after a speech in San Francisco. He also didn’t remember he’d bought stock options in the company — though the defense displayed the paperwork showing he did. When asked how much he made a year as a board member, Mattis said $50,000; documents introduced by the defense revealed he’d actually made $150,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3if0l"&gt;But when the defense tried to get him to say that Holmes never told him the tech was ready, Mattis pushed back. Holmes had told him the tech was ready to deploy in the field for a side-by-side comparison with existing blood tests, he insisted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RXh89c"&gt;“I assumed it would be more than a handful of tests,” Mattis said, “or it would be useless to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
