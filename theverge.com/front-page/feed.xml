    <title>Amazon is suing to stop SMS raffle scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R7sHfqJzjTUweDKT2DFlEu5t-fM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272573/ngarun_181114_1777_amazon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oTHjwZ"&gt;Ever get a text message informing you that you’ve won a prize — from Amazon itself? I certainly have, and I’ve even known a person or two who fell for those scams. Now, Amazon is attempting to hunt those scammers down, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006213/en/Amazon-Announces-Lawsuit-to-Combat-Fraudulent-Affiliate-Marketing-Schemes/"&gt;with a new lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; aimed at unmasking 50 unknown defendants in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJFU5W"&gt;Here’s the text message I received the other day from one such scammer:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Whban3GKO4Yt1MxBjNZUNZ2W8Hw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508506/amazon_text_message_scam.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="caQzRT"&gt;And here’s where it took me when I clicked:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8miuX4Qtr8qdj5_mYaeOJ5A2IWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508196/image__7_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jSdvQM"&gt;According to Amazon’s legal complaint, which you can read in full below, the scam uses Amazon’s logos, web design, and meaningless “surveys” to trick people into buying products (ones that aren’t actually from Amazon), seemingly for cheap. The scammers aren’t necessarily the ones selling those products, either — but because they’re acting as referrers, they get a finder’s fee in the form of affiliate marketing commissions. The Better Business Bureau says &lt;a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/23914-bbb-warning-you-won-raffle-from-amazon-watch-out-its-another-scam"&gt;it received 771 reports of scams impersonating Amazon in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, second only to those annoying calls claiming to be the Social Security Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJWZMd"&gt;The tricky part is finding the scammers, because Amazon doesn’t actually know who they are, just which domain names they used to host the scam. But by filing a lawsuit against these 50 John Doe plaintiffs, Amazon may be able to get a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_subpoena"&gt;doe subpoena&lt;/a&gt; to unmask their identities. The company tells us that’s worked in the past; in 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-files-suit-malvertising-campaign-alleging-sophisticated-widespread-scheme-deceive-consumers/"&gt;filed a John Doe lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against a very similar scam and was able to track down at least four defendants. Each case ended with a permanent injunction, according to court records, and Amazon says it’s won at least $1.5 million in settlements so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSARNM"&gt;The lawsuit also gives Amazon time to find them (against the statute of limitations) and puts the scammers on notice, just in case they might like to stop before they get hauled into court. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It seems the patent office wanted number 11 million to be special, not soy</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P3AOXV"&gt;The US Patent Office issued &lt;a href="https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=11,000,000.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/11,000,000&amp;amp;RS=PN/11,000,000"&gt;utility patent number 11 million&lt;/a&gt; today, granting the milestone number to a patent entitled “repositioning wires and methods for repositioning prosthetic heart valve devices within a heart chamber and related systems, devices and methods.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFN7JT"&gt;Even without understanding exactly what that means, it just screams progress, doesn’t it? Prosthetic heart valves? Surgery? This truly is the future that the patent system enables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPzm7U"&gt;There have, however, been accusations that the patent office cherry-picked &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; invention would get the most notable number in years (patent 10 million was awarded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/uspto/status/1392162744942665731?s=20"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;), aiming to give it to something exciting, rather than bland like, say, a soybean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t1OnrL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As a side note, patent numbers are normally assigned in groups by subject matter, but apparently it wasn't exciting enough for Patent No. 11,000,000 to go to a new soybean. &lt;a href="https://t.co/auDOp2MwMd"&gt;https://t.co/auDOp2MwMd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/6b2lQ8Rk41"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6b2lQ8Rk41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Steck (@GazEtc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GazEtc/status/1392228236055224323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EuJNnJ"&gt;Could it really be true? To see if that was the case, I looked at the patents that were granted before and after it, to see if they really were as boring as Twitter alleged. And I found that they absolutely were. The prosthetic heart valve-related patent is, in fact, c-c-c-combo-breaking what would otherwise be a string of six soybean-related patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODQSSK"&gt;That’s not all, though. I looked back at patents 10,999,990 through 10,999,999, and before the soy starts, there’s a string of patents about &lt;a href="https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=10,999,995.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/10,999,995&amp;amp;RS=PN/10,999,995"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=10,999,992.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/10,999,992&amp;amp;RS=PN/10,999,992"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=10,999,991.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/10,999,991&amp;amp;RS=PN/10,999,991"&gt;cucumbers&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, it’s not a lot sexier. Going the other direction, &lt;a href="https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=11,000,005.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/11,000,005&amp;amp;RS=PN/11,000,005"&gt;patent 11,000,005&lt;/a&gt; is for an edible (non-soy) bean called COWBOY, and 11,000,006 is about a tomato variant. Then things just start getting weird, with pet doors and farm equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UycOK9"&gt;Whether the patent office purposefully stole soy’s thunder probably isn’t something we’ll ever know for sure, but to me the evidence is pretty compelling. The Patent Office sure made a big deal about 11 million on Twitter, tweeting about it more than a few times. Surely it must’ve known it wouldn’t have been as exciting if the celebrated patent had been one of six soybeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k2yU5B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USPTO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#USPTO&lt;/a&gt; officially issued U.S. patent number 11 million, a significant milestone in the history of American innovation and ingenuity.  Read more about this important achievement and the invention behind the milestone: &lt;a href="https://t.co/zNOHu0st0J"&gt;https://t.co/zNOHu0st0J&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Patent11Million?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Patent11Million&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uIiRh3Ojhe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uIiRh3Ojhe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— USPTO (@uspto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/uspto/status/1392106025495539715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RWl24m"&gt;I’ll be keeping an eye out for any funny business around patent number 11,111,111 as this is, obviously, a very serious issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie accidentally turns on Destiny 2 crossplay months early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7CCxaH4cAA2HkRgvE85mu2nfuHE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272383/destiny_shadowkeep_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MuWug8"&gt;Some Destiny 2 players have been able to play with people on other platforms after developer Bungie inadvertently switched the feature on. Bungie previously said that crossplay would be coming in fall 2021 for every platform that the game is available on, including PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Google Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzpmHB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Tom Warren spotted that the crossplay feature went live and was able to load up a game with players on both PC and Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DIoUoW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I can confirm Destiny 2 crossplay has been enabled. This is a crucible game between Google Stadia and PC players   &lt;a href="https://t.co/muspTba7Aw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/muspTba7Aw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1392281169832648707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cuMlQ5"&gt;Bungie community manager Cozmo, however, confirmed that crossplay was not supposed to have launched yet. “We are seeing reports that some players are able to get a sneak peek at Crossplay,” he wrote in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cozmo23/status/1392286577187905540"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “This isn’t meant to be live yet and is not representative of the full experience. We will be implementing a fix to remove public access later this week, but in the meantime feel free to partake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxhLJk"&gt;Bungie just today launched &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;’s latest seasonal update, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22430572/destiny-2-season-splicer-patch-notes-update-stasis-transmog-vault-glass"&gt;Season of the Splicer&lt;/a&gt;, which brings the usual array of new content and activities. It’s unfortunate that crossplay appears to have been an unintended inclusion — particularly if you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21252200/google-stadia-cross-play-games-lonely-venue"&gt;Stadia player in need of more people to join your games&lt;/a&gt; — but for now it sounds like you’ll be able to check it out a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC approves $7 billion to get better equipment to remote learners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AEHuIU25wysYQ1Q3pAeaClwC2js=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272197/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emergency Connectivity Fund Program helps schools and libraries outfit students and patrons with remote learning equipment&lt;/em&gt; | Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UOGsUE"&gt;The FCC has &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launch-717-billion-connectivity-fund-program-0"&gt;approved $7.17 billion in funding&lt;/a&gt; to help students, school staff, and library patrons access hotspots and connected devices to use at home. The Emergency Connectivity Fund Program will allow schools and libraries to purchase equipment to be used off-site — and to get reimbursement for equipment already purchased to address remote learning needs during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynGuhS"&gt;The new fund will use processes already in use by the E-Rate program, which currently helps schools and libraries pay for broadband internet. Qualifying schools and libraries will be able to purchase hotspots, routers, tablets, and computers, among other devices necessary for remote learning (though smartphones don’t qualify). Students and patrons can take them home and use them, rather than &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/31/us/taco-bell-california-students-wifi-trnd/index.html"&gt;huddle outside of a Taco Bell&lt;/a&gt; in order to finish their homework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bq0fP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;9 million public school students live in homes lacking both adequate internet access and a suitable device for remote learning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WoLsK9"&gt;This well-known “homework gap” that has seen millions of kids struggle to participate in remote learning is an issue that FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel is keen to address. Since the very beginning of the pandemic, she has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;called on the FCC&lt;/a&gt; to help schools and libraries get hold of equipment sorely needed in many homes across the country — the FCC quotes a study from last spring that found about nine million public school students live in homes lacking both adequate internet access and a suitable device for remote learning. With this new funding and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302807/fcc-internet-subsidies-authorized-low-income-broadband"&gt;Emergency Broadband Benefit Program&lt;/a&gt; already underway, there may be a bit of relief in sight for these households.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple keeps coming back to the gap between ignorance and inconvenience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58SAFjI73j_WHaXt4TY_U6lokRM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272119/vpavic_180607_2652_0053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LSZxry"&gt;Last week, the judge in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple &lt;/em&gt;asked whether Epic really had an antitrust case against Apple, or whether it just wanted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"&gt;help kids make impulse purchases&lt;/a&gt;. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers was talking about the importance of where and how&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;people pay for their apps, and today she continued that line of questioning to the point of suggesting a kind of App Store policy change that Epic never originally put on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwAZu0"&gt;Epic sued Apple for banning &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from iOS over a direct payment system for V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game currency. Epic called that unfair and monopolistic. But Apple argued that it lets developers sell in-app purchases through its Safari browser, even at a discounted price — so there’s no lockout. And while Epic itself has focused on explaining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;why web apps aren’t a good substitute for native ones&lt;/a&gt;, its expert witness David Evans brought up another major issue: anti-steering rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zkfpT"&gt;Anti-steering rules (in this context) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_2093"&gt;refer to rules that ban&lt;/a&gt; developers from pointing users outside of Apple’s ecosystem. iOS developers can’t add links or references telling people to get a better deal on their website, or send emails to accounts created through Apple. Android has these rules too, but it &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/google-announces-crackdown-on-in-app-billing-aimed-at-netflix-and-spotify/"&gt;delayed a serious crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on them until this fall — and since you can install third-party stores and sideload apps on Android, developers in Google’s ecosystem have more options in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AhA7LQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An Epic witness compared app makers to moonlighting Uber drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNqBnD"&gt;Evans, an economist, was originally trying to explain in-app purchases by comparing Apple to a ride-hailing app like Uber, comparing an app developer to a Uber driver who had struck up a good relationship with a customer. The customer wanted to start directly hiring the driver, but the ride-hailing company (representing Apple) demanded that the customer keep paying through its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqngEz"&gt;Judge Rogers didn’t appear convinced. Buying V-Bucks through a browser, she noted, seemed a lot like a passenger directly paying a driver. “There’s nothing about that distribution process that impacted differently given your Uber example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nExCIp"&gt;Evans basically responded that in this analogy, cab drivers can’t even do the equivalent of giving passengers their phone numbers. “Epic is not able to message the iOS app user and tell them ‘You can go to the web and get this more cheaply.’ Or ‘I really encourage you to go to the web and get V-Bucks there,’” Evans objected. The problem, he said, was the combination of requiring Epic to use Apple payment processing, plus a “whole set of barriers” that make it harder to tell users they have an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gml1aD"&gt;These anti-steering provisions have come up in the trial before — yoga app maker Yoga Buddhi complained about them last week. But this time, Rogers offered an obvious followup question. If there was no anti-steering provision, she asked, would Epic still have a problem with Apple’s system? “The customer could choose whether they wanted to stay and make the purchase on the app or do it some other way, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3U1sKW"&gt;Evans admitted that nixing the anti-steering provisions “wouldn’t eliminate the market power that Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it.” He said it would be more helpful for some apps than others — it’s pretty good for subscription-based companies that have a separate website, for instance, and less useful for mobile-only games that rely on a stream of microtransactions. But he acknowledged he hadn’t conducted a specific study of the topic, so he wasn’t sure exactly &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;big the issue would still be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RixG0U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers do get klutzy and disconnected”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rfvFm6"&gt;Later in the day, economist Susan Athey raised a different issue with App Store exclusivity. The App Store lets users sign up for subscriptions, but if they switch to an Android phone, they have to either cancel their subscription or keep managing it through Apple. Athey was using this to explain why a third-party app store would be useful, should Apple ever allow one to exist — if you could access the same purchase from both big phone platforms, the same way you can get your old iOS apps on a new iPhone, switching devices could become much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okte7i"&gt;But Rogers suggested again that if developers could just tell people to sign up through the web, “then there wouldn’t really be the same kind of need for the kind of cross-platform app store that you’re talking about.” After all, services like Netflix already direct people to sign up through their websites — Apple and Google just really don’t like it, and they try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;discourage the practice&lt;/a&gt; without an actual ban. Similar to Evans, Athey conceded that there’d be a “big benefit” in letting app makers “alert people to the most efficient way to pay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVwlre"&gt;Athey argued that “consumers do get klutzy and disconnected and sensitive to delays when trying to complete that type of activity,” and telling people to go use a web browser doesn’t solve that problem. But Rogers could easily decide that inconvenience and enforced ignorance are separate issues, and that only the latter is a serious antitrust concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXDmwY"&gt;Getting rid of anti-steering provisions would be a comparatively small win for Epic, which wants to put full-fledged third-party App Stores on iOS. But it’s a smartphone ecosystem feature that’s often overshadowed by bigger antitrust complaints — and &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; is putting it under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CryptoPunks NFTs sell at Christie’s for $16.9 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The collection features nine portraits, including one alien." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DaxVZ9VubSNQlZm3KU5zEjKQqjY=/34x0:1017x655/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272050/cryptopunks_9_punks_larva_labs_nfts_at_christies_new_rvs_0409.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nine CryptoPunks sold together at Christie’s. | Image: Christie’s / Larva Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRCany"&gt;Another huge NFT sale was made at Christie’s tonight: &lt;a href="https://www.christies.com/lot/lot-larva-labs-est-2005-9-cryptopunks-2-6316969/?from=salesummary&amp;amp;intObjectID=6316969"&gt;a collection of nine CryptoPunks&lt;/a&gt; was purchased for $16.9 million. It’s likely the second-largest NFT purchases ever made, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;behind Beeple’s $69 million sale&lt;/a&gt; in March (though with the notable caveat that this sale included nine separate works).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz4c1J"&gt;CryptoPunks were one of the earliest NFT projects, and they’ve become increasingly valuable as collector’s items. The project, created by Larva Labs in 2017, offered 10,000 small pixel-art portraits of people, zombies, aliens, and apes. Each one was algorithmically generated and features different attributes, like their hairstyle, glasses, or hat. Some traits are rarer than others, and those tend to make for more valuable CryptoPunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nBiUpY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mycFZe"&gt;This sale of nine CryptoPunks comes from Larva Labs itself. The group initially kept 1,000 of the NFTs for themselves and gave away the rest. The bundle of nine includes one CryptoPunk with a particularly rare trait: &lt;em&gt;CryptoPunk 635&lt;/em&gt;, the one with the blue face and sunglasses, is one of just nine “alien” punks in the entire series. Another of the nine sold, &lt;em&gt;CryptoPunk 2&lt;/em&gt;, the one with wild black hair that looks a bit like a heart, has the distinction of being number two out of a 10,000-work series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpIkww"&gt;CryptoPunks have soared in popularity since NFTs started blowing up in February. Two alien punks sold in March for more than $7.5 million each. Another seven have sold for more than $1 million, all just in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdNagM"&gt;This is Christie’s second huge NFT sale. The auction house &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;sold a Beeple NFT for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March, marking a high point for the NFT market. An NFT by Emily Ratajkowski &lt;a href="https://www.christies.com/lot/lot--6317722/"&gt;will go up for auction&lt;/a&gt; at Christie’s later this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The T-Mobile / Sprint merger hasn’t created jobs — it’s ended them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0jsesPQ0YdAAwvd6TmSd7bniQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271585/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="84BbK6"&gt;T-Mobile promised its $26 billion merger with Sprint would add new jobs to the economy literally every single day, but a report from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobiles-hiring-pledge-is-off-to-a-slow-start-11620639002"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirms the newly combined company actually employs fewer people now than it did before the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkS7F9"&gt;Here’s how specific &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fnew-t-mobile-creating-jobs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22429587%2Ft-mobile-sprint-merge-jobs-promise-pandemic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s promise was&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NkdxSM"&gt;So, let me be really clear on this increasingly important topic. &lt;strong&gt;This merger is all about creating new, high-quality, high-paying jobs, and the New T-Mobile will be jobs-positive from Day One and every day thereafter.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not just a promise. That’s not just a commitment. It’s a fact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ny04YG"&gt;“Jobs-positive” would not be how I’d describe T-Mobile’s employment practices. The company employed 5,000 fewer people by the end of 2020 than it did before the merger, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes. And before you blame the COVID-19 pandemic, you should know that  wireless executives who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that shrinking the number of jobs was always part of the plan — the pandemic just sped up planned &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/coronavirus-retail-workforce-faces-permanent-decline.html"&gt;job loss on the retail side&lt;/a&gt; of T-Mobile’s business. In fact, T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293293/tmobile-sprint-merger-layoffs-hundreds-biso-jobs-cut"&gt;laid off hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of Sprint’s inside sales team just a few months after its merger was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaabC"&gt;In addition to the “jobs-positive from day one and every day thereafter” claim, which now appears to have been a blatant lie, T-Mobile also specifically promised it would add 11,000 jobs by 2024. Instead, it appears to be moving in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYQ9p5"&gt;We were warned this would happen. &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-sprint-t-mobile-merger-jobs-20171010-story.html"&gt;Wall Street analysts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/sprint-t-mobile-merger-could-lead-thousands-job-losses-despite-n1134956"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt; both predicted anywhere between 24,000 to 30,000 jobs could be lost if T-Mobile and Sprint got what they wanted. Telecom industry watcher Karl Bode wrote multiple articles for &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;highlighting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage"&gt;how meaningless&lt;/a&gt; the merger promises looked, comparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962739/t-mobile-sprint-nextel-merger-prices-rural-coverage-promises"&gt;Sprint’s own history&lt;/a&gt; of post-merger layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v096vD"&gt;For some context, when Sprint was given the go-ahead to merge with Nextel in 2005, it made its own claims about how great its merger would be for the economy. Bode writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Lg96K1"&gt;Government filings had promised the FCC that the deal would “generate economic growth and jobs in the United States.” Then-Sprint CEO Gary Forsee told media outlets in 2005 that employees “shouldn’t expect to see a headline that there’s thousands of jobs that are going to be cut on the first of November or any time along the way.” By the end, more than 8,000 employees would lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OTOPMm"&gt;Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xre29K"&gt;T-Mobile’s other merger obligations, like helping Dish become a viable fourth carrier option, also seem like they might just be talk. Dish CEO Charlie Ergen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;recently told the FCC&lt;/a&gt; that if T-Mobile moves forward with its plans to shut down its older 3G CDMA network, Dish’s Boost Mobile customers (who rely on Sprint’s network for service) would be greatly harmed. Ergen stresses that for customers who need the less expensive phone plans Boost provides, upgrading to a 4G or 5G-capable phone isn’t a small expense — it could force some people to go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AeidX3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dish chairman calls T-Mobile the ‘Grinch’ for going back on merger promises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5zarQA"&gt;As far as jobs are concerned, current T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert does tell the J&lt;em&gt;ournal&lt;/em&gt; that the company plans to fill 6,000 open positions as the world recovers from the pandemic. That might possibly bring T-Mobile/Sprint back up to its pre-merger numbers, but it’s now even harder to believe the company will add an additional 11,000 jobs by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H9k0m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung and Lenovo are the latest to ditch a physical Mobile World Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLp3y9"&gt;Samsung and Lenovo representatives won’t show up in person to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year, according to statements obtained &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-will-attend-barcelonas-world-mobile-congress-remotely-la-vanguardia-2021-05-11/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSEF82"&gt;Samsung says it has “made the decision to withdraw from exhibiting in-person” and will instead attend remotely to prioritize the health and safety of its customers and employees.  A Lenovo spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company will attend virtually instead of in person and that it informed the GSM Association, which organizes the event, about its plans on Friday. Neither company has announced what its remote presence will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMKwuD"&gt;The in-person event is still scheduled to happen in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and difficulties with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421558/us-covid-coronavirus-vaccines-patent-waiver"&gt;vaccination availability outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. The GSMA also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;fought against shutting down last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; early on in 2020 before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;several big brands dropped out&lt;/a&gt;. This year, we’ve already seen Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;announce that it won’t be exhibiting&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to Samsung and Lenovo’s remote announcements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FY6fwj"&gt;Other notable companies have dropped out from the in-person conference as well, including &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nokia-joins-ericsson-in-bailing-on-mwc-with-oracle-sony-also-reportedly-out-/d/d-id/767983"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/ericsson-bails-mwc-barcelona-2021"&gt;Ericsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/mwc-june-2021-barcelona-in-person-sony-nokia-ericsson-oracle-220004011.html"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.telecomtv.com/content/sustainability/what-s-up-with-oracle-mwc-orange-ofcom-5g-spectrum-apple-41023/"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2zZY"&gt;We’ve reached out to several other large brands about their attendance plans, including ZTE, and Huawei, which haven’t responded to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKhKfy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 11th, 5:21PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Lenovo confirmed to The Verge that it won’t attend MWC 2021 in person. Headline and copy have been updated to reflect. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First commercial-scale offshore wind farm in the US gets federal approval</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deepwater wind farm off Block Island, Rhode Island" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S5eZMW7zC2TxtJ0Ix994rCoxKzQ=/111x0:2079x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69271108/1316070124.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Block Island, R.I.: Deepwater Wind offshore wind farm at Block Island, Rhode Island on August 14, 2016. | Photo by Mark Harrington/Newsday RM via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pk70yU"&gt;The first commercial-scale offshore wind project in the US just got the green light from the Biden administration. The approval has the potential to dramatically grow the nation’s wind energy sector after years of regulatory limbo for proposed offshore projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="j5J9m0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big ambitions for offshore wind&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3g26hM"&gt;The Interior Department (DOI) granted the Vineyard Wind project permission to install up to 84 turbines off the coast of Massachusetts. Once completed, the project will be able to generate up to 800 megawatts (MW), enough electricity for 400,000 homes. That’s a dramatic scaling up of existing offshore wind capacity in the US. There are currently only two small developments off the East Coast and those can only&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;generate a combined 42 megawatts of electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyAgaj"&gt;The Biden administration has big ambitions for offshore wind. It set a goal of getting 30,000 MW of energy from offshore wind by 2030. That’s part of a bigger plan to tackle climate change by reaching 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWpmE4"&gt;“A clean energy future is within our grasp in the United States. The approval of this project is an important step toward advancing the Administration’s goals to create good-paying union jobs while combatting climate change and powering our nation,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UG0UF6"&gt;Europe is already ahead of the game, with more than &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271055/cumulative-european-offshore-wind-power-capacity-installations/#:~:text=Europe's%20cumulative%20offshore%20wind%20energy,European%20water%20bodies%20in%202006."&gt;25,000 MW&lt;/a&gt; of offshore wind capacity now. Globally, wind and solar energy are taking off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when it comes to electricity generation. New renewable energy capacity made up 90 percent of the global power sector’s growth in 2020 and is expected to do so again in 2021 and 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;according to a market update released today by the International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CfKqK2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Globally, wind and solar energy are taking off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAPwlf"&gt;Vineyard Wind first submitted its construction and operations plan for federal approval in 2017, although plans for the project have been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2021/3/8/vineyard-wind-statement-on-release-of-final-environmental-impact-statement"&gt;since 2009&lt;/a&gt;. Now that the project has been greenlit, it’s expected to be operational by 2023, according to the project’s developers, Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQBApe"&gt;Vineyard Wind receiving a Record of Decision from the DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is likely a good sign for more than a dozen other offshore wind projects awaiting federal approval. It’s good news for adjacent industries, too, including shipbuilding.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There’s been a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296979/us-offshore-ships-wind-boom-installation-vessels"&gt;“chicken and egg” situation for the offshore wind&lt;/a&gt; industry: it needs specialized vessels to construct new projects, but shipbuilders were hesitant to invest in new builds until major projects received permits to move forward. Vineyard Wind’s approval could be wind in the sails to get both industries really moving. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Rd4yA"&gt;Wyze, maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21726548/wyze-watch-44-47-smartwatch-price-release-date-features"&gt;$20 smartwatches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450637/wyze-headphones-video-doorbell-c-pricing-release-date"&gt;$30 video doorbells&lt;/a&gt;, has announced &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-buds-pro.html"&gt;a new pair of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that include active noise cancellation and a Qi wireless charging case for only $60 (&lt;a href="https://phandroid.com/2021/05/11/the-wyze-buds-pro-bring-active-noise-cancellation-and-alexa-for-just-60/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Phandroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). They’re called the Wyze Buds Pro and come in at an incredibly low price when compared to the competition: you could buy four pairs of these for the price of Apple’s AirPods Pro, which have similar features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAdheL"&gt;For comparison: &lt;a href="https://us.soundcore.com/collections/true-wireless/products/a3902"&gt;Anker’s $60 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; come without ANC or wireless charging (instead using Micro USB, where the Wyze buds also include a USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q41FQU"&gt;Wyze’s announcement video takes a decidedly self-aware bent, but while it does mention the sweat resistance, transparency mode, and wind noise reduction, it doesn’t mention one of the funniest things about the product’s name: it’s called “Pro,” but there aren’t any Wyze Buds non-pros to compare them against (though Wyze does &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WyzeCam/status/1392162656191016960?s=20"&gt;say a pair is coming&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3JR4r7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n3TlUy8vC98?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CA2Mv"&gt;I may poke fun, but, on paper at least, these earbuds are competing way above their price. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;SoundCore Liberty Air 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; (what a name) from Anker and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WTWYS4?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds second-gen from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both considered to be budget picks for true-wireless earbuds with ANC, and those are in the $100+ price range. Amazon charges an extra $20 for a wireless charging case for the Echo Buds, something that Wyze includes. To add insult to injury for Amazon, the Wyze Buds Pro also have Alexa built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtoGrW"&gt;Of course, some of the most important functions of earbuds are how they sound and whether the ANC is actually any good. Given that we haven’t actually heard them yet, these earbuds haven’t proven themselves in either category. But if they end up being good, or even passable, they’ll be a solid deal for those who want all the fancy features without having to pay top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fo5qP1"&gt;The Wyze Buds Pro are currently available for preorder, and Wyze says they will start shipping in July.&lt;/p&gt;
