    <title>A company wants to build a massive solar project in Montana — of course it’s for crypto</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tW0wB4"&gt;A company looking to build a massive solar project in Butte, Montana claims it would provide 300MW of renewable power and cost $250 million, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-solar-crypto-mine-plan-is-stranger-than-fiction-1846966085"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. That’s according to Madison River Equity LLC, whose parent company &lt;a href="https://mtstandard.com/news/local/giant-solar-project-proposed-in-south-butte-landowners-concerned/article_653a61a1-d565-5f21-9639-0052f3df86e7.html"&gt;also manages cryptomining outfit Atlas Power&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;reports, Madison would build the solar array, then sell it to Atlas, which hopes to use it to power its cryptocurrency mining operations. If the solar farm, dubbed the Basin Creek Solar Project, is actually built, it could be one of the largest in the US, but it raises questions about the impact of such projects, and about crypto’s impact on energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60fFMI"&gt;While the project would theoretically allow Atlas’ mining and other data center operations to run on renewable power, there are arguments that green energy doesn’t actually make crypto itself green. There’s still the problem of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;e-waste that’s generated when hardware is no longer profitable&lt;/a&gt;, and the question of what will happen if there isn’t enough solar power available to fuel the mining operation. And while the massive solar project does seem to be in line with the goals of some (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451900/elon-musk-bitcoin-miners-council-sustainability"&gt;including Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;) in the crypto community who are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373524/cryptocurrency-climate-accord-bitcoin-carbon-footprint"&gt;trying to move away from fossil-fuel powered mining operations&lt;/a&gt;, it also shows the problems that can crop up when trying to create a green energy project, especially one that will be run by a company focusing on crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2k8qG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mtstandard.com/news/local/giant-solar-project-proposed-in-south-butte-landowners-concerned/article_653a61a1-d565-5f21-9639-0052f3df86e7.html"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Montana Standard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Butte-Silver Bow zoning board recently turned down another energy project that was also looking to use residential land, citing nearby residents’ aesthetic concerns. The &lt;em&gt;Standard&lt;/em&gt;’s report also includes similar concerns from Butte residents about ruined views regarding the Basin Creek Solar Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3HjLP"&gt;There are also some community members concerned about whether the extra electricity generated will actually benefit Butte, or if it will be sold elsewhere. Add to that the allegedly colorful past of Atlas Power’s owners — the company &lt;a href="https://mtstandard.com/news/local/atlas-power-kevin-washingtons-emerging-data-and-energy-vision/article_85d3a633-4a8a-5196-80c4-5f4a9a866ec2.html"&gt;used to be called CryptoWatt&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s understandable why residents would be wary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A32lX8"&gt;At the moment, the fate of the Basin Creek Solar Project (and possibly the fate of Atlas Energy’s mining expansion) seem to be in the hands of the Butte-Silver Bow zoning board, which will meet on June 17th to discuss whether to allow the solar array to be built on what is currently private land.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Industry groups sue to stop Florida’s new social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Holds News Conference In Miami" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9PlbO4oCVGw__P_iykqdT1IMy4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352761/1311497710.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LU2mm"&gt;Two tech industry organizations have &lt;a href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SB-7072-One-Pager-1.pdf"&gt;sued Florida&lt;/a&gt; over its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451425/florida-social-media-moderation-facebook-twitter-deplatforming"&gt;newly passed rules&lt;/a&gt; for social networks. NetChoice and the CCIA — which represent Amazon, Google, Intel, Samsung, Facebook, and other tech giants — say SB 7072 violates private companies’ constitutional rights. They’re asking a court to prevent the law from taking effect, calling it a “frontal assault on the First Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKypyf"&gt;SB 7072, which Florida Governor Ron DeSantis &lt;a href="https://www.flgov.com/2021/05/24/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-to-stop-the-censorship-of-floridians-by-big-tech/"&gt;signed earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, restricts how large social apps and websites can moderate user-generated content. It makes banning any Florida political candidate or “journalistic enterprise” unlawful, lets users sue if they believe they were banned without sufficient reason, requires an option to “opt out” of sorting algorithms, and places companies that break the law on an “antitrust violator blacklist” that bars them from doing business with public entities in Florida. Notably, it includes an exception for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;companies that operate a theme park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="STpCNW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A frontal assault on the First Amendment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eAP8j"&gt;NetChoice and the CCIA say SB 7072 conflicts with both constitutional protections and federal Section 230 rules. “As private businesses, Plaintiffs’ members have the right to decide what content is appropriate for their sites and platforms,” &lt;a href="https://netchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NetChoice-CCIA-Complaint-for-Declaratory-and-Injunctive-Relief-5.27.21.pdf"&gt;their complaint says&lt;/a&gt;. “The Act requires members to display and prioritize user-generated content that runs counter to their terms, policies, and business practices; content that will likely offend and repel their users and advertisers; and even content that is unlawful, dangerous to public health and national security, and grossly inappropriate for younger audiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEm7vK"&gt;The lawsuit claims Florida lawmakers and DeSantis specifically tailored the law to punish services whose moderation policies they disagreed with, while adding the arbitrary theme park exception to pacify Disney, Comcast NBCUniversal, and a handful of other big companies. “The law is crony capitalism masquerading as consumer protection,” said NetChoice vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBsB2L"&gt;The law’s supporters argue it fights “deplatforming” of users based on political speech, saying social networks have “morphed into the town square” and become public spaces. Courts have contradicted the latter claim outside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20688860/trump-loss-knight-institute-second-circuit-court-twitter-block-lawsuit-analysis"&gt;extremely specific exceptions&lt;/a&gt;, determining that Section 230 mostly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272066/social-media-bias-laura-loomer-larry-klayman-twitter-google-facebook-loss"&gt;lets social networks&lt;/a&gt; make their own moderation decisions — and states can’t simply supersede that federal rule. However, the Florida bill let lawmakers and DeSantis signal support for a Republican backlash against Silicon Valley, whether or not it actually takes effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this incredible web series about a Cyberpunk Salad Merchant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PRYrb23zfl5Ma-doa_AVj7TqMlo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352726/dynamoDreams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BHq5k8"&gt;After three years of production, Ian Hubert, king of the one-minute Blender tutorial, has uploaded &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGZ_2RuJ2A"&gt;the first episode&lt;/a&gt; of his sci-fi series, &lt;em&gt;Dynamo Dream&lt;/em&gt;. And it’s been worth the wait. The series is a mix of live-action and CGI that follows a salad merchant on a seemingly normal day through the dense streets of the Sunset District, a futuristic metropolis filled with fax machine drones, giant mutant crabs blocking traffic, and flying assassin bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2T1vf"&gt;The episode is visually stunning and seems to be endlessly filled with details. Every frame can be paused and observed, each containing hints to an expansive world that stretches beyond the camera’s frame. The world is convincing and surprisingly charming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HcLJR"&gt;While bearing resemblance to other gritty dystopias, the folky music, calm atmosphere, and moments of pause let you know that humanity isn’t totally lost in the world of &lt;em&gt;Dynamo Dream&lt;/em&gt;. There are still small joys to be found in the hustle and bustle. This continues into the protagonist, a merchant with a green thumb who sells salads in mugs. She’s a flower growing out of the cracks of the concrete, though things may not stay peaceful for long. Hopefully it won’t take another three years to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dfDOmZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFJ_THGj72U?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shdszH"&gt;Over the years, Hubert has shared behind-the-scenes looks at this project and has become a well-known figure in the 3D art community — namely, for making impressive work with ingenious animation methods spotlighted in his Lazy Tutorials series on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmxZRQk-X0p-TOxd6PEYJA"&gt;his YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. His videos show you how to make a lot out of a little, often in under a minute’s time. Even more impressively, all 3D models used in this series were created using Blender, a free 3D package. Compositing was done using Adobe’s After Effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IW9Rg"&gt;You can check out a few of those tutorials below and support Hubert through his &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/IanHubert"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, where he shares tutorials and 3D assets with his patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s fantastic Chromebook Spin 713 is $329 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ls9459Dk7Ed5zSMBhuRyEsAKPic=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352519/mchin_181029_4126_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A84CFr"&gt;Acer just announced a new iteration of its Chromebook Spin 713 2-in-1 laptop, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;we’ve already reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps by coincidence (or not), the previous model has received a big price cut at Best Buy. You can get the starting model for $329, and it offers much more than many other Chromebooks in this price range. My colleague Monica Chin currently rates this 2020 Spin 713 as the best Chromebook that you can buy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;Check out their buying guide&lt;/a&gt; to see how it stacks up to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgWQcw"&gt;The Spin 713 has a 13.5-inch 2K (2256 x 1504) 3:2 aspect ratio display that can show more content at once than comparatively squished 16:9 screens. Its battery life and build quality are great, and its 10th Gen Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage should provide a smooth experience for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H0r0tt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qdleG2"&gt;In case this deal seems familiar, we covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/19/22443621/roku-streambar-acer-chromebook-apple-watch-se-iphone-11-pro-deal-sale"&gt;a similar offer last week&lt;/a&gt; for the Spin 713 for $429, but that was for the upgraded model that has an i5 processor, and double the RAM and storage counts. That deal isn’t happening, unfortunately, but this is still a fantastic offer if you’re willing to take a small hit in those departments. The difference in performance isn’t likely to be drastic, but if you push your hardware to the limit, it might be worth waiting for another deal on the step-up configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uFKJdP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9dwY3P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart adds faster ‘Priority Delivery’ which is sure to cause headaches for delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Veq3veLI3hoW8idIbnGnopaLqN8=/181x0:2149x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352298/Priority_Delivery.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instacart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JPXqm0"&gt;In the crowded food- and grocery-delivery space, Instacart is hoping that shaving off a few minutes makes all the difference. To that end, it’s creating a new “priority delivery” option that debuts today in select markets and promises to have orders fulfilled in “as fast as 30 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNL11G"&gt;While 45- and 60-minute deliveries are already available to many Instacart customers, “priority delivery” is, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Fcompany%2Fpressreleases%2Finstacart-launches-priority-delivery-introduces-30-minute-grocery-delivery%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22456907%2Finstacart-priority-delivery-faster-orders-new-feature" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;, debuting in more than 15 cities (though it only names six: Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle). It’s intended use case is for quick errands, rather than the bulk, groceries-for-the-week function Instacart tends to thrive on. With that in mind, even in participating stores, the 30-minute option will become unavailable for orders that are overly large or complicated, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IO5e5"&gt;As is true for many delivery jobs, small orders, like the ones “priority” is designed for, are typically the least lucrative and often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"&gt;remain in the queue&lt;/a&gt; of unclaimed work for longer. For many drivers, picking up these small potatoes orders aren’t worth the gas they’d spend getting to the store. Naturally, faster service will also cost more — though the pricing for “priority” is as yet unknown. Instacart declined to provide details on how much the upcharge is expected to be, or how much of it will make its way into delivery workers’ paychecks. Instacart also did not say whether it was increasing staffing or making workflow changes to accommodate any needs specific to “priority delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSFiWD"&gt;It’s reasonable to be wary of how this new feature, with its even more strenuous time demands, might impact an already strained and vulnerable workforce. This is, after all, the same company that was found to be subsidizing workers’ wages with their own tip money; it’s also the company that, to some degree, still allows customers to engage in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281910/instacart-tip-baiting-changes-congress-inquiry-exploitation-covid-19"&gt;the abhorrent practice of tip baiting&lt;/a&gt;, whereby delivery workers are enticed to grab an order with a generous tip, only to have it rescinded after the order is completed. This is to say nothing of Instacart’s feelings about workers getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242676/instacart-firing-every-union-employee-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;employee status or collective bargaining rights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYBn3s"&gt;Completing a delivery within half an hour may not seem like a huge strain, especially for Instacart shoppers already working in metros with 45-minute turnarounds. But in the precarity of gig work, customer ratings can mean the difference between having a job or &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-12-21/instacart-shoppers-ratings-returns-missing-orders"&gt;being deactivated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="wpPO1x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10521953"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;You played us all, Charlie | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HDCYT" target="_blank"&gt;Image: HDCYT on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rL4ndP"&gt;It’s hard to describe the absolute chaos around NFTs (non-fungible tokens) right now; tech reporters’ inboxes are flooded with the latest and stupidest additions to this trend of digital certificates for memes and other pieces of digital memorabilia. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;Disaster Girl&lt;/a&gt; sold for around $500,000, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322131/nyan-cat-creator-nft-memes-memeconomy"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt; went for about $64,400, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat&lt;/a&gt; brought in around $590,000. But most NFTs aren’t all that noteworthy, and we can’t possibly write about every single one (despite this sentence, my inbox will now be flooded with NFT pitches for the next two months). But despite our attempts to be judicious and write about newsworthy topics, we can’t win them all.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvJB8T"&gt;We wrote about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22437088/charlie-bit-my-finger-video-nft-deletion-youtube-auction"&gt;Charlie Bit Me NFT auction&lt;/a&gt; because it had a twist the others did not: the seller said it would be leaving the internet “forever,” deleted from YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM"&gt;where it currently has more than 880 million views&lt;/a&gt; once the auction ended. But &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2014092/charlie-bit-me-wont-be-leaving-youtube-after-all-father-says/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s another surprise twist: Howard Davies-Carr, the father of the children in the 14-year-old clip, which sold for about $761,000, says it will stay on YouTube after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XSf1k2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OBlgSz8sSM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WYCMfX"&gt;“After the auction we connected with the buyer, who ended up deciding to keep the video on YouTube,” Davies-Carr told &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;. “The buyer felt that the video is an important part of popular culture and shouldn’t be taken down. It will now live on YouTube for the masses to continue enjoying as well as memorialized as an NFT on the blockchain.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMftyN"&gt;I guess that’s nice and all but if you didn’t want to abide by the rules you could have simply— not bid on it in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GPiGei"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPS2fz"&gt;Okay so, listen, internet. We try to accept that things change and opinions shift and nothing is forever, but we have to lay down some rules about NFTs, in my humble Gen X opinion. Charlie and his brother are really cute (or were in 2007), but this isn’t even one of the most clever or interesting memes on the internet if we’re being brutally honest. Spend your money on whatever you like, but if the seller says the meme will be gone forever to attract buyers and eyeballs, they’re setting certain expectations, and when you change the rules last minute it leads to chaos and confusion and grumpy editors.  Not to mention the confusion you’re creating among buyers. Now instead of one Charlie, you’ve increased the supply to infinite Charlies — something the other prospective buyers might have liked to know before they decided to bid.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUtSUL"&gt;I guess it’s not all that surprising that a blockchain-related product might overpromise and then under-deliver, but I’m fairly certain this last-minute switcheroo will just encourage ever more ridiculous stunts for people to get coverage and buyers for their NFTs. Which will probably result in less coverage in tech media because no one wants to get burned — or in this case, bitten — by a story that doesn’t live up to the hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGWzNs"&gt;Charlie, good going, my young friend. In the end, you bit us all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s WF-1000XM4s wireless earbuds leak again with all-new water resistance and ‘V1’ chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyySQ7W2HL4FMwGlEMd_Lk9ac_Y=/44x0:617x382/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352021/Sony_WF_1000XM4_1622109809_1_12.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What appears to be an official photo of the Sony WF-1000XM4s.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,123155.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GJPyDl"&gt;We heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428676/sony-1000xm4-earbuds-leak"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that Sony may be planning to launch its next noise-canceling true wireless earbuds, the WF-1000XM4s, as early as June, and thanks to new leaks &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123155.html"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we might now know almost all of the specs for the upcoming buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMArDx"&gt;Like the very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;previous-gen WF-1000XM3s&lt;/a&gt;, the new WF-1000XM4s will offer active noise cancelation (ANC), but thanks to a new “Sony V1” processor, ANC performance will be improved, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports. The headphones will also support Sony’s LDAC codec, which lets you listen to high-quality audio over Bluetooth, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dsyqsf"&gt;And it sounds like the new 1000XM4s will have a very good battery life, like the 1000XM3s. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says you’ll be able to get eight hours of battery on a single charge with ANC on and 12 hours with ANC off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHJJ8n"&gt;Additionally, the 1000XM4s have an IPX4-rating for water and sweat resistance, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture. &lt;/em&gt;That would be a nice improvement over the WF-1000XM3s, which weren’t certified for water resistance at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbqPVL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; also shared many official-looking renders of the 1000XM4s, which look to match &lt;a href="https://thewalkmanblog.blogspot.com/2021/05/sony-wf-1000xm4-full-design-leaked.html?m=1"&gt;previously shared&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445281/sony-wf-1000xm4-true-wireless-earbuds-leak-images-specs-details-rumors"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of an all-new design. I’ve collected a few of the renders in the gallery below, but you should check out &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123155.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture’s&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; to see a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZeZkR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10521987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iB5j3N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says the 1000XM4s will go on sale in Europe soon for €279.90, but it didn’t give a US price. The 1000XM3s launched in the US at $229.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kellogg’s is introducing a cereal robot to make the easiest food to prepare even easier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lo0Qx_8u2Szr-FF1doaQeTskQ_U=/70x22:613x384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69351985/UW_Madison.60ae3bc77d0ef.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Kellog’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f0l1xs"&gt;Kellogg’s — legal guardian of such cereal mascots as Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam — &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/kelloggsawayfromhome/videos/introducing-the-kelloggs-bowl-bot/4176505945748995/"&gt;has partnered&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272746/doordash-chowbotics-acquisition-salad-robot"&gt;DoorDash-owned Chowbotics&lt;/a&gt; to launch a new cereal-mixing robot at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Florida State University (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/kelloggs-introduces-robotic-vending-machines-that-mix-a-1846981993"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Kellogg’s Bowl Bot offers a vending machine-type experience for one of the simplest breakfast foods, and charges anywhere from $2.99 to $6.50 for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAYxGj"&gt;The Bowl Bot could be best thought of as an extension of Chowbotics’ earlier &lt;a href="https://www.chowbotics.com/our-solutions/"&gt;“Sally” fresh food and salad robot&lt;/a&gt;. You interact with it via a touchscreen to select through your dairy bases (milk or yogurt), combinations of cereals and granolas, and toppings like fresh fruit or cocoa nibs. Kellogg’s also offers custom pre-designed combinations of cereals at a higher price if something like the “Hawaii 5-0” (Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bear Naked Fit Triple Berry Granola, pineapple, coconut, and mango) sounds better than what you can come up with on your own. While Bowl Bot seems to offer plenty of options, there’s some more human preferences it might not account for, like adding less milk to avoid soggy cereal. Kellogg’s tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that currently Bowl Bot uses pre-set amounts of milk and yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RnHM5"&gt;Applying the &lt;a href="https://www.coca-colafreestyle.com/"&gt;Coca-Cola Freestyle&lt;/a&gt; soda machine experience to cereal makes some amount of sense. It takes up less space than a cereal bar and theoretically eliminates the need for individual boxes and walk-ins full of milk. It does also seem like a way to further nickel-and-dime students through a kind of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/30/5857030/keurig-digital-rights-management-coffee-pod-pirates"&gt;food DRM&lt;/a&gt;.” Each college will handle its meal plans differently, but I’d be pretty annoyed if my unlimited cereal-for-dinner lifestyle got saddled with $3-per-bowl microtransactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNQrYn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 27th, 3:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with response from Kellogg’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this investigation into the real death toll from the Texas freeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deep Freeze Power Crisis In Texas Is Expanding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DkoxXRkf8Pd5bckqDG0By78-RQo=/0x0:4713x3142/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69351590/1231215587.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A truck drives down the street during a power outage in McKinney, Texas, U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2021. Blackouts left almost 5 million customers without electricity that day, while refineries and oil wells were shut during unprecedented freezing weather.  | Cooper Neill/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="roPfOW"&gt;Hundreds more people died in Texas during the February deep freeze and blackouts than the state’s official count shows, according to an investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/texas-winter-storm-power-outage-death-toll"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The outages left millions of people without power as indoor temperatures dropped to deadly lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wIry0T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The way authorities typically count death tolls from disasters tends to drastically low-ball the actual losses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WNvsw7"&gt;Texas has so far acknowledged &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news/updates.shtm#wn"&gt;151&lt;/a&gt; winter storm-related deaths. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;News&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, found that an estimated 700 people lost their lives from the combined catastrophes of the storm and power outages. The news outlet conducted a thorough analysis of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;data that showed how many more people died around that time than would normally be expected. It’s the most recent analysis to show that the way authorities typically count death tolls from disasters tends to drastically low-ball the actual losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="om64e7"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;, the Texas Department of State Health Services counted mostly deaths from hypothermia, accidents involving ice, and &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/29/texas-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/"&gt;carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/a&gt; (people turned on cars and grills inside their homes in desperate attempts to stay warm). But hypothermia is “notoriously difficult to diagnose,” Hannah Jarvis, assistant medical examiner at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;. And the deaths of people who were already vulnerable to extreme cold and stress because of underlying medical conditions flew under the radar of Texas officials, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4OBbi"&gt;Many of their death records point to those conditions, like cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as the cause of death. But family members and roommates who were there for their loved ones’ last, shivering moments say the freezing cold was to blame. “I still believe the cold made him to where his heart just gave out,” one grieving widow, Mary Gonzales, tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQv8cx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;News&lt;/em&gt; modeled how many deaths are expected in a given week, using long-term and seasonal trends. Then it compared that to actual deaths recorded by the CDC to find out how many more people likely died because of the storm and blackouts (and subtracted deaths from COVID-19). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIScL8"&gt;Similar studies revealed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;how many people really died during Hurricane Maria and the blackouts that followed. Puerto Rico changed its official death count from 64 to 2,975 following public outrage over its initial underestimate and after a more in-depth &lt;a href="http://prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/files/reports/Acertainment%20of%20the%20Estimated%20Excess%20Mortality%20from%20Hurricane%20Maria%20in%20Puerto%20Rico.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by George Washington University arrived at the higher number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OLywEG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This story is about more than numbers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QvxzwF"&gt;“We now know that the Texas government’s repeated failure to modernize our energy systems killed over 700 Texans in February’s winter storm,” former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1397756534332002306"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, calling for more action from lawmakers to harden the state’s energy system from climate change and more extreme weather. Many energy companies chose not to steel the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;state’s energy infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; against bouts of cold weather, even after a similarly brutal 2011 cold snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0FOyV"&gt;In the end, this story is about more than numbers. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; talked to families who are still fighting for justice after losing those they loved. Many were unable to qualify for support from FEMA because their death certificates didn’t mention the winter storm. Failing to officially acknowledge their deaths also puts lives at risk in future disasters, because public health officials aren’t able to see all the vulnerabilities that played out during the storm. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; shows what the state missed; read the &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/texas-winter-storm-power-outage-death-toll"&gt;full story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i75zcs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, the multiplayer game that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;soared in popularity&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic, is the latest free title on the Epic Games Store. If you have an account for that storefront, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/among-us"&gt;you can download it for free until June 3rd&lt;/a&gt; (it normally costs $5).

The game supports cross-platform multiplayer, so players of the Android, iOS, PC, and Nintendo Switch versions can play together. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;The PS4 and PS5 versions&lt;/a&gt; of the game will support crossplay, too, once it launches later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
