    <title>Google Photos now lets you set a changing wallpaper that pulls images from your memories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MO_Bg18DwZNEv_C95AYK4biQwus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449069/1BEB77B1_EB2C_4E1F_A9C1_1B863908E956.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t3IMGi"&gt;Android users who are bored of their usual wallpapers are in luck: an update to Google Photos now allows users to set their wallpaper as a random, rotating cast of saved photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE8l3J"&gt;Version 5.22 of Google Photos automatically includes the update, so if you go to your phone’s wallpaper selector and look at the live wallpapers, you should see the option for one called “Memories.” Once selected, your phone will start pulling photos from the Memories section of Google Photos to cycle between as a background. You’ll then be able to preview what you’ll see as a wallpaper before confirming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SekiEk"&gt;The main catch here is that Google defines what &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/relive-your-best-memories-new-features-google-photos"&gt;counts as a memory&lt;/a&gt; based on its machine learning algorithms, so you won’t be able to really decide what shows up. Photos could range from gorgeous vistas to a photo of your sad home office lunch. Who knows! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oEW9b"&gt;Of course, you might as well try this out now if you’re ever going to, considering Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;is eliminating&lt;/a&gt; unlimited, free photo storage on June 1st, 2021. Google Photos will start charging for storage over 15GB, which is beyond a bummer. If you think you might end up switching services, now’s the time to try out a live wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Complex turned its fashion and music festival into a futuristic video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6dv-MSJBwUJ1ZlripOv5BUiVgTo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448969/INTRO_RENDER_08.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A week of sneakers, panels, and... virtual food trucks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SvPdhu"&gt;Since 2016, ComplexCon has been a place where streetwear enthusiasts can gather in one place to buy exclusive gear, listen to amazing live music, and gorge at high-end food trucks. As with most live shows, though, the event isn’t taking place in 2020 — at least, not in the traditional way. In lieu of an in-person festival in Long Beach, Complex has built a video game where users can shop, watch talks and performances, and, yes, order from local restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmfkO6"&gt;It’s not a sprawling virtual world where millions can gather in one place, but rather a single-player experience designed to mimic the feeling of being at a live show. ComplexLand is a video game where the main activity is shopping, and you chase after sneaker drops like a hero in the latest open-world blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev9q1Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://complexland.com/"&gt;ComplexLand&lt;/a&gt; will take place from December 7th–11th, and it’s completely free. The experience was built in WebGL, meaning it’s accessible via a web browser, either on desktop or mobile. Once you create an account, you’re dropped into a sort of abstract, futuristic cityscape and immediately prompted to create an avatar, choosing from various brandname hats and sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1gDUd"&gt;From there, the experience opens up, with a big world full of NPCs to talk to and points of interest to explore. To emulate some of the social experience, there will also be a persistent chat where attendees can talk about the day’s events. Most importantly: there are plenty of places to shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="QGHljW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GyQ_sOZ9jU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMNSQ1"&gt;Complex’s head of collaborations, Neil Wright, says the creative team was inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott’s appearance in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but they felt one key thing was missing. “Aesthetically, I thought it looked really cool. It was so over the top and whimsical in a way that was really creative,” Wright explains. “I think, for us, the one thing that it lacked was the commerce aspect. If you wanted to buy any of the merch, you had to go to Travis’ website. You had to go elsewhere for it. So when we were building this world, we wanted to make sure that commerce was top of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmG--dK0Iv9PRu56Phl0aVBkalI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141171/AVATAR_02_0020.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVXsLX"&gt;ComplexLand is essentially a game built entirely around shopping. Yes, you can watch talks where Fat Joe and Lil Yachty discuss the best sneakers of the year or listen to T-Pain’s thoughts on the future of esports. (All of the talks will be broadcast via YouTube Live.) But you’re also running through a sci-fi city in search of the latest gear. Complex has partnered with fashion brands like Adidas, BAPE, and Tokidoki for virtual booths that users can visit to shop for exclusive sneakers or hoodies. Everything is branded and shoppable: there are artists booths where individuals can sell their work, or you can pop by a Perrier booth plastered with Takashi Murakami’s iconic smiling flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cXdN5"&gt;The experience also gamifies that ever-present part of streetwear culture: the limited drop. As players are exploring the world, they’ll get notifications that a new drop is about to happen. From there, it works sort of like an open-world game like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt;. Your mini-map will show you the general area where the drop can be found, but it’s up to you to actually find it. If you manage to, you’ll be entered into a queue for the opportunity to buy whatever the item is. “In my perfect scenario, your avatar will be shopping around, and then you’ll be alerted that a drop is going to occur. And you have to stop what you’re doing and then try to locate it in the world,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qVb-hCiWu12oxpDD33ccaBR9iTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141163/ComplexLand_2020___Google_Chrome_2020_12_02_at_6.48.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZB8B3"&gt;Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of ComplexLand is the food trucks. You’ll be able to go up to a virtual truck, order food, and have it delivered to your house. Here’s how Wright describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nrdFDa"&gt;It’s something that we really wanted to make sure we were able to execute on because the food trucks at ComplexCon are such an important part because the restaurants that we choose are really top-tier. Basically, what you’ll be able to do is, when you’re in the world, we’ll have four food trucks all based around things like burgers or tacos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWD6GS"&gt;At that point, your avatar will approach the truck, and you’ll be able to see menu items that are region-specific — so if you’re in New York, you get the New York burger, and if you’re in Chicago, you get the Chicago burger — and then we’ll work with the restaurant to have that item available through their delivery platform. Once you select the menu, you’ll be connected to the restaurant’s food delivery service of choice, and it’ll be delivered to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gXekud"&gt;ComplexLand represents the confluence of several trends, from events going virtual to the collision of fashion and gaming. Both of these became more prominent in 2020, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;Balenciaga making a game to show off its next clothing line&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;Lil Nas X performing inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238703/animal-crossing-new-horizons-streetwear-fashion-outfits-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; fans working together to design in-game streetwear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFtTXI"&gt;ComplexLand differs in some ways because it’s so overtly commercial, designed explicitly for shopping, but that could also be indicative of the future of virtual worlds. After all, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s continued growth has been built largely off of pop culture collaborations with Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Brands are everywhere. ComplexLand simply embraces this fact more than most. And while it was designed initially for a week-long event, it could also end up being a more permanent virtual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PqOXt6"&gt;“We built it with the objective that we would probably bring it back,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the best Nintendo Switch deal you’ll find this holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APQAtVw2YL5h_5I0Nv3HdQtBdQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448780/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_mario.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZ0yJN"&gt;Some of the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come and gone, but with the holidays just around the corner, there are still a ton of deals readily available at various retailers. If you are looking to gift a Nintendo Switch this holiday season, Walmart has one of the best deals right now, which includes &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-w-Neon-Blue-Neon-Red-Joy-Con-12-Month-Individual-Membership-Nintendo-Switch-Online-Carrying-Case%2F498089523&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the console, a carrying case, and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online (individual membership)&lt;/a&gt; for $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qibft2"&gt;It’s a unique deal for a few reasons: the Nintendo Switch alone costs $300, and 12 months of Nintendo’s online service costs $20. Carrying cases vary in price but can cost anywhere between $13 to $33. Nintendo Switch Online is a great service if you plan to purchase games that take advantage of the online feature like &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnimal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596439%2F720388718&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496590475%2F55432571&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592998%2F467273231&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;ongoing popularity&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo doesn’t discount the Switch console itself. The only way you’re going to save money when buying one is through bundles like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gf2eb0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10200007"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9iDVu1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You can get Super Mario Odyssey for free when you buy a Switch Pro controller","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/12/2/22016568/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-super-mario-odyssey-steelseries-arctis-pro-wireless-headset-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V4DvMI"&gt;The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the original version, which was released nearly four years ago, the updated Switch has two more hours of battery life. While playing the console in handheld mode, it can be used between 4.5 to nine hours on a single charge, depending on what games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ismdPA"&gt;With the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S kickstarting a new generation of consoles (and both being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult to find right now&lt;/a&gt;), the Switch still offers a lot of value as an eighth-generation console, thanks to its hybrid design of being both a home and handheld console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s best commercial features dogs frolicking in Halo, Minecraft, and Flight Simulator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EhpN7Kx26a6UrLDXQTyoU1vwZmY=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448606/dogsmicrosoftholiday2020.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kjcR6e"&gt;Microsoft has had some memorable holiday commercials over the years, but this year’s is the best yet because it features dogs. They aren’t just regular dogs, either. These pups dream of running around in a virtual &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;world, playing fetch with grenades for Master Chief in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and even flying high in the &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXx4Go"&gt;“A Dog’s Dream” features two dogs who are bored at home as their owners are distracted playing &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, busy on Microsoft Teams work calls, or crafting materials in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. One starts to dream about the possibilities if more dogs were part of video games or conference calls, and the rest is history. Just check out Master Chief’s reaction when one of the dogs fetches a grenade he just threw and returns it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wR8BZAs37gpA0wSGy06AJybfI2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141084/masterchief.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master Chief’s reaction is priceless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cJDhH5"&gt;Microsoft creates holiday commercials every year, but none have been as fun-filled as this one. Back in 2015, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/1/9827332/microsoft-holiday-tv-commercial-apple"&gt;hugged it out with Apple Store employees&lt;/a&gt; for some festive spirit, and then in 2017, it tried to make 3D Paint a thing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/10/16758462/microsoft-holiday-commercial-2017-3d-remix"&gt;adorable monsters&lt;/a&gt;. This year, it’s all about dogs frolicking in video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ny8mh5"&gt;Now we just need more dogs in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; for real to keep &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CanYouPetTheDog"&gt;@CanYouPetTheDog&lt;/a&gt; happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop is back down to its Black Friday price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nl8rMXR4epHbi5JgqJE1xCKa9tY=/0x0:1939x1293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448594/awhite_200319_3954_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zK25Nb"&gt;Some retailers are still shaking out a few remaining Cyber Monday deals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop. Though, there are some new ones, too. That busy shopping weekend was undoubtedly the best time to get gifts at the lowest prices, but that’s not to say you’ve completely run out of chances. The deals below prove otherwise, and as we get closer to the holidays, we’ll be surfacing more and more deals on tech products that might be on your wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QCdn8a"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jEiVNU"&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7aOoh6"&gt;The 14-inch Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop is a treat if you want a lot of power in a compact machine. Best Buy’s Black Friday deal is back, once again knocking $250 off the high-end configuration with AMD’s capable and efficient Ryzen 9 4900HS processor, Nvidia’s RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725507320874252995" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $1,200&lt;/a&gt;. And just so you know, this machine oddly doesn’t have a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="boDpW3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfvz7F"&gt;If getting to sleep — or if you’re a light sleeper, staying asleep — is a challenge, Lectrofan’s white noise machine might be helpful. This product has become indispensable to me, and it travels well, too.

    <title>Google Maps now lets you create Street View photos with just a phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oRExENHepnnLavE3wwtXKWpuKKE=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68447913/googlestreetviewnew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nVtjyX"&gt;Google Maps is getting a new update that lets you create Street View photos using just a phone. Android users with &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices"&gt;ARCore-compatible devices&lt;/a&gt; can now capture imagery and publish it to Google Street View in certain areas. Google is allowing submissions initially in Toronto, New York, Austin, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Costa Rica. More regions will support this feature soon, and Google will use this user-generated content when it doesn’t have its own Street View imagery available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0bVxw"&gt; “While our own Street View trekkers and cars have collected more than 170 billion images from 10 million miles around the planet, there are still many unmapped parts of the world,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/anyone-can-share-their-world-with-street-view/"&gt;says Stafford Marquardt&lt;/a&gt;, product manager of Google Maps Street View. “Where people contribute connected photos, they will appear in the Street View layer on Google Maps as dotted blue lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-lni3-wqZV9csDjuGFypzt8ozk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140929/streetviewgif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Street View feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlmvtv"&gt;The new beta feature has been in testing for months, and Google will automatically rotate and position the series of connected photos that are captured in its Street View app for Android. While users have been able to submit Street View imagery in the past, it required a special 360-degree camera. This new feature just makes use of a standard phone camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpeDrO"&gt;It opens up the Street View feature to many more areas, including hard to reach places that even Google’s Street View trekkers and cars haven’t visited. Google will also use this imagery to update Google Maps with information like new businesses or publicly posted open hours, and the company will apply its standard Street View privacy features to blur out faces and license plates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Royole returns with a better folding phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gTO_lySveZO7vK50rtkouFR3yDs=/48x0:561x342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68447874/DSCF74642.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The FlexPai 2 is a big improvement&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7k7Fme"&gt;Remember the first folding phone? No, not Samsung’s ill-fated original Galaxy Fold — the one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/5/18067116/royole-flexpai-flexible-display-foldable-smartphone-tablet-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;beat it to market&lt;/a&gt;. In hindsight, and honestly in foresight back then as well, Royole’s FlexPai was a hurried attention grab that existed solely to attain world-first status. But it’s not like it came out of nowhere; Royole had been set up several years earlier solely to develop flexible screen technology, so it’s understandable that the company would want to get ahead of Samsung to show off what it could do. A flex, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGko9G"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18174278/royole-flexpai-foldable-phone-android-ces-2019"&gt;the FlexPai was bad&lt;/a&gt;. But now there’s a FlexPai 2, and it’s surprisingly pretty good. I’ve been using a Chinese model for a while and can report that it’s a big improvement over the original, with some neat refinements to the design. Samsung won’t have much to worry about, but that’s not necessarily the goal here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbYyRO"&gt;Royole doesn’t just see itself as a consumer electronics company. It has partnerships with hundreds of brands that see it providing flexible display and sensor technology to the likes of AirBus, Toyota, and Louis Vuitton. A Royole representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is pleased with the FlexPai 2’s performance in China so far, but wouldn’t disclose sales data. At roughly $500 cheaper than Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 2, though, it’s worth a look however many units it sells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQXLfS"&gt;Royole also says it plans to announce global availability early next year. As such, this isn’t a full review of the FlexPai 2 — my review unit was loaded with Chinese-only software, so I can’t tell you much about the daily-driver experience. I can, however, tell you that the hardware is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7KeW_1f_7b2AzcZ52pPa01Bj_f8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140904/DSCF7461.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;When unfolded, the FlexPai 2 is roughly the size of an iPad mini.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4FfxbRpJOLuFoVf2Xx8wWFq-3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140905/DSCF7457.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2 runs Royole’s WaterOS Android 10 skin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ikAyN_D5h3HitC12hfZqqR_sKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140906/DSCF7465.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2 is about the size of a passport when folded.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bjUggI"&gt;The FlexPai 2 folds the opposite way to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold devices; that’s to say that the main screen goes around the outside of the curve rather than the inside, so it remains exposed when the hinge is closed. It’s the same approach seen in Huawei’s Mate X folding phones. When folded, the FlexPai 2 is about the same size and shape as a passport, while the unfolded screen is comparable to an iPad mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y72o3B"&gt;You really get three screens in one with the FlexPai 2, although you only use one at once. The display is a 7.8-inch 1920 x 1440 4:3 panel which turns into a 5.5-inch 1440 x 900 16:10 panel or a 5.4-inch 1440 x 810 16.9 panel when folded, depending on which half you’re looking at. The reason it doesn’t fold evenly is because there’s a large bezel on one side of the screen that houses the phone’s quad cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebkGsb"&gt;Build quality is solid, although a slightly thicker plastic gasket on the opposite side of the screen to the cameras betrays the need for a little more durability protection than on your average smartphone. The phone feels great when unfolded, though, with a 6.8mm-thick slimline metal frame, and the hinge is smooth and torquey, without the awkward rubber concertina of the original FlexPai. One advantage of Royole’s new design over Samsung’s is that it can be folded tight without leaving a gap between the two halves of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ol4DgmeOlkkDIh9RevGsPWXQqM4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140909/DSCF74642.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PnCZst"&gt;The disadvantage is apparent in the display. The OLED panel itself looks decent enough, with good contrast and brightness, and while the resolution isn’t class-leading it’s sharp enough at 308 ppi. The problem is that because the screen has a larger bend radius than the Galaxy Fold’s, which folds at an acute angle on the inside, more of that crease is visible when the phone is unfolded. Basically, the crease is much bigger. I don’t find it too distracting, as it’s only really visible when light catches it the wrong way. But you can definitely feel the hinge behind the screen whenever you swipe across the middle, which isn’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zEFfg"&gt;I can’t really speak to durability other than to say I haven’t seen any problems in my month-plus with the device. I asked Royole for details on its own ULT-NSSP material used in the “Cicada Wing” display, and a representative wouldn’t confirm whether it was plastic or glass, only saying it’s “composed of ~100 micro-nano materials.” They also said it’s “shatterproof and functional after close to two million folds,” which makes me think it’s plastic. It definitely feels like plastic. But so does Samsung’s “ultra-thin glass,” so. Just know that Royole is not yet the one to make folding screens feel premium to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaSaSC"&gt;The FlexPai 2 has high-end specs inside, with a Snapdragon 865 processor, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,450mAh battery. I found performance to be pretty good, with few of the software issues that plagued the original FlexPai whenever you wanted to switch up the orientation. As I mentioned before, I haven’t been able to use this as a primary device because of its onboard software, but Royole’s WaterOS does seem to have been improved quite a bit from the original FlexPai.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RntZ8-bUMhjFKrmUeCc87QGrAyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140907/DSCF7462.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The FlexPai 2’s hinge is much sleeker than the original’s.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TXO0Jb"&gt;At 9,998 yuan, or roughly $1,500, the FlexPai 2 is still not exactly cheap. And Royole’s status as a newcomer to the mobile industry is another good reason to view the device with suspicion. But my experience of the hardware has been fairly positive, and Royole’s screen technology may well find itself into phones from other companies at some point; ZTE has been touted as an early partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nr6yef"&gt;It’s still hard to recommend buying a folding phone from anyone, but Royole does deserve some credit for making a major improvement on its initial effort. The original FlexPai was a hasty attempt at notoriety, but its sequel feels like a much more credible device. If Royole can nail the software and maybe get the price down a little further for a Western release, it could be worth a look if you’re enamored with the form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RXcBJ7"&gt;One UI 3.0 has the messaging, notifications and security features of Android 11, along with some add-ons specific to One UI. Samsung has added easier ways to access widgets, take screenshots, and double-tap the screen to put your phone to sleep, to name a few, but if you want a more exhaustive list of all of the One UI 3.0 changes, you can check out this &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/17/heres-absolutely-every-new-thing-in-samsung-oneui-3-0/"&gt;roundup at &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="54sOyC"&gt;Outside the US, the international launch of One UI 3.0 also seems to be spinning up as well. &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; says that &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/02/samsung-shares-timeline-for-international-release-of-one-ui-3-0-for-galaxy-phones/"&gt;Samsung sent a full schedule of release dates&lt;/a&gt; to users in Egypt, with the flagship S20 line receiving Android 11 and One UI 3.0 some time in December, though after the US. According to the schedule, the next phones to receive the update will be the Note 20, Z Fold, Note 10, and S10 phones in January 2021. The update will take some time to hit every Samsung phone that supports it you’re using a Galaxy A10, A20 or A30S, don’t expect to see it before August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dvb3sE"&gt;When we reviewed Android 11 in September, we appreciated all its added features for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;managing the complexity of modern Android phones&lt;/a&gt;, but noted the possibility for fragmentation, as Google and Samsung’s takes on Android have started to diverge yet again. Samsung was known for taking a long time to release updates, like when it took five whole months to send out Android Pie. But that’s changed over the years as it’s gotten better at managing its timeline. Last year’s Android 10 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21025221/android-10-samsung-galaxy-s10-availability-att-sprint-t-mobile-verizon-xfinity-mobile-one-ui"&gt;took three months to hit the first phones&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s what we’re seeing with Android 11 this year too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeAGu7"&gt;Issues like fragmentation are important because Samsung is the largest smartphone vendor globally, and the largest producer of Android phones in the US. That means the widespread adoption of new features largely relies on the company choosing to include them in new versions of One UI. From our early preview, it seems like the most important bits of Android 11 have made it into One UI 3.0; but when it comes to Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;other Android projects&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung might not have as much to gain. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you’ve got an older iPhone, your FaceTime calls just got better </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dsj7Hh"&gt;When Apple released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21547652/ios-14-2-available-now-download-new-emoji-wallpaper-airplay-2-iphone-ipad-update"&gt;iOS 14.2 last month&lt;/a&gt;, it didn’t mention that FaceTime calls would now be in 1080p for older iPhones. &lt;a href="https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2020/12/01/iphones-8-e-mais-recentes-agora-suportam-facetime-hd-1080p/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;MacMagazine &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has updated the product &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone%2Fcompare%2F%3Fdevice1%3Diphone8%26device2%3DiphoneXR%26device3%3Diphone11pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149428%2Fiphone-facetime-1080p-facetime-hd-iphone8-ios-14-2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comparison pages&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhones 8, X, XR, XS, SE, and 11 (including the Max and Pro versions) to show that they now support FaceTime at 1080p over Wi-Fi, as opposed to before when they only supported 720p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5O5KJ"&gt;Calls made over cellular will still be at the lower resolution, but if you’re FaceTiming over Wi-Fi you may notice increased clarity after the update. That is, unless both callers had the iPhone 12, which has had 1080p FaceTime calls from the start (including over cellular if you’re on 5G). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9InA3"&gt;My sister has an iPhone 8 with the update, so I called her up on FaceTime. I had her take a screenshot when we were calling over Wi-Fi, then had her switch to cellular and take another screenshot for comparison. For good measure, I also took screenshots on my iPhone 12 Mini to compare what it looked like on my end. You can judge for yourself if you can notice any differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AWS275"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10199176"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kUiwK2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10199183"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrJaS"&gt;I’ve worked in video all my life, and the difference between the two is pretty striking to me, at least on her end. On my end the difference is a little noticeable, but I don’t think I’d be able to tell at a glance if the video coming from her phone was in full HD. Part of this could be that, while her phone is streaming to me at an increased resolution, the iPhone 8 still has the 7MP FaceTime camera, as opposed to the 12MP camera found on the iPhone 11 and later. Of course, whether you see a difference depends on how sensitive you are to changes in video quality, or how good your eyesight is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the iOS 14.2 changelog that shows up when updating a phone" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2GL0rhRfMmcNFTpgl2vweiGfEcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140202/changelog.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iOS 14.2 changelog, with no mention of the FaceTime improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2DvHSq"&gt;It’s unclear why Apple didn’t include this feature in the changelog for the update, given that it’s on the iPhone &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-se%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149428%2Fiphone-facetime-1080p-facetime-hd-iphone8-ios-14-2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;product&lt;/a&gt; and comparison pages. Nevertheless, it’s a nice bonus given that a lot of people will be celebrating the holidays over video call in order to stay safe. Mom and dad will be able to see the kids’ smiles a little better, and when you can’t be together you might be surprised at the difference a seemingly small jump in clarity can make. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now record footage from Ecobee’s camera to Apple servers, but you may want to keep their app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ecobee SmartCamera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Ip-buSprBFVdkoxGqRpyQlyWKI=/360x0:2520x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68446137/ecobee_SmartCamera_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A23RvO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/newsroom/press-releases/ecobee-reaffirms-commitment-to-open-ecosystem-with-homekit-secure-video/"&gt;Ecobee’s SmartCamera has received a firmware update &lt;/a&gt;that may interest Apple users who are feeling a little burnt-out on subscriptions. The camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;which doubled as an Alexa speaker when it launched this April&lt;/a&gt;, generally has the standard smart camera features: you can stream video from it to your phone for free, and with a $5-a-month subscription you can have it record video and notify you of any movement (or just human movement, if you prefer). But today’s update adds Apple HomeKit Secure Video support, and it may give you another, cheaper way to record and store that footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QveM5I"&gt;If you’re a little unfamiliar with the service, you’re probably not alone. HomeKit Secure Video was launched at WWDC in June of 2019, but so far &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-camera&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149216%2Fecobee-smart-camera-apple-homekit-support-firmware-update-subscription#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only a handful of cameras&lt;/a&gt; support it. Like Ecobee’s service, it lets you stream video to your iOS devices for free, provided you have an Apple TV, HomePod, or stay-at-home iPad that can act as a HomeKit hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOsZTy"&gt;If you want to record video, you’ll need to pay for Apple’s 200GB iCloud subscription, which costs $2.99 a month. But that’s cheaper than Ecobee’s service, and also includes extra space for your iCloud backups, Apple Photo Library, etc. You won’t have to worry about all that recorded footage eating up your iCloud storage. As a HomeKit Secure Video user myself, I can tell you that Apple doesn’t count the video towards your storage limit (though the service only keeps recorded clips for 10 days, as opposed to Ecobee’s 14 days). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyGsiv"&gt;If you already have a device that can act as a hub, $2.99 a month versus $5 a month may seem like a good deal, and if you already pay for extra iCloud storage the service is included in your bill. It’s a bit of a harder sell  if you also have to buy an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad, though. If you want to record more than one camera, you’ll also see less savings: Apple requires the $9.99-a-month 2TB iCloud storage plan to record up to 5 cameras (Ecobee or otherwise), which is the same price you’ll pay for unlimited recording on multiple Ecobee cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwRyq7"&gt;Before deciding to switch to HomeKit and ditch the Ecobee app, you should know that Ecobee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple’s Home app doesn’t support the camera’s ability to pan and tilt (other HomeKit cameras have the same limitation, too). You might want to keep the Ecobee app around for that, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fcameras%2Fcircle-view-security-camera.961-000489.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22149216%2Fecobee-smart-camera-apple-homekit-support-firmware-update-subscription#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;or buy a cheaper HomeKit camera to begin with&lt;/a&gt;. I personally use Homekit Secure Video to manage my Logitech Circle 2, and it works well for its primary purpose: not having to pay an extra monthly fee to see what terrible disaster my cat has caused during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A night-vision image of a cat sitting on a piece of furniture with its eyes glowing and mouth open" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s51x83WIq2ybzwIdlZMwA_DuNNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22139878/IMG_0404.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lovely. Thank you, HomeKit Secure Video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
