    <title>Microsoft’s Clipchamp acquisition will help improve video editing on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8yDsfxmE-NdaFYxuQTDRYDfSwQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828694/DSCF1179.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YJmpiW"&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Clipchamp, a browser-based video editing tool, and is hinting that it will be a great fit for Windows. Founded in 2013, Clipchamp lets people create and edit videos in a browser and utilize the full power of a GPU to render the final result. Clipchamp is used by companies like Google, Dell, and Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITTcEM"&gt;Microsoft is now looking to integrate Clipchamp into its Microsoft 365 offerings, and perhaps even Windows itself. “As a web app that uses the full power of your PC, Clipchamp is a natural fit to extend the cloud-powered productivity experiences in Microsoft 365 for individuals, families, schools, and businesses,” explains Chris Pratley, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Office media group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uNPpTY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft says Clipchamp is a great fit for Windows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyeBWb"&gt;Interestingly, Pratley also says “it’s a great fit for Microsoft Windows,” which suggests that Microsoft could integrate Clipchamp into Windows in the future. Clipchamp already exists as an app in the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft’s existing video editing tools for Windows are lackluster to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJLCPg"&gt;Windows 11 may improve that situation, alongside the potential Clipchamp integration in the future. Windows and devices chief Panos Panay teased a new photos app for Windows 11 just minutes before the acquisition announcement, with what looks like better tools for editing photos and videos. The existing photos app in Windows 10 can edit videos, but the tools are very basic, and aren’t even close to the level of editing options available in Clipchamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q3ZCHu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pumped to share another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Windows11&lt;/a&gt; first look with you - the beautifully redesigned &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PhotosApp?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PhotosApp&lt;/a&gt; is coming soon to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsInsiders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsInsiders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hraNJAo9iF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hraNJAo9iF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Panos Panay (@panos_panay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1435346853365575680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1DNpyw"&gt;Clipchamp uses a combination of templates and a library of filters, transitions, stock media, and styles to let people created videos with multi-track audio support and user-friendly editing. Microsoft’s acquisition appears to be part of the company’s renewed focus on creation, and even consumer-friendly apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D58J3Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628689/microsoft-manik-gupta-hire-uber-consumer-teams-skype-groupme"&gt;Microsoft recently hired a former Uber exec&lt;/a&gt; to lead a consumer apps effort inside the company, months after CEO Satya Nadella said “the next 10 years is going to be as much about creation as it is about consumption and about the community around it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is coming to parts of Europe on October 26th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucq85RArGZ_Ny_0GTi27GfW9Dhw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828669/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oPcrax"&gt;HBO Max will launch in Europe next month on October 26th, the streaming service announced today. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Spain, and Andorra are the first six countries it’ll be available in, before it expands to the following 14 territories next year: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2khb8v"&gt;The list of territories corresponds to the regions currently covered by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO_Europe"&gt;HBO Europe&lt;/a&gt;, which operates a handful of different streaming services on the continent including HBO España, HBO Nordic, and HBO Go. The company has previously said it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;transition its European HBO-branded services&lt;/a&gt; to HBO Max over the course of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="16o7Zx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Larger markets like the UK, Italy, France, and Germany are absent from the list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CDXPKP"&gt;Notably absent from the list are larger markets like the UK, Italy, France, and Germany. HBO has historically not operated standalone services in these countries, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-europe-rollout-plan-nordics-spain-1235005773/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, but has instead opted to license its content to local operators like Comcast-owned Sky in the UK. HBO says that “additional territory launches are also planned for next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsRuRe"&gt;“WarnerMedia movies and series like &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; are passionately consumed by fans all across Europe,” said Head of HBO Max International Johannes Larcher. “HBO Max has been created to provide them with the most intuitive and convenient viewing experience to watch these and a diverse range of other amazing titles.” HBO Max currently includes content from Warner Bros., HBO, DC, and Cartoon Network, as well as new content branded as Max Originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pu0ZYB"&gt;HBO Max debuted in the US in May last year. In June, the streaming service launched across &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/6/29/22556006/hbo-max-launches-in-39-international-markets-outside-us"&gt;39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9jRih"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t mention how much European customers can expect to pay for the streaming service. Instead, that information will be announced in a virtual launch event planned for next month, HBO says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo is rebooting its Chromebook Duet with a 13.3-inch OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user sits in pajamas on a bed with a bright window in the background, using the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 in tablet mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRNXA78KOAj9mY2C6dz_kSEUdSY=/320x0:3770x2300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828394/Lenovo_Chromebook_Duet_5_Storm_Grey_relax.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Chromebook Duet 5 in “storm grey.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DteUJf"&gt;Over a year after it was unveiled, Lenovo’s category-defining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; is getting a sequel. The Chromebook Duet 5 (branded as the IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook outside of North America) is a head-to-toe reimagining of the detachable budget-oriented Duet, with a higher price, a new processor, and — most interestingly — a 13.3-inch OLED screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qctM3H"&gt;Lenovo says the Duet 5 is likely the first of multiple additions to the Duet line, in an ambitious effort to bring the detachable form factor to multiple price points. The company will continue selling the 10.1-inch Duet (for the time being). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vQQDdJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 2-in-1 Chrome OS tablet with a detachable keyboard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXxFil"&gt;The new OLED display covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, Lenovo says, and will emit “70 percent less blue light” than an LCD panel would, with the goal of delivering “incredible entertainment experiences.” OLED has long been a luxury signifier in the PC space, and with a starting price of $429.99, the Duet 5 will undoubtedly be one of the most affordable laptops ever to feature this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX5q1l"&gt;This Chromebook is part of a wave of thin and light OLED laptops recently unveiled across the industry. Lenovo has also added Windows-powered OLED models to its IdeaPad line, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652549/asus-proart-studiobook-16-pro-oled-vivobook-expertbook"&gt;Asus has outfitted&lt;/a&gt; a number of its consumer and enterprise lines (including its budget-oriented VivoBook and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652934/asus-zenbook-14x-oled-laptop-ultraportable-notebook-samsung-screen-display"&gt;ultraportable ZenBook&lt;/a&gt;) with the technology. The OLED craze isn’t out of thin air; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;Samsung (the world’s largest OLED vendor) announced in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would begin mass-producing laptop-sized 90Hz OLED screens this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Chromebook Duet in laptop mode, seen from above on a white background with the stylus perpendicular to the right side of the panel. The screen displays the Chrome OS launcher." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bsHeB8Fwa0lK3TV6mUIxCpWx_qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831666/Lenovo_Chromebook_Duet_5_Abyss_Blue_Slim_Light.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is in “abyss blue.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zo7M2A"&gt;The Chromebook Duet 5 will be powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 compute platform&lt;/a&gt;, announced in May. This chip is designed for entry-level laptops and recently appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22466164/samsung-galaxy-book-go-laptop-windows-arm-snapdragon-price-specs"&gt;Samsung’s $349 Galaxy Book Go&lt;/a&gt;. Reviewers have found &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-book-go-review/#GalaxyBookGoPerf"&gt;that to be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Book-Go-in-review-Silent-office-notebook.555454.0.html"&gt;a bit slow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-book-go"&gt;so far&lt;/a&gt;, but Chrome OS is less demanding to run than Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJ6vZe"&gt;The detachable form factor, most popularly associated with Microsoft’s Surface Pro devices, has appeared on a variety of laptop lines this year. Asus now sells the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;, a direct (albeit more expensive) competitor to the Duet with a built-in stylus garage and a kickstand that folds both vertically and horizontally. On the very opposite end of the price spectrum is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620111/hp-elite-folio-2021-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;HP’s $1,629 Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt;, also powered by a Snapdragon processor (but running Windows and covered in leather). Earlier this year, Lenovo tried the form factor in an X-Series ThinkPad with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;X12 Detachable&lt;/a&gt;, packing a beefier Intel Core i5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lq9i3P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Chromebook Duet 5 will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 compute platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObQGl4"&gt;Still, much of what made the original Duet such an attractive purchase was the combination of its low price, portability, and outstanding battery life. (We got well over 11 hours of continuous work in our testing.) The Duet 5 is heavier than the smaller Duet and significantly more expensive. (The predecessor starts at $279.) The Duet 5 has a different processor from the Duet and a screen that’s traditionally more power-hungry, so battery life is a question mark. (Lenovo’s most recent attempt at an OLED detachable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;, had some... problems in that area.) A 13.3-inch OLED screen is certainly a neat prospect, but whether it’s a good value will be another story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOBkDS"&gt;The Chromebook Duet 5 is expected to be available in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon is the lightest 14-inch laptop with an OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user sits on a couch in sweatpants and a flannel, seen from the side, typing on an IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M6mpzYnoKGTuic8I4RE34xM7BKY=/390x0:4611x2814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69828391/Lenovo_IdeaPad_Slim_7_Carbon_AMD_14in_stilllife.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typing away on the IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Y6zv1"&gt;Joining an army of OLED laptops that have launched this month is Lenovo’s new IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon (branded as the Yoga Slim 7 Carbon outside of North America). Lenovo claims it’s the lightest 14-inch OLED laptop on the market at 2.37 pounds. (I’m guessing the company is right. The closest competitor I can think of is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652934/asus-zenbook-14x-oled-laptop-ultraportable-notebook-samsung-screen-display"&gt;Asus’ ZenBook 14X OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which is 3.09 pounds. It’s also lighter than both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbZVAN"&gt;One thing to note is that the OLED panel (from Samsung Display) comes with QHD+ resolution, rather than the 4K resolution that you often see on OLED laptops. This means you won’t get as many pixels as you would on a 4K OLED machine (like the ZenBook 14X), but you may also see better battery life. QHD+ is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529429/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-performance-features"&gt;still plenty sharp&lt;/a&gt;, especially at this size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uljNqU"&gt;There are other things to like about the display, too. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which will afford more vertical space than the 16:9 panel on last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21423498/lenovo-ideapad-slim-7-2020-amd-review"&gt;IdeaPad Slim 7&lt;/a&gt;. Lenovo says it has a 90Hz refresh rate (a hallmark that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;Samsung promised&lt;/a&gt; would appear on more OLED laptops this year), will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and will reach 600 nits of brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The IdeaPad Slim 7 Carbon open on a white background, facing left. The screen displays two windowed apps on a black and purple background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mNUoelQg-YfHrMTmHA3N8OWdzk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832700/Lenovo_IdeaPad_Slim_7_Carbon_AMD_14in_Front_Facing_Left.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made from carbon fiber and magnesium alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VmNJ3F"&gt;Inside, the Slim 7 can be configured with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 5800U, an Nvidia GeForce MX450 graphics card, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of storage. There’s a 61Whr battery that Lenovo claims will last up to 14.5 hours — which may seem like a tall order, but we got close to that out of last year’s Slim 7, which had a slightly smaller battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYdRz3"&gt;Lenovo also insists the thing is durable, despite its light build. Per the company, the device has undergone “nine operational tests” for durability, and can withstand “everyday physical shock and harsh environmental conditions.” It’s expected to hit shelves in October with a starting price of $1,289.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard of the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 Pro seen from above on a white background. The screen displays a few windowed apps on an orange background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3UljSnaFO8DXSCr5gSiCNO3_020=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832517/IdeaPad__Slim_7_Pro_Storm_Grey_Hero_Keyboard.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Yoga Slim 7 Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PcOVLQ"&gt;Lenovo also showed off a new Yoga Slim 7 Pro (branded as the IdeaPad Slim 7 Pro outside North America — I know, it’s confusing). This is a 16-inch laptop with a regular IPS touchscreen rather than an OLED, though it’s also 16:10 and has QHD resolution. That screen goes up to 120Hz, an even bigger boon for the gaming crowd. Models come with up to a Ryzen 7 5800H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. There’s a 75Whr battery. The Slim 7 Pro is expected in October with a starting price of $1,449. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pY246y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDiYBL"&gt;Twitter has begun testing the first of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654061/twitter-features-archive-old-tweets-hide-likes-remove-followers-plans"&gt;proposed suite of new privacy tools&lt;/a&gt;: the ability to remove a follower without blocking them. The remove follower feature is currently being tested on the web and seems to canonize the “soft block” concept as an official Twitter tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niIQoB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435323978734841857?s=20"&gt;According to the tweet announcing the test&lt;/a&gt;, you can remove followers from the follower list on your profile page. You just click the three-dot menu next to a follower’s name, click “Remove follower,” and your tweets will no longer automatically show up in their timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUV-giTqpT4jbY42l3zMge5GH7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832668/followerRemoval2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remove follower option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6A7e47"&gt;This is different than &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/blocking-and-unblocking-accounts"&gt;blocking someone&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps them from viewing your tweets and direct messaging you (and keeps you from doing the same with them). Twitter’s new remove follower feature is more of a remote unfollow button, a gentler way to create some distance between you and someone else on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PmTm2"&gt;Previously, to have someone unfollow you without their knowledge, you could do a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-soft-block-on-twitter#:~:text=To%20soft%20block%20someone%2C%20you,t%20appear%20to%20be%20blocked."&gt;“soft block,”&lt;/a&gt; which is when you manually blocked and unblocked someone. Followers you remove then have to refollow you to see your tweets on their timeline, and if you have &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/safety-and-security/public-and-protected-tweets"&gt;protected tweets&lt;/a&gt; (aka private tweets, only viewable by your followers), they’d need your approval to become a follower again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjSnpr"&gt;Testing similar functionality as an official Twitter feature is an admission that it could probably be easier and that people could benefit from it. It’s also yet another case of Twitter making the habits of its users official features, just like &lt;a href="https://qz.com/135149/the-first-ever-hashtag-reply-and-retweet-as-twitter-users-invented-them/"&gt;the @reply, hashtag, and retweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JogUDV"&gt;An even better solution might be more granular control over who can see your tweets at the point of tweet conception — Twitter is considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558731/twitter-trusted-friends-facets-features-pre-announce"&gt;an Instagram-like “Close Friends” option&lt;/a&gt; — but for now, easily and quietly pruning your follower list will have to do. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tripwire CEO out 53 hours after tweeting his opinions on Texas abortion law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NTKkQceU4M8irOIk5IpDyGMvPL4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69827424/d70494e0_963b_11ea_b479_2d2989941d85_ManeaterLaunchScreen2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tripwire Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="giAsa9"&gt;John Gibson, CEO of Tripwire Interactive — the studio known for making horror games like &lt;em&gt;Killing Floor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/5/22/21266348/maneater-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maneater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — was made to step down a blisteringly quick 53 hours after he tweeted in favor of the controversial Texas abortion law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFswgk"&gt;In the tweet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RammJaeger/status/1434245886670901250"&gt;Gibson says&lt;/a&gt;, “Proud of&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USSupremeCourt?src=hashtag_click"&gt; #USSupremeCourt&lt;/a&gt; affirming the Texas law banning abortion for babies with a heartbeat. As an entertainer I don’t get political often. Yet with so many vocal peers on the other side of this issue, I felt it was important to go on the record as a pro-life game developer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCABeB"&gt;The tweet drew sharp criticisms from across the gaming industry with many consumers stating they would no longer buy Tripwire games and sharing how to block the developer from showing up in Steam recommendations. Detractors also noted that Gibson’s pro-life opinion wasn’t the problem but that he chose to voice it publicly in his capacity as a CEO and in support of a law that essentially offers $10,000 bounties on abortion seekers and the people who help them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zF4Tn"&gt;The Texas law, known as &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961"&gt;SB 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/health/texas-abortion-law-facts.html"&gt;bans abortion&lt;/a&gt; when a “fetal heartbeat” is detected. While the term “fetal heartbeat” is not medical in nature, the phrasing of the law effectively bans abortion around six weeks into the pregnancy, which can be before a person even knows they are pregnant. A critical component of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033202132/texas-abortion-ban-what-happens-next"&gt;law deputizes private citizens&lt;/a&gt;, not the state, to enforce it, granting people the ability to sue abortion providers and anyone accused of abetting abortion seekers. For any person who wins such a suit, they can be awarded $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yob66U"&gt;Gibson tweeted his support for the law on September 4th. The next day, Shipwright Studios, a co-development services studio, tweeted that they would be canceling any contracts they had with Tripwire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eaOMS"&gt;“We cannot in good conscience continue to work with Tripwire under the current leadership structure,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shipwrightstdio/status/1434609166560202754"&gt;Shipwright Studios wrote&lt;/a&gt; a mere 24 hours after Gibson’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHJBni"&gt;By September 6th, Tripwire announced that Gibson would be stepping down as CEO, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8toNo"&gt;“His comments disregarded the values of our whole team, our partners and much of our broader community,” &lt;a href="https://www.tripwireinteractive.com/#/news/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-alan-wilson"&gt;Tripwire wrote on their website&lt;/a&gt;. “Our leadership team at Tripwire are deeply sorry and are unified in our commitment to take swift action and to foster a more positive environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUuYSN"&gt;Alan Wilson will replace Gibson as interim CEO. It is unknown if Gibson will continue to be employed by Tripwire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV1UQc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UclEP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s monthly prices increase by $1 as Disney pushes its streaming bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZvQWmAPZBSWRc8YBsvUH4Hguwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69827049/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yI15ID"&gt;Hulu’s streaming plans cost $1 more starting on October 8th, with its ad-supported tier going up to $6.99 each month and its ad-free tier going up to $12.99 monthly. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hulu-price-increase-streaming-plans-1235057717/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the price of Hulu’s live TV service, which also includes access to its streaming content, isn’t increasing. Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117502/hulu-ceo-randy-freer-disney-plus-kevin-mayer-dtc-espn-marvel-studios"&gt;the majority owner of Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, has increased the prices of its other streaming services over the past year, making its bundle that includes all of them look more and more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zLgZe"&gt;The price of the Disney bundle, which includes Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus, doesn’t appear to be going up along with Hulu’s prices — however, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;already went up by a dollar&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;Disney Plus got a $1 per month price hike&lt;/a&gt;. It currently costs $13.99 per month for a version with ad-supported Hulu and $19.99 a month for ad-free Hulu. If you want all the services, the bundle is a good deal — it’ll save you almost $8 a month versus buying the services separately (after the Hulu price change) whether you go with the ad or ad-free plans. Disney’s CEO &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hulu-price-increase-streaming-plans-1235057717/"&gt;has reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; that the company is pushing the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Hulu’s website reading: Upcoming price increase. Hulu (no ads)’s price will increase from $11.99/mo to $12.99/mo on 10/08/2021.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen Hulu subscribers are shown when logging in. Subscribers have also been sent emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5e5M8j"&gt;For those who had existing Hulu subscriptions before signing up to the Disney Bundle, billing is handled by &lt;a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&amp;amp;sys_kb_id=fe020c3edbb12c1032f7c28d13961906#i"&gt;charging the regular price for Hulu&lt;/a&gt; then giving the user a discount on their Disney Plus subscription. Hulu’s support Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824"&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the price of the Disney Bundle will not change due to the price increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UoSK4t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey there, Justin! No — the Disney Bundle and Live TV plan prices will not change as a result of the above price changes. Let us know if you have any other questions!&lt;/p&gt;— Hulu Support (@hulu_support) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTpEzc"&gt;Hulu hasn’t been resting on its laurels since its last price increase, though. In recent months, subscribers have gotten access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639273/hulu-hdr-original-shows-movies-4k-picture-quality"&gt;HDR for some original shows and movies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;a Watch Party feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets friends watch shows together. Whether these features and the content available on the service add up to something worth $7 or $13 a month will be up to you, but come October, that’s the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter tests a new timeline with edge-to-edge picture and video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTYgC7iqA7Mh4QXf7S9KReQLDLA=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826841/pasted_image_0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Fb6Ju"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435287486411022337?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s testing edge-to-edge media in tweets on iOS, creating a more full-screen, almost Instagram-like experience for the photos and videos in your timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TtXp3"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter writes that it’s testing the change because it wants to better support conversations that are both visual and text-based. You can get a sense of what that looks like in a video posted to Twitter’s support account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YwKkUT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now testing on iOS:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edge to edge Tweets that span the width of the timeline so your photos, GIFs, and videos can have more room to shine. &lt;a href="https://t.co/luAHoPjjlY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/luAHoPjjlY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435287486411022337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XQBidj"&gt;This change, if it rolls out beyond a select group of iOS users, also helps Twitter address concerns over image cropping that it’s been dealing with over the last few years. Image cropping algorithms have been informally shown to have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;bias toward white faces&lt;/a&gt;, something Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617972/twitter-photo-cropping-algorithm-ai-bias-bug-bounty-results"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Twitter has attempted to address that problem by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;eliminating photo cropping&lt;/a&gt;, but this design test takes things a step further with an Instagram-style emphasis on visuals. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;Entire joke formats get lost in the process&lt;/a&gt;, but such is the cost of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Etpe4B"&gt;Naturally, some people have already taken issue with Twitter’s design. Searches for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22New%20Twitter%22&amp;amp;src=trend_click&amp;amp;f=live&amp;amp;vertical=trends"&gt;“New Twitter”&lt;/a&gt; bring up plenty of complaints, like that the new layout &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gibbsgirl00/status/1435311605005406212?s=20"&gt;is headache-inducing&lt;/a&gt; and that edge-to-edge screenshots of tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sambruho/status/1435311573732577281?s=20"&gt;can confusingly look like an actual tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, Twitter might have some more tweaking to do before this test becomes something official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xbhjgk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter is changing the contrast of buttons again after complaints of eye strain ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623717/twitter-buttons-contrast-design-changes-eye-strain"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple’s car chief is heading to Ford</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hUYMbv4AhDt5Klk1Gx5stqaVTc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826815/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Exti0B"&gt;Ford has hired away Apple’s car chief, Doug Field, to become its chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer. “Field will lead Ford’s efforts to develop the next-gen Blue Oval Intelligence tech stack to deliver smart, connected vehicles and services that improve over time through constant updates,” &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/09/07/doug-field.html"&gt;according to Ford’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. He’ll report to Ford’s president and CEO, Jim Farley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVwOTp"&gt;Field was a VP of special projects at Apple, where he was the de facto head of the company’s confused efforts to make an autonomous electric car — known as Project Titan. He had a previous stint at Apple where he was once the VP of Mac hardware engineering, but he left the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/25/5027970/doug-field-leaves-apple-mac-hardware-engineering-for-tesla-motors"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; to become Tesla’s chief vehicle engineer, where he helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17528484/tesla-doug-field-model-3-production-elon-musk"&gt;oversee troublesome development of the Model 3 sedan&lt;/a&gt;. He left Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17528484/tesla-doug-field-model-3-production-elon-musk"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17673712/doug-field-apple-tesla-project-titan"&gt;rejoined Apple&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K7uoWw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The departure is the latest shake-up for Apple’s car division&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xBWRX"&gt;The departure is the latest shake-up for Apple’s car division, which has undergone numerous shifts over the past several years. Despite starting the project in 2014, work on an autonomous electric vehicle is still in an early stage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported in January&lt;/a&gt;. That approach is a change from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;earlier plan&lt;/a&gt; to develop self-driving software that would be utilized by other carmakers — which itself was a change from trying to build a car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HaDcw"&gt;“We’re grateful for the contributions Doug has made to Apple and we wish him all the best in this next chapter,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QSvFb"&gt;It’s unclear who will take Field’s place, though in June, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;hired Ulrich Kranz&lt;/a&gt;, a former BMW executive who worked on the i3 EV and i8 hybrid sports car, to work under Field. Kranz had recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;stepped down as CEO of Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, an EV startup he co-founded that Apple was interested in acquiring in 2020, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;exclusively reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s car efforts were reportedly moved under the purview of John Giannandrea, the company’s SVP of machine learning and AI, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIIY6R"&gt;Field joins Ford as the company has steadily been building out its electric vehicle efforts, most notably with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning, an all-electric version&lt;/a&gt; of the hugely popular pickup truck, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;as well as an all-electric Mustang&lt;/a&gt;. The company is rallying behind a business plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;it calls Ford Plus&lt;/a&gt; and intends to create more cars that are fully networked and can be updated over the air, like Teslas. Ford has also said that Google’s Android will power infotainment systems in “millions” of its cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;starting in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG claims its ‘Real Folding Window’ beats folding glass, will ship in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1u4QfWnyjomjhiJqSwTaxDhj11w=/16x0:835x546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826689/lg_chem_folding_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sY01G8"&gt;Bendable glass was supposed to unlock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;a future straight out of science fiction&lt;/a&gt;: phones that fold. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;the actual glass we got&lt;/a&gt; wound up relying on factory-installed plastic screen protectors to avoid shattering when you fold it. Now, LG wants to cut out the middleman by improving the plastic instead: the company &lt;a href="https://www.lgchem.com/company/information-center/press-release/news-detail-8713?lang=en_GLOBAL"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its “Real Folding Window,” a cover material it claims will be as hard as glass but without the whole cracking issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ms8LSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More PET, less glass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GWUE2"&gt;What’s the secret? Well, LG doesn’t quite say in its press release, only that it’s a “new material” that it uses to coat both sides of a sheet of plastic film — PET film, to be precise. (PET is probably best known as the plastic in your soda bottle.) The idea is that if you apply that coating to the plastic and then apply that cover material to a flexible OLED panel, you’ll have a folding screen that lasts longer and with a less noticeable crease than today’s folding devices. LG says it should be more competitive on price, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8m2GD"&gt;In fact, LG says the coated PET should work with tablets, laptops, and rollable-screen phones, too, like the one we’re still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;waiting for LG to decide whether it will cancel&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it sees potential for devices where the screen folds &lt;em&gt;outward&lt;/em&gt;, not just inward like we’ve seen with Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Moto Razr&lt;/a&gt;. LG also says it sees “significant improvements to the fold lines that occur on the folding parts of the screen.” Maybe it could unlock a lot more of the wacky folding phone designs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;we’ve seen in prototypes and patent applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vqLyt3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A field guide to the wacky future of foldable phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"},{"title":"Folding phones are the stuff of science fiction","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DczbVu"&gt;LG’s current timeline doesn’t see it commercializing this tech until 2023, though, and it’s not clear how it’ll actually stack up to glass in other ways (like clarity) when it arrives. Samsung’s on the PET train, too; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;as we’ve written&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 cover their ultra-thin glass (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) with a “Stretchable PET” layer that we found far superior to the gummy screen protector Samsung had to ship on prior models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGplI1"&gt;Samsung is reportedly ramping up production of folding screens for other phone makers as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;including Google&lt;/a&gt;. And it has been reportedly &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2077"&gt;working with Corning&lt;/a&gt;, which has been building its own folding glass to compete with Schott. Having even more competition from LG is a good thing if you’re a gadget lover hoping foldable prices will come down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qszr7b"&gt;Even without the additional suppliers, Samsung is already pushing folders hard: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;we called Samsung’s $1,000 Galaxy Z Flip 3 “the first folding phone for normal people”&lt;/a&gt; and thought the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; was “nearly normal” as well. &lt;/p&gt;
