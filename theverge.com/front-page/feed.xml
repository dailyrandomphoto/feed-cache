    <title>Lucasfilm hires the YouTube deepfaker who put its Luke, Leia and Tarkin cameos to shame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FZnTI1GXA_sXSQTo_QhyInx9WA=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636485/wrHXA2cSpNU_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AUoS5e"&gt;I recently re-watched &lt;em&gt;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. &lt;/em&gt;It mostly held up — except for Lucasfilm’s attempt to bring Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia and Peter Cushing’s Grand Moff Tarkin back to the big screen using CGI. That’s something that only bugged me the tiniest bit the first time I watched it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g43C1t"&gt;But Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light and Magic may now have the ability to make those movies a tad more futureproof, because it’s hired a YouTuber who specializes in deepfaking Star Wars and other big-budget movies, showing up their CGI de-aging techniques. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Shamook/videos"&gt;Shamook&lt;/a&gt; is the one who “fixed” Luke Skywalker’s cameo in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrHXA2cSpNU"&gt;to the tune of 1.9 million videos&lt;/a&gt;, and the improvements to &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;’s Tarkin are phenomenal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YZ6RMx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_CXMb_MO3aw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xWqkbq"&gt;Peter Cushing was certainly thin in the role, but he no longer looks quite so emaciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUBpVI"&gt;Instead of ordering YouTube to yank the content or sending cease-and-desists, &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/07/lucasfilm-hires-deepfake-youtuber-mandalorian-skywalker-vfx-1234653720/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IndieWire&lt;/em&gt; now reports&lt;/a&gt; Lucasfilm decided to hire Shamook instead to do what they apparently love. “[Industrial Light and Magic is] always on the lookout for talented artists and have in fact hired the artist that goes by the online persona ‘Shamook,’” a Lucasfilm representative told &lt;em&gt;IndieWire (&lt;/em&gt;via&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/lucasfilm-hires-deepfake-youtuber-who-fixed-the-mandalorian/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; “Over the past several years ILM has been investing in both machine learning and A.I. as a means to produce compelling visual effects work and it’s been terrific to see momentum building in this space as the technology advances.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnZSta"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmuYz0aZGgU&amp;amp;lc=UgwIZs7NpWc0EdjFK_x4AaABAg.9PVaOaYLW4Q9PVxN9E78kp"&gt;In the YouTube comments&lt;/a&gt; on a recent video, Shamook says their new title is “Senior Facial Capture Artist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbWkQX"&gt;I’m not sure Shamook’s results are always better than the originals; many still have that uncanny, mask-like quality that’s still common to a lot of deepfakes today, and they don’t have the benefit of all the additional CG lighting work that clearly went into Disney’s modern films and shows. But perhaps by combining ideas, they can reach new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyQZDt"&gt;Shamook also has a penchant for swapping stars, famously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC3uH4Xw4Xo"&gt;inserting Harrison Ford into &lt;em&gt;Solo: A Star Wars Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYXVvz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dml9Ev"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmQNeQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVYHmF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 14.7.1 to fix Apple Watch unlocking and a zero-day exploit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfFs8B_cRUHExgR7l5FZtQuuAbs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636290/DSC02729_dbohn_verge.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="60Z4kK"&gt;Last week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583871/apple-ios-14-7-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-ipad-timers-apple-card"&gt;iOS 14.7&lt;/a&gt; appeared, adding features including support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;magnetic battery pack&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212615"&gt;the update also interrupted&lt;/a&gt; the “Unlock with iPhone” feature that Apple Watch wearers used for easy access to their wristwear. Now, another update is going out to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hANNgW"&gt;However, even if you don’t have an Apple Watch, you should still install iOS 14.7.1 (and for Mac owners, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212622"&gt;macOS 11.5.1&lt;/a&gt;) as soon as you can, because &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212623"&gt;security notes&lt;/a&gt; from Apple reveal that the two updates it pushed today fix flaws that are already being exploited in the wild. The memory corruption issues in Apple’s desktop and mobile operating systems have been assigned the same vulnerability ID and attributed to an anonymous researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="umn7rg"&gt;IOMobileFrameBuffer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBbHJd"&gt;Available for: iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaZwfg"&gt;Available for: macOS Big Sur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARVC7L"&gt;Impact: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6cSVB"&gt;Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved memory handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RahuVG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30807"&gt;CVE-2021-30807&lt;/a&gt;: an anonymous researcher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wiMhgM"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/apple-patches-actively-exploited-mac-ios-security-flaw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is the 13th zero-day vulnerability Apple has fixed this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parking lots and airports don’t count for rural broadband funding, FCC tells SpaceX</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Mobile World Congress 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6tZZG3_ft2KXzAY7ACCgR49m9uk=/0x0:1552x1035/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636145/1233721222.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OlT3fd"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission told SpaceX and other companies on Monday that the billions in rural broadband subsidies it doled out last year can’t be used in already connected areas like “parking lots and well-served urban areas,” citing complaints. The commission, in an effort to “clean up” its subsidy auction program, offered the companies a chance to rescind their funding requests from areas that already have service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJ8GN0"&gt;The companies that got the subsidies must do the work to determine they qualify for the money, wrote Michael Janson, director of the FCC’s Rural Broadband Task Force, in a letter addressed to SpaceX’s finance director David Finlay. Similar letters, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/spacex-challenged-by-u-s-fcc-on-bid-for-rural-broadband-subsidy?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, were sent to other recipients of the commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, a $9.2 billion auction to expand broadband into rural areas that lack or have no service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pivzga"&gt;SpaceX’s satellite internet network Starlink won $886 million last December as part of the RDOF program, with 196 other companies also getting a chunk of the $9.2 billion. After the awards, reports from organizations like Competitive Carriers Association, an advocacy group, highlighted widespread flaws and waste with the FCC’s approach. “Pervasive errors in broadband data will soon send hundreds of millions of dollars of Federal broadband subsidies to areas of the country least in need of support,” &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1050650786049/FINAL%20CCA%20Ex%20Parte%20%26%20White%20Paper%20-%2005.06.2021%20(clean).pdf"&gt;a May CCA report said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgTd29"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freepress.net/our-response/expert-analysis/insights-opinions/space-x-broadband-coming-empty-traffic-island-near-you"&gt;Another report from Free Press&lt;/a&gt;, a media policy organization, found that over $700 million of RDOF funds were being spent to deploy broadband to areas that already have it, calling the rural internet program “riddled with errors, waste and insufficient oversight.” $111 million of SpaceX’s $886 million share, the report found, was going to well-served urban areas and random patches of land with no infrastructure, from thin highway medians and empty patches of grass to New York City parking lots and big-box stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NptXSt"&gt;The RDOF subsidies were announced under former FCC chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican who left office when President Biden became president. Free Press had criticized the RDOF program under Pai’s leadership and lauded Rosenworcel’s oversight after the letters were distributed to RDOF companies on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDgT6Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s XR20 is a rugged 5G phone with three years of OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWk9zLOuML5RGakjFRGFx3rkU9Q=/0x70:1646x1167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636026/Nokia_XR20_Workshop__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 includes a 6.67-inch screen and dual rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMNx1D"&gt;HMD Global’s newest Nokia device is the XR20, a rugged phone with 5G connectivity that goes on sale in late August for $549. In addition to robust physical protection, the XR20 is well supported on the software side — a big focus for Nokia’s latest devices — as it ships with Android 11 and comes with three years of OS upgrades alongside four years of monthly security updates. Even considering that the first of those updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, is due for release very soon, it’s a policy that’s far stronger than that of most midrange Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUPJRp"&gt;The XR20 has a long list of rugged specs. It’s IP68 rated and can withstand submersion in 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) of water for up to an hour. It also meets other criteria of the MIL-STD 810H standard, like the ability to withstand temperatures from 131° F (55° C) down to -7.6° F (-22° C) and protection against drops from up to 5.9 feet (1.8 meters). Its screen uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Gorilla Glass Victus&lt;/a&gt;, which Nokia boasts is the “toughest screen yet” on one of its smartphones. You can also take comfort in the fact that the phone comes with a two-year extended warranty in the US (three years in the UK). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_F_Ou9mvWc9EIhWZI49TtryylQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22737064/Nokia_XR20_Hero_Image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 meets rugged specifications for water submersion, drops, and extreme temperatures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7Mdl4"&gt;Beyond its rugged credentials, the Nokia XR20 bears many similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;the non-rugged X20&lt;/a&gt;, starting with its 6.67-inch 1080p screen. It skips the X20’s macro and depth sensors, offering just two rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel f/1.79 main and a 13-megapixel f/2.4 ultrawide. Internally, it’s equipped with a Snapdragon 480 processor along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a combination we found to be adequate with some occasional hiccups in the X20. There’s a 4,630mAh battery and Qi wireless charging is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vZ3ag"&gt;In terms of raw hardware specs, it’s not positioned to challenge the very best midrange phones like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (making way for the 5A soon), which tracks with Nokia’s recent emphasis on value-driven devices. The X20’s camera didn’t impress us, and the Snapdragon 480 chipset likely won’t provide best-in-class performance, but the XR20 could potentially fill a gap in the market for an affordable, mainstream rugged device with healthy software support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxnldw"&gt;The 6GB RAM / 128GB storage variant will be the only one sold in the US, with availability starting August 24th. That version will sell for £449 in the UK, where a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage option will also be available for £399. Both will be available in the UK from July 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIZ8HznVWT8VZaeJIACzXGi8NCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741417/Nokia_C30___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia C30 includes a huge 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dt6AkU"&gt;Nokia C30, Nokia 6310 feature phone, and Clarity Earbuds Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="x6p5hg"&gt;HMD is also announcing a couple of other devices for global release: the Nokia C30 and Nokia 6310. The C30 is a big-screen, big-battery affair, with a huge 6.82-inch panel — Nokia’s largest to date — and a 6,000mAh battery. A version with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage will go on sale in the UK in September for £99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tLxLATVgQFcA_SNbugAPyHjBNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741432/TWS_841W_BKGY_A01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ruxRR1"&gt;The Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation, are IPX5 sweat and water-resistant, and offer up to nine hours of use on a single charge (seven with ANC enabled). The included case supplies an additional 36 hours of use without ANC or 28 hours with it enabled. They’ll go on sale in the UK in September for £99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rosKMgq11gQKIA412LQLXCgxv_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741425/Nokia_6310___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia 6310 features basic 2G connectivity and emphasizes accessibility. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a2pzKM"&gt;Finally, the Nokia 6310 is a 2G-only phone designed with accessibility in mind, including larger buttons and fonts, and users can have texts read aloud. It goes on sale in the UK in August for £49.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms Z Fold 3 S Pen support as Note line is in limbo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Unpacked invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mD9JkOpc9idzrzfST51xY0Zj__o=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636009/unpacked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung Unpacked invitation | Samsunng&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcbyYm"&gt;Samsung isn’t looking to have many surprises at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;August 11th Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks have already revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;Galaxy smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;new Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Samsung mobile president TM Roh is continuing a recent tradition of &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/unfold-next-era-of-smartphone-innovation/"&gt;publishing a pre-event blog post&lt;/a&gt; that confirms some news, sets expectations, and hints at some additional details. Roh promises improved durability for folding screens, stylus support, and that Samsung will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; release a new Note phone this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rqEbz"&gt;Although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Unpacked invitation pictured above&lt;/a&gt; didn’t leave much to the imagination, Roh simply comes out and says there will be new foldables this year: “Our third generation of foldable devices will open up amazing new multitasking capabilities and enhanced durability,” he writes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPq2rq"&gt;The key phrase to pay attention to there is “enhanced durability,” a theme Roh hits on again when he touches on the Z Flip 3, writing that it will have “an even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger materials.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rwygvz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung promises “more durable, stronger materials”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6HrLzz"&gt;Each successive iteration of Samsung’s folding phones has improved screen durability — starting from the total debacle of the first canceled product on through a refined plastic screen and finally “Ultra Thin Glass.” It’s as yet unclear what exactly Samsung will do to improve durability further, but there’s absolutely still &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgAKSnMH0s&amp;amp;t=621s"&gt;room to improve&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSh29p"&gt;A recent leak shows that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case"&gt;two folding phones may have IPX8 water resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which could be part of this durability story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rMl0V"&gt;Durability is a vital spec for folding phones, but it will be doubly important for the upcoming Z Fold 3, which Roh confirms will have stylus support. It may not work with the existing S Pens that are designed for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, however, as Roh indicates that Samsung will announce “the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2GJ3V"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/"&gt;recent leak at &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that there will be a case for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 that will have a place to store the new S Pen, slotted directly in the middle behind the hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df-Rb3lQUoCWfx8LGvHu7TVAxSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741284/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gXEKFS"&gt;Roh is also setting another expectation: there won’t be a Galaxy Note announced this year, writing: “instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTCuzn"&gt;Samsung hinted that it might skip making a Note this year in March, when, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;an earnings call, it said&lt;/a&gt; that “it could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year.” That’s likely a reference to the ongoing chip shortage, but there are other question marks around the Note line in general. Now that the regular Samsung Galaxy S21 line has stylus support, it seems the main benefit of getting a Note is having a place to store the stylus. It’s an open question whether Samsung actually intends to continue making Galaxy Note devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oGCSV"&gt;Finally, Roh’s post makes some vague references to “collaborations with trusted industry leaders like Google and Microsoft,” with a hint that it could mean better support for multitasking on the Z Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3jsoD"&gt;Hopefully, it also means that Samsung, Google, and Microsoft are working together to normalize how multitasking works on Android. Ever since folding phones started appearing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21417432/foldable-phones-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-flip-5g-microsoft-duo"&gt;specter of fragmentation has haunted them&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung and Microsoft each offer different experiences for how to organize and manage different windows on their screens. Although Google has regularly added support for folding features to Android, it hasn’t taken a strong hand in ensuring phones from different manufacturers work in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="txFEyr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fold, Flip, or Duo: why fold a phone?|95266" data-volume-uuid="df76ea051" data-volume-id="95266" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-131" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGhPOe"&gt;Finally, Roh gestures to Samsung’s collaboration with Google on the new Wear OS 3 smartwatch platform. He confirms that Samsung will continue to integrate its watches with its Galaxy software ecosystem, pointing out that both Samsung health and SmartThings will continue to be on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DDAnd"&gt;Samsung’s fall 2020 Unpacked event will be online only on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. You can expect full coverage that day — and likely more leaks before then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla rewrote its own software to survive the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJj5Ojk1nf4MTvmkMtKH6HygTng=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635957/sokane_181114_3101_gigafactory_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NGybaU"&gt;Tesla is weathering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; by rewriting its vehicle software to support alternative chips, CEO Elon Musk said during an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin"&gt;earnings call Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The shortage has upended the auto industry at a time of historic demand for new cars, leading to factory shutdowns, longer wait times, and higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFsSFf"&gt;“We were able to substitute alternative chips, and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks,” Musk said. “It’s not just a matter of swapping out a chip; you also have to rewrite the software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spEdyW"&gt;This approach has helped Tesla maintain high levels of production, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk"&gt;delivering over 200,000 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to customers over the course of the last three months, the company said. Tesla generated $11.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, including $1.1 billion in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMYjlL"&gt;Tesla isn’t alone in feeling the effects of the global shortage. With demand for cars at an all-time high, automakers around the world are feeling the constraints of production with chips in short supply. This week, Daimler and BMW said the lack of chips has forced it to shutdown some of their assembly lines, which will cut the companies’ output by tens of thousands of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NQHILw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The global chip shortage situation remains quite serious”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IplDvm"&gt;Musk said that Tesla’s future growth will depend on a swift resolution to the global semiconductor shortage. “The global chip shortage situation remains quite serious,” he said. “For the rest of this year, our growth rate will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain,” which includes the wide range of chips used in Tesla’s vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouor7i"&gt;Tesla relies on chips to power everything from its airbags to the modules that control the vehicles’ seatbelts — which now means Tesla is missing components that are essential for the vehicle’s safety features. “A big struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and seatbelts,” Musk said. “And obviously you cannot ship a car without those.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvTMBo"&gt;Musk sounded an uncertain note about the future. “It does seem like it’s getting better,” he said, “but it’s hard to predict.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Samsung Flip and Fold leaks show water resistance, renders, and an S Pen case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s91v6aTK9pHTIzOY64XmeW_Nqj4=/151x0:1050x599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635852/E7Ow9IyXsAAEUyS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSyQ2S"&gt;New leaks suggest Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 will both have IPX8 water resistance, which would put them more on par with Samsung’s non-folding phones. The information was posted earlier by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1417721222054481922"&gt;Max Weinbach&lt;/a&gt; and now corroborated by Evan Blass, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370"&gt;tweeted the rating &lt;/a&gt;along with what appears to be an image from Samsung showing the phones getting splashed. The water resistance tidbit adds to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;pile of leaks and images&lt;/a&gt; that we’ve seen leading up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung’s August 11th Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, where the phones are expected to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2X8ud"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-and-z-flip-3-water-resistance-rating-has-a-catch-22683600/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SlashGear &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the rumored IPX8 rating for the phones doesn’t cover dust resistance, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498773/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-durability-test-jerryrigeverything-dust-dirt-hinge"&gt;that’s been a bit of a concern&lt;/a&gt; since Samsung started making folding phones. (&lt;a href="https://www.enclosurecompany.com/ip-ratings-explained.php"&gt;This explainer&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of going over how IP ratings work.) However, an official water resistance rating would likely be a relief for those worried about the durability of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;historically expensive&lt;/a&gt; handsets. It also lets the phones fit in better with the rest of Samsung’s flagships, which have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00077679/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had water resistance for years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zIjgaI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Few upcoming foldable details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Z Flip3&lt;br&gt;- 6.7" internal / 1.9" cover displays&lt;br&gt;- 12MP x2 (rear) / 10MP (selfie)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Z Fold3&lt;br&gt;- 7.6" internal / 6.2" external displays&lt;br&gt;- 12MP x3 (rear) / 10MP (cover selfie) / 4MP (main selfie)&lt;br&gt;- 2 optional S-Pens (Pro and Fold Edition)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both phones IPX8 &lt;a href="https://t.co/lPm60yCzvt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lPm60yCzvt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1419674682543034370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T4y9KH"&gt;Blass’ tweet also mentions the camera and screen specs for the phones, as well as the S Pen options that will reportedly be available for the Z Fold 3. Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders/"&gt;a separate leak&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve also got an idea how Samsung wants us to attach the stylus to the phone: using a case that fits it in right over the hinge. It’s a similar approach to how Samsung handled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22226594/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-stylus-support-price-unpacked-event"&gt;the inclusion of pen support on the Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, though maybe a touch more elegant. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vJ1nF48BvfHUBHdfa9jarLI9n9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741483/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pen slides in right over the Z Fold 3’s hinge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73oSViiAydEQ3gIywXVZpbLJMmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741487/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_06.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It kind of looks like the world’s coolest PDA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V0Ymkk"&gt;We’ve also seen what are reportedly &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124267.html"&gt;leaked official marketing renders of the Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, giving us a good look at the bigger outside screen and re-oriented dual cameras (though they unfortunately don’t show the fun two-tone color scheme we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;seen in previous leaks&lt;/a&gt;). The outside screen on the original Z Flip and Z Flip 5G was tiny, relegating the notifications and clock to a corner of the phone’s cover. The next generation seems to be making it easier for those trying to see their notifications, or take selfies with the main cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gPgUlcWEdkwVchFoVbV4MUvfrRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741706/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Flip_3_1627318291_0_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124267.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen and cameras on the Z Flip’s lid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAW29DCD_gs46-2KQLn-JaOCWPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741711/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Flip_3_1627318229_0_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124267.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The inside of the phone looks mostly familiar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9rkik0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Steps towards making foldables less of an extravagant purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NFnlLS"&gt;The rumors of water resistance and the Z Fold’s S Pen compatibility point towards Samsung’s foldable phones receiving features that its more traditional phones have already gotten. It would be a step towards making them less of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;an extravagant purchase&lt;/a&gt; and more of a practical one, but there’s still a ways to go — even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260357/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-price-drop-1200"&gt;when discounted&lt;/a&gt;, the Z Flip 5G and Z Fold 2 come at a price premium, and can be worse in some ways (looking at you, Z Flip camera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3UBc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DOJ reportedly considers filing criminal charges against Tether and Bitfinex execs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A smartphone displays the Tether market value on the stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZgOLQCFeFgTOUuaHnF1grtbR4d0=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635795/1025441174.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Guillaume Payen/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M6KbYq"&gt;More than three years after initial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16951928/us-cftc-subpoena-bitfinex-tether-fiat-stablecoin-fraud-suspicions"&gt;reports of a federal investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the cryptocurrency stablecoin Tether, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?srnd=economics-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that it remains a “potential” criminal case. In response to the report, the price of Bitcoin surged, briefly rising over $40,000 for the first time since mid-June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jQDXP"&gt;Unlike Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, a stablecoin ties its value to another asset — which, in this case, is one US dollar — backed by actual money or other holdings. It’s useful for traders to instantly make moves without worrying about rapid swings in the market. However, as &lt;a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/"&gt;many have documented&lt;/a&gt;, going back to 2014 when Tether was introduced, there are parts of its history that don’t add up to the story it’s telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AC6HJj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is business as usual at Tether”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YKWxGn"&gt;It’s that early history that the report claims prosecutors are focused on — specifically if Tether executives committed bank fraud and hid the nature of its cryptocurrency transactions from banks. In February, Tether and its owner Bitfinex &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal%5C"&gt;reached a settlement with the New York Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; that included paying $18.5 million in penalties without admitting or denying accusations from the AG that the companies “made false statements about the backing of the ‘tether’ stablecoin, and about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars between the two companies to cover up the truth about massive losses by Bitfinex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R9fw7"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://tether.to/tether-responds-to-bloomberg-article/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, Tether called the story a “repackaging of stale claims” based on unnamed sources and old allegations. The company says, “Tether routinely has open dialogue with law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, as part of our commitment to cooperation, transparency, and accountability...It is business as usual at Tether, and we remain focused on how to best serve the needs of our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="USGxSy"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. Right now, for instance, you can get a new pair for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also currently &lt;a href="https://www.staplesconnect.com/weeklyad"&gt;available in-store at Staples&lt;/a&gt; for $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which include either a wired or wireless charging case. Although they normally retail for $160, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, you can get them for $150 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are a couple of deals going on right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-black%2F-%2FA-82026965&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are offering the Galaxy Buds Pro for $30 off, bringing the price down to $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4pY4R1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus for $100 at places such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744671489647358892#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/3Pk6Pr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live are a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52C6bu"&gt;Right now, you can purchase a pair of the Galaxy Buds Live for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1577733-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r180nznaxar_galaxy_buds_live_noise_canceling.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744671875847416917#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, more than 10 percent off their initial MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i2Ah0B"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, but they haven’t been discounted yet given how recently they launched. Their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, however, remain an excellent pair of headphones that do routinely go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Typically $230, Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $198 and $200, respectively, a notable uptick from their Prime Day pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8F3h1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9wJvFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 35,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;Other true wireless earbuds deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. If you can live with those compromises, however, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for $230 — the standard list price — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740940140202691153" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-85t?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_campaign=100084481&amp;amp;cjevent=d1b5f6f7b81f11eb80a000a90a1c0e0c#/donotlink#100-99190700-98" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the standard retail price on the Elite 85t is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. We consider the Jabra 75t — currently on sale in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B082Y256ZV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$113 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744674062317456142#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; may have just launched, but if you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available right now for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744674259269836975#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTR418/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPowerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones-with-Apple-H1-Headphone-Chip-Black%2F587866546%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up either the black, blue, or white model for $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;Much like their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; represent a tremendous value. Amazon’s latest true wireless earbuds offer improved comfort and better noise cancellation, along with a terrific passthrough mode that ensures you can always hear what’s going on around you. They also feature hands-free Alexa support and sound remarkably satisfying, with more bass than AirPods Pro and an appropriate amount of restraint when it comes to the high end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhZp6r"&gt;Although they normally retail for $120, they’re now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747338177907879421#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Best Buy for a $80&lt;/a&gt;, more than 30 percent off Amazon’s typical retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PgPi8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Intel will make Qualcomm chips in new foundry deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wJkssiUJx-bjY6M6RfVdemJmqo=/25x0:1447x948/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69635723/Screen_Shot_2021_07_26_at_5.38.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgyDkH"&gt;Intel has announced its first major customer for its new Intel Foundry Services business: Qualcomm. Best known for designing the Snapdragon chips that power most major Android phones, Qualcomm will start to have its chips manufactured by Intel in the coming years using Intel’s upcoming 20A process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUw67K"&gt;No timeframe has been announced for when the first Intel-made Qualcomm chips will arrive or which of Qualcomm’s products Intel will produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MQ9mNW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Intel has a new architecture roadmap and a plan to retake its chipmaking crown in 2025","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hqO8J0"&gt;Additionally, Amazon’s AWS will be working with Intel Foundry Services, relying on Intel’s packaging solutions (although Intel won’t be directly making chips for Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZbM9Os9JAAgM5_lfMAqhi5zU2M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741735/Screen_Shot_2021_07_26_at_5.33.38_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NEwDcD"&gt;Qualcomm will rely on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;Intel’s newly announced Intel 20A technology&lt;/a&gt; node, scheduled for release in 2024. Intel 20A will introduce a new transistor architecture, RibbonFET, Intel’s first since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAlblx"&gt;Intel previously announced its new foundry business as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s “IDM 2.0” strategy&lt;/a&gt; shortly after he took the reins of the company. Intel Foundry Services was a key part of that plan, one that would see Intel expand beyond making its own chips to handle production for third-party companies. Qualcomm and Amazon mark the first — and the highest-profile — partners that Intel has announced so far for IFS, although Gelsinger has previously mentioned that Intel is in talks with over 100 companies for foundry work. &lt;/p&gt;
