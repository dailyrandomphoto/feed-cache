    <title>The PS5’s UI could really use some work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6X2Ovq90jjv8Bt3siWkWLh8vZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67852002/vpavic_4278_20201030_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C2L0zZ"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation 5 user interface could really use some work, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the simple act of trying to turn the thing off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NiRIR"&gt;On most recent consoles, it’s been pretty easy to shut down the device with just the controller. Simply press and hold the PS button / Xbox button / home button, and the UI will helpfully show you an option to power down the console in some way. This is true for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It takes just a few seconds, and I can happily end a gaming session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDrj2E"&gt;But turning off the PS5, for no good reason that I can figure out, is a needlessly cumbersome process. Instead, when I press and hold the PS button — the behavior I have used for years to start the process — I’m taken back to the main PS5 menu where I’m presented with options like picking a different game to play, checking out the PlayStation Store, or opening a media app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1XDfD"&gt;Instead, Sony has buried the option to turn off the console in the quick actions menu that appears with a &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; tap of the PS button instead of a press and hold. But even when I pull that menu up, I have to spend a few seconds navigating to the unlabeled icon representing power (you probably know the one — the circle with the vertical line through the top) and opening it up. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; I see the options to shut down my PS5. You can also shut down the console after logging out from your account, but that’s not exactly a speedy option, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vi3J1J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Xbox Series X, by comparison, is very easy to turn off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcXLug"&gt;The Xbox Series X, by comparison, is very easy to turn off. You just press and hold the Xbox button, and on the menu that appears, tap up and select if you’d like to turn off the console or controller or restart the console. Shutting down the Switch is even easier: press and hold the home button, and the menu that appears already has the sleep mode option selected, requiring just one more button press to turn the system off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ahfpl"&gt;Turning off the PS5 is just one of many other frustrating issues I’ve experienced with the console’s UI. The way trophies are displayed is a step backward, for example. Instead of a vertically scrolling list, PS5 trophies are shown as a long, horizontal row of large cards. It’s harder to quickly browse through them, and they show less information at a glance. One of my colleagues has taken to checking her trophies using the PlayStation mobile app, which has... a vertically scrolling list, just like it remains on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlJjjF"&gt;Taking screenshots and captures off the console is also a pain, especially compared to the Xbox Series X. On the Series X, screenshots and captures are automatically synced to the Xbox mobile app, where I can save them to my phone. But on PS5, the only way to share captured media is by uploading it to another platform directly from the PS5 or transferring it to a USB drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q18Ity"&gt;And sometimes, when I boot up the PS5 to jump into another hellish play session with &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, the console opens not the game I was playing last but instead the Explore menu, which shows news and trailers about games. Right now, it’s showing me a card for an upcoming map in &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, a game that I don’t own and don’t want to play. To actually jump into the game I was playing before I turned the console off and the reason I’m waking it up again, I have to navigate one-directional tap over to the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; icon. It’s a small inconvenience but just one of many problems that make for a frustrating experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPL4Ph"&gt;I do like the PS5 a lot. Sony hyped up the console’s ultra-fast SSD for months, and it’s been a revelation to jump from world to world in &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; with hardly any wait time. But that ethos of speed doesn’t seem to be applied to the day-to-day moments of using the console’s UI, and I really hope that Sony updates it soon to make things a bit more seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNhXuc"&gt;But until then, you can listen for me cursing under my breath when I forget, yet again, that it’s a short press to get to the power menu, not a long one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Buds can now track your running workouts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDhWghq1dPMRO-Rzr3nWuU-YaeQ=/0x0:2080x1387/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851998/IMG_0336.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="37jXM2"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Buds are getting new fitness features that allow the true wireless earbuds to track your workouts. According to Amazon, the Echo Buds now have the ability to track walks, runs, and other workouts, all initiated with Alexa voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yenJhw"&gt;The Echo Buds rely on built-in accelerometers for tracking steps, and this is used in combination with personal stats entered into a “workout profile” in the Alexa app for other data. Amazon says using your height and weight, in combination with the steps tracked by the accelerometer, the Echo Buds can calculate the distance of your runs and walks and the amount of calories burned. The duration of your workout is calculated using timestamps, and your overall pace is calculated by the duration and distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgahsV"&gt;You can start a workout with “Alexa, start my run” and check on your progress with commands like “Alexa, how far have I run?” or “Alexa, what’s my pace?” Past workout data will be viewable in the Alexa app as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L2aHta"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Amazon Echo Buds hands-on|73072" data-volume-uuid="23c744c9c" data-volume-id="73072" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-729" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NS6QFV"&gt;Fitness tracking was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20880415/amazon-wireless-earbuds-alexa-size-larger-echo-rumor"&gt;rumored to be part of Amazon’s plans&lt;/a&gt; for the Echo Buds but wasn’t offered at launch, so this new feature is welcome. It arrives after another health- and fitness-focused play from Amazon in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;the Amazon Halo fitness band&lt;/a&gt;. But unlike the Halo band, which can estimate your level of body fat using actual photos of your body, the Buds stick to the fitness basics. They’re also aggressively priced in comparison to other fitness tracking headphones — and this functionality is something that Apple’s AirPods don’t offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuPyLA"&gt;Amazon says the new update should start rolling out to owners over the next few days, just in time for holiday feasting and the guilt-associated exercise that follows. If you’re interested in the Echo Buds as a potential stocking stuffer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price"&gt;check out our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Taylor Lyles? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQXNtIAn-pH83zaecuXCC5kB97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851875/tlyles_201113_4294_0017.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An enthusiastic gamer creates her workspace&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="uJLbW5"&gt;Moving to a home office sometimes means making the most of a little space. Taylor Lyles, a writer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is one of those who has used imagination and tech know-how to create a great working area out of a small part of her room. Here’s how she did it. (And if you’re curious, a list of her tech is at the end of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xvUDW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, tell us a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9mT50"&gt;I’m from Maryland, born and raised. I live outside of Annapolis, which is the capital of the state. I joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year as a news writer and my one-year anniversary is coming up in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CejAAW"&gt;I am currently listed as a writer. “News” was dropped from my title, which primarily means that I place a lot more emphasis on service journalism. Basically, I find a lot of good deals for our readers so they can best spend the money that’s burning a hole in their pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfaTko"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4Jca"&gt;Yeah! My desk is in the same room as my bed, and it is close to my two-door closet. I previously had two other smaller desks instead of the one I currently have, but when it came to finding a new desk, I wanted something that was spacious yet also fit in the parameters I designated. A measuring tape was my best friend for sure! Funnily enough, I now have a 45-inch desk, but I could put a larger one in the space, and it wouldn’t feel cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlNgyqS9wvGUYCXjWGv8D01PshE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054931/tlyles_201111_4294_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyPcxU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkUXHH"&gt;It’s a gaming desk by this company called Mr. Ironstone. In case it’s not obvious, I am a huge gamer, and I’ve always wanted to have a desk that was considered a “gaming desk.” I spent a few weeks researching a few different types of gaming desks, and eventually, I went with the Mr. Ironstone Gamer Workstation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbgoyO"&gt;A few people have said it’s minimal, but I am a very simple woman, and to be quite honest, a minimalist desk is the best because it provides you with more freedom and a ton of real estate to allow you to decorate your desk how you like. Shockingly, this is one of the cheapest desks I have used; it cost only $126 when I ordered it on Amazon. Ultimately, I decided to buy this desk because it came with a few neat things on the side (a cup holder and a headset hook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MSc5n3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Mr. Ironstone Gamer Workstation","description":"Gaming desk","label":"$120 at Amazon","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-Computer-Headphone-Workstation/dp/B07HYTWJ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;amp;linkId=3ddff728b756455213eb9564624e2d93&amp;amp;amp;language=en_US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3QMl94"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the cup holder. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsmjIm"&gt;The cup holder is one of my favorite parts of this desk! I did have a coaster and a headset mount on my old desk, but I did not like how they took up space on what was already a small desk to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3LZKb"&gt;The best part is that you can choose which side you put your headset hook and cup holder on. I chose to put the cup holder to my left because I am a lefty and my headset hook on the right because it is closer to my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AzS4tkUmNAaVLG0LxITuPhoAXh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054937/tlyles_201111_4294_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZcz_K4B2ydL9xRiRjqYYSGYrdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054901/tlyles_201113_4294_0032.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmLrJD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really great-looking chair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91lqvl"&gt;It’s a Techni Sport TS-5000, and although it looks comfy, it’s actually very uncomfortable. I had to purchase a seat cushion because sitting on the chair for more than two hours made my butt hurt. I also have a weak back so, thankfully, I have cushions that provide extra comfort for my back and my butt, allowing me to work (or game) comfortably at my desk. I am planning to get a Secretlab Titan gaming chair soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GfMqYB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Secretlab Titan","description":"Gaming chair","label":"$459 from Secretlab","url":"https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WSzKt3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. That’s quite a system you have there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjDPHQ"&gt;This is my gaming PC! Someone I knew gave me the case, and I bought and built the PC myself. I am currently in the process of upgrading my rig, but I want to point out a few things: the GPU I am using is an Asus RTX 3070, and my processor is an Intel Core i7-7700K. But within the next few months, I plan to switch my CPU and motherboard to AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfFCzz"&gt;The biggest focus I had for my gaming PC was I wanted to make sure I could play the newest titles without having to sacrifice performance or graphics. I also try to plan 10 steps ahead in future-proofing my PC, especially with the new generation of gaming underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6GkkRgYngyLbbLV0oxOMAGHn1R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22055628/tlyles_201113_4294_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Taylor Lyles / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BciK0VTCzVIEd7OF3Si9SJBugU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054904/tlyles_201113_4294_0027.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf0oAH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your displays? How did you decide on two, and how do you use them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyWgRV"&gt;The gamer in me always wanted two displays. It also makes multitasking easier. Both monitors are 24 inches. The one on the right is an Asus MG248QR, the original one for my gaming PC, and the one on the left is newer, the Asus VG258QR. Eventually, I will upgrade to 4K monitors, but for now, these get the job done just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yZw48"&gt;My left monitor is the one I work on the most. The second one is what I use to keep my Slack app open. I split reading material on the right between two windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP4mIJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve admired your microphone setup ever since the first time I saw it. Tell us about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neY5Jy"&gt;Thank you! The microphone I am using is called the HyperX QuadCast, and it’s amazing! Previously, I had a few other mics, including a Blue Yeti. I chose the HyperX QuadCast as my new mic because I heard great things about the sound quality, and the design was also really intriguing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YoAWa"&gt;The QuadCast has a lot of bang for the buck, and I like how it comes with a stand for your mic and a shock mount in case you decide to place it on a boom arm, which is what I did. And it comes with a nice long cable, so you have more leverage for where to place it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6No8CQ"&gt;The boom arm I am using is from TONOR, and it is an adjustable suspension boom scissor mic stand that costs about $30. What’s great about this boom arm is that it includes a durable clamp, so if you have a heavier mic like, say, a Blue Yeti, it will be compatible with the boom arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1OEhl"&gt;You’ll also notice I have a pop filter on my mic. The QuadCast does have a built-in bright red pop filter, but unfortunately, it is not very good at stopping plosive speech sound. I didn’t want to use the “normal” pop filter, which came with the boom arm I bought, so I bought this PEMOTech tri-layered pop filter. I bought it for $8, and aside from looking cool, it does help with the plosives. It gives off such a very professional look in my opinion that it makes me want to have a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNMmW-O6etQiEFpY9wxcWi5raf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054922/tlyles_201113_4294_0014.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EjdXWm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r28hpT"&gt;Most of the tech I use for my computer is from Logitech. I have a Logitech BRIO webcam, a Logitech G635 7.1 gaming headset, a Logitech G910 RGB gaming keyboard, and a Logitech G502 gaming mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIcFjV"&gt;The speakers you see hiding in the back are the Razer Nommo Chroma, and I use those for listening to music or podcasts in the background while I work. That flight stick is the Extreme 3D Pro Joystick, which I use exclusively to play &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; on my PC. The two controllers are for gaming: the Razer Wolverine is for fighting games mostly, while I use the Patrol Tech Special Edition Xbox One wireless controller for certain PC games (mostly platformers). Most of my PC gaming is done on my keyboard, but hey — never hurts to have some options, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y126zh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk a little about your toys. Which are your favorites, and are there any interesting stories you’d like to share about any of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yg3RLz"&gt;I received the Rubik’s Cube as a gift from a friend a few years ago for my birthday. I know how to solve it, but I simply have not had the time. The fidget spinner is neat, too. Usually when I need a screen break, I just play with the fidget spinner a bit to relax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8eXfR1"&gt;I purchased the Elago AW4 AirPods case because I was afraid I would misplace my pair of earbuds. Most of my family have these same earbuds, so I wanted to make sure that I could tell my case from the rest. It also looks really cute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KNRnR1Z0UR-McHr08vWZf5x8OJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054911/tlyles_201113_4294_0022.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIzqbMjmlUqPGLRXbIv9KRwWzJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054936/tlyles_201111_4294_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUSFf6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a wonderful banner you have hung up behind your desk! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHB9Bb"&gt;Aw, shucks. This was the thing I was really excited to share with you. I love collecting flags. I have about nine or 10 right now, but only four of them are hanging up at the moment. The one you see above my desk is the Maryland flag (aka the best state flag &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;). In case it’s not clear, I have a lot of state pride. I actually asked my mom to give me a Maryland flag as a high school graduation gift back in 2013, and it’s one of the handful of things that I consider my most prized possessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOt6L5"&gt;I am sure you can see the American flag above my bed, too. I bought that one a year later when I was looking to redesign my room. I know some people will have their critiques of America as a whole, but I love being American, and I think our country has an incredible flag. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is hosting a Ready Player Two treasure hunt inside its own virtual universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Isywj0nDFwy9VLiXQSwkjsnOhg=/62x0:1585x1015/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851333/Ready_Player_Two_Roblox_Event.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vC6xu"&gt;To promote the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One &lt;/em&gt;— a book about a treasure hunt inside a virtual universe — author Ernest Cline has partnered with the hit kids game &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; to re-create something akin to the plot of the original novel: a hunt for clues and prizes inside a virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt6rRT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; says the treasure hunt will take place across seven different game worlds. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F5967514178%2FA-Mys7erious-Place&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F23%2F21594054%2Fready-player-two-roblox-treasure-hunt-ernest-cline#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The first world is already open&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Freadyplayer2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F23%2F21594054%2Fready-player-two-roblox-treasure-hunt-ernest-cline#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the event&lt;/a&gt; really kicks off on December 1st when a Q&amp;amp;A with Cline and Roblox CEO Dave Baszucki will air inside the game. Players will be “awarded virtual goods” specific to the &lt;em&gt;Ready Player Two &lt;/em&gt;event for completing the treasure hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TY1UMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Roblox is the closest thing to the Oasis in real life.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQCTk5"&gt;Warner Bros. previously partnered with &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; for a similar event to promote the film adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with 13 million people participating. In the two years since, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s usage has soared so a lot more players may end up joining this time. “I think it’s fair to say this is going to be even bigger,” Baszucki said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGGEdd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;filed to go public&lt;/a&gt; last week. The company revealed it now has 31.1 million daily users, up from 12.0 million in 2018, when the &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One &lt;/em&gt;event was held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQDXH3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ready Player Two &lt;/em&gt;comes out on November 24th. The original was a huge hit, and the sequel appears to be pushing the same idea forward, once again sending its protagonist on a treasure hunt through the Oasis, Cline’s fictional metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CclY4X"&gt;Cline hyped up the similarities to the &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;event in a press release, saying, “Roblox is the closest thing to the Oasis in real life, and this contest is the closest thing to the treasure hunt in my book.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast to impose home internet data cap of 1.2TB in more than a dozen US states next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="comcast" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T2fvNXP3zdpE0vhDBPNONoaNIJk=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851151/comcast.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HaAdUk"&gt;Next year, Comcast plans to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Flearn%2Finternet-service%2Fdata%3Fpc%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F23%2F21591420%2Fcomcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charge home internet customers&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern US states for going over 1.2TB of data in a month — a cap that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"&gt;already in effect&lt;/a&gt; for customers on non-unlimited plans in other parts of the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2eUgF"&gt;In January and February, Comcast will give its Xfinity customers not on an unlimited plan a “credit” for any data usage charges over 1.2TB during those months to ease them into the new limits. Then, starting in March, non-unlimited customers who exceed 1.2TB in a month will be charged $10 per 50GB of data, for a maximum of $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YaM9d"&gt;Customers who go over the limit will get one “courtesy” credit per 12 months, so if you go over 1.2TB in March, you get a grace period for April. If you go over again in May, you’ll pay $10 for each block of 50GB up to the $100 max. Customers will be notified as they approach the 1.2TB threshold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzVfyO"&gt;The affected states include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, as well as parts of North Carolina and Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ab8d3O"&gt;According to Comcast, 95 percent of its customers don’t get close to using that much data per month; over the last six months, the median monthly data use was around 308GB. But as the coronavirus pandemic keeps people working from home and students learning remotely, the internet is feeling the strain of the increased use — even though, so far, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-working-from-home-face-internet-usage-limits-11603638000"&gt;it’s held up relatively well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09pR3X"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179330/comcast-t-mobile-coronavirus-data-caps-hotspots-fcc"&gt;Comcast announced in March&lt;/a&gt; it was suspending its data cap policy for 60 days, and would not charge overage fees to home internet customers who exceeded its broadband data caps. It also said it would raise speeds for customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177524/comcast-internet-essentials-speed-increase-coronavirus"&gt;on its Internet Essentials tier&lt;/a&gt;, its broadband plan for low-income families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTxQcU"&gt;Comcast was also one of the providers that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178451/fcc-coronavirus-keep-americans-connected-pledge-att-comcast-charter-att"&gt;committed to the Keep Americans Connected Pledge&lt;/a&gt;, which Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai introduced around the same time. Participating companies agreed not to terminate service for residential or small business customers, waive any late fees incurred because of the economic effects of the pandemic, and open access to public Wi-Fi hotspots to “any American who needs them.” The Keep Americans Connected Pledge officially expired at the end of June, however, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-relief-runs-out-for-cash-strapped-internet-customers-11593617441"&gt;Comcast said at the time&lt;/a&gt; it was “working with customers on flexible payment options that work for them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWIl6X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 23rd 1:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added background about Comcast and the Keep Americans Connected Pledge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Newly named panda cub is still online as National Zoo closes doors  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rP9OK9nCmdcOtcVx4z0ghLl1qIY=/428x0:3668x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851070/20201118_roshanpatel004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nov. 18, 2020: The Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s giant panda cub received a clean bill of health from Zoo veterinarians during his third veterinary exam. They listened to his heart and lungs, checked his eyes and mouth, and tested the range of motion in his limbs. The cub also received his second canine distemper vaccine.   | Image: National Zoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ibyaz9"&gt;The National Zoo and other Smithsonian institutions closed their doors to visitors again today because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the zoo’s &lt;a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams"&gt;webcams&lt;/a&gt; are still live, including the &lt;a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams/panda-cam"&gt;Giant Panda Cam&lt;/a&gt;, which will keep broadcasting adorable footage of the institution’s newly named baby panda during the latest shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="IGA8s6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“little miracle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6DSRSD"&gt;The National Zoo just announced the panda’s name today: Xiao Qi Ji (SHIAU-chi-ji), which is Mandarin for “little miracle.” The zoo left the naming up to voters, who cast almost 135,000 votes online last week for their favorite moniker. Xiao Qi Ji beat out four other options, including Xing Fu (my personal favorite, which translates to “happy and prosperous”) and Zai Zai (a Chinese nickname for a boy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xySKgl"&gt;Xiao Qi Ji’s birth on August 21st was a small miracle, given all the tumult this year — and giant pandas’ already precarious situation in the wild. Scientists think there are less than 1,900 giant pandas left in the wild. The creatures are considered “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their strict diet of almost nothing but bamboo makes threats, like human development and climate change, to the bamboo forests they call home especially menacing to the bears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8ekh2"&gt;It’s also really &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/24/4654478/mei-xiang-panda-birth-smithsonian-national-zoo"&gt;difficult to breed&lt;/a&gt; giant pandas. Xiao Qi Ji’s mom was artificially inseminated. When the zoo first spotted fetal tissue on an ultrasound in August, it said there was still a “substantial possibility” that the mama bear would miscarry or resorb the fetus (a phenomenon &lt;a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/veterinarians-find-fetal-tissue-giant-panda-ultrasound"&gt;scientists still don’t understand&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After five days of voting and just under 135,000 votes, the panda cub at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo is named Xiao Qi Ji (SHIAU-chi-ji), which translates as “little miracle” in English." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nSEYWmPYqY6so4fm7D1ta6jl-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22068198/2020.11.22_giant_panda_cub_xiao_qi_ji_reveal.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: National Zoo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After five days of voting and just under 135,000 votes, the panda cub at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo is named Xiao Qi Ji (SHIAU-chi-ji), which translates as “little miracle” in English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4kMcpr"&gt;The good news is that thanks to conservation efforts, giant pandas were taken off the IUCN’s list of endangered species &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/6/12816588/giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn-list"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The species has become a sort of symbol for hope for conservationists since then. The National Zoo calls the population of giant pandas in zoos “&lt;a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda-faqs"&gt;an insurance policy against extinction&lt;/a&gt;.” The zoo has a long-standing agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association that lets it breed the pandas with the condition that cubs born in the US are sent back to China after four years. The current agreement &lt;a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/news/smithsonians-national-zoo-and-conservation-biology-institute-renews-giant-panda-breeding"&gt;expires at the end of this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1FW5fK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“an insurance policy against extinction”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vY8381"&gt;Xiao Qi Ji has brought some hope and happiness to the zoo during a difficult year. The Smithsonian’s museums and zoo shuttered in March as a precaution during the pandemic, but reopened by September. The institutions are now closing again amid a nationwide surge in coronavirus infections, and they haven’t yet set a date for reopening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIw3Kk"&gt;“Like many who have followed our giant panda cub since his birth last summer, I tune into the Giant Panda Cam from time to time. Watching Xiao Qi Ji always puts a smile on my face,” Steve Monfort, a director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, said in a statement today. “While we’re closed, I encourage you to&lt;a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams/panda-cam"&gt; watch our giant panda cub thrive on the Giant Panda Cam&lt;/a&gt;. He’s such a source of joy!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXj3eL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Qgi9G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Friday deals: what time sales start at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nj1X37"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; will officially kick off on Friday, November 27th, but if you plan to make that the only day you buy gifts for the holiday season, you are missing out. Several retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, are already getting a head start on holiday discounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjhxYw"&gt;Whether you take advantage of the deals now or hold off until Black Friday, it’s important to know how every major retailer is handling Black Friday this year. Due to the pandemic, some retailers are doing things a bit differently, with many consistently offering good deals over the last several weeks leading up to Black Friday. In either case, if you plan to spend some money on Black Friday, here are the schedules for these retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8hxxe2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday mesh router deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21591145/best-black-friday-mesh-router-deals-wifi-sale"},{"title":"The best Black Friday tech deals at Amazon","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583112/amazon-deals-black-friday-tech-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="NNg8qr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fblack-friday%2Fflippable-ad%2Fpcmcat1601484511846.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1601484511846&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SOgpOe"&gt;Best Buy has released &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fblack-friday%2Fflippable-ad%2Fpcmcat1601484511846.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1601484511846&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its plans for Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, including several amazing pre-Black Friday deals over the last several weeks. Most Best Buy locations will open their doors at 5AM local time on November 27th, but the company advises that you check your local store to confirm what time they will open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gqvBI6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fdeals%2Fblack-friday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q4ELcu"&gt;GameStop will open its doors for in-store shopping on Friday, November 27th, at 7AM local time. But if you plan to do some Black Friday shopping through its website, the deals will start will at 9PM ET on Wednesday, November 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8HQiF"&gt;If you are looking to get your hands on a next-gen console, GameStop is the only retailer that will have some in-store stock for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The Black Friday ad notes that all GameStop locations will have a minimum of two PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zyKznb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday GameStop deals include steep discounts on several PS4, Switch, and Xbox One games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21571470/gamestop-black-friday-deals-sale-games-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ujHYp9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-black-friday%2F-%2FN-5q0f2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21569881%2Fblack-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jnNqHP"&gt;Throughout the month of November, &lt;a href="https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2020/10/target-reveals-black-friday-now-deals-available-th"&gt;Target has offered Black Friday discounts&lt;/a&gt;. Target is offering deals on its website, and it announced that nearly all of its “Black Friday Now” deals will be available for contactless, same-day pickup at its locations, meaning you can get the best deals with in-store pickup as early as one hour after purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bKaERq"&gt;&lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fstore%2F1715-easton-md%2Fweekly-ads&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YmIY6n"&gt;Walmart’s Black Friday ad contains a lot of interesting deals. One standout deal is Apple’s AirPods Pro for $169, the lowest we have seen these wireless earbuds to date. Walmart’s Black Friday Deals begin on November 27th; online deals will be available beginning at 12AM ET and 5AM local time if you plan to shop at your local Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to disable Edge’s new URL copy and paste feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcAd9jWuVPG1-RTycViJiBaciM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67850983/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9RmfB"&gt;If you’re using a recent version of Microsoft’s Edge browser, you might have noticed that the way URLs copy and paste &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/improved-copy-and-paste-of-urls-in-microsoft-edge-d3bd3956-603a-0033-1fbc-9588a30645b4#:~:text=a%20hyperlinked%20title%3A-,In%20Microsoft%20Edge%2C%20copy%20the%20URL%20you%20want%20from%20the,to%20paste%20the%20web%20address."&gt;has changed&lt;/a&gt;. As of Edge version 87 for Windows or 88 for macOS, you’ll find that by default trying to copy and paste a URL from an address bar will paste the title of a webpage as a hyperlink rather than its URL directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcY0qC"&gt;So instead of seeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8Hx47m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/"&gt;https://www.theverge.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="q9ZBli"&gt;...like you’d expect to, you’ll instead paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MK06b0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IgT2Om"&gt;Depending on what you’re doing, this might be helpful. If you’re sending an email that you want to be nicely formatted with a hyperlink, then this might save you some time, for example. It’s also possible to still paste a plain URL if you use the Ctrl + Shift + V command to paste the plain URL without formatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrDwJv"&gt;But there are plenty of occasions where you just want to get a URL without having to remember to hold down an extra button. Not to mention the fact that there are a lot of webpages out there with messy titles that don’t share very well. Look at the page title for an individual tweet, for example, and you’ll see that it contains the entire text of the tweet, which ends up looking messy when you’re trying to paste it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s77vOv"&gt;Here’s an example tweet’s URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ych1SB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1330867474817015811"&gt;https://twitter.com/verge/status/1330867474817015811&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KTp2rj"&gt;And here’s what gets pasted using Edge’s new feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JzNphr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1330867474817015811"&gt;The Verge on Twitter: “A different Super Mario Bros. game now holds the title for most expensive ever sold https://t.co/l5NAyNSeA3 https://t.co/FnWuM11kKQ” / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jUkdvP"&gt;Thankfully, it’s a simple process to swap back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GNFyEN"&gt;How to get Edge to copy and paste URLs normally again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zhyhw3"&gt;To change how Edge handles copying and pasting links, click the button with the three dots on it to the right of the toolbar, and select “Settings” from the drop-down menu that appears. On the left, you’ll see a “Share, copy, and paste” section. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEjU7hoC7f6P5iN45EofbmvJUA0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22068158/msedge_nHvPqeXrT6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Settings” from the drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ucU9X9"&gt;Click it, and inside, you’ll have the option of posting either a “Link” by default or “Plain text.” The former will paste the title of a page as a hyperlink by default, while the latter pastes a traditional URL. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNm_hBDi2w5H7T-6V-IEzMMRGnU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22068160/msedge_NijiN2qsp3.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Link” if you want to paste a hyperlinked page title by default, or “Plain text” if you want to paste the URL.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RzuQUf"&gt;That’s it! Remember to apply the setting across all of the profiles you use in Microsoft Edge in case you have different ones set up for home and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEANS7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0Yjl2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6MbF5CQyjuHRwnicglx_NCBGiY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67798744/dbohn_201004_4227_0009.0.9.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kq7sS1"&gt;Speaker deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRx7v2iKWDhr2lI1LUX0smT9vN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208402/dseifert_190915_3647_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sono’s portable Move speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3TO80R"&gt;Sonos has slashed the prices on several of its speakers ahead of Black Friday. Three of its popular models are $100 off right now, a savings of up to 25 percent. You can buy the Sonos Move, the company’s first portable speaker, for just $299 right now at Sonos and Amazon or $300 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="APQVzv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T5kD09"&gt;If you are looking for a soundbar, the Sonos Beam is an excellent starting point. Aside from enhancing the sound quality of games and movies, the Beam has always-listening mics and supports two voice assistants: Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8VDcdO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCcxn5"&gt;If you own a Sonos speaker but want to enhance your sound when watching movies or playing music at the family barbecue, the Sonos Sub will add an extra low-end thump to your Sonos speaker. Normally, this add-on would set you back $700, but you can buy it for just $599 at a few retailers, including Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zCuuw7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="of9IqM"&gt;Headphone deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uPyp1tAFu7ySzKQN1zzQF9Y5QPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336099/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="61vp5x"&gt;You can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose’s excellent Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones&lt;/a&gt; for $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q4QK379?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213175001080094" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1475153-REG%2Fbose_794297_0100_headphones_700_noise_cancelling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F6b3f#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;. The price is only available in “soapstone white,” unfortunately, at all these retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IxWjk2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYOJJg"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;amp;cjevent=bf1dd84529dc11eb814400030a24060c&amp;amp;utm_source=Vox+Media" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are $190 at Woot right now&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest we’ve seen yet on Apple’s flagship earbuds. Compared to the standard AirPods, the Pro model features better sound quality and noise cancellation, plus support for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULP9BI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AhnjK1"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds are down to just $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best price we’ve seen for this model, which usually costs $150 outside of any discounts. Compared to the standard Galaxy Buds, this upgraded model that launched alongside the Galaxy S20 series of phones has improved sound quality, microphones, and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5zWQ0"&gt;If you are looking to buy two pairs of Galaxy Buds Plus, Best Buy has a few bundles, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213386876980609" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;allowing you to buy sets for only $200&lt;/a&gt;. You can mix and match which color you want for both pairs and are available in blue, black, light blue, red, and white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wo6p68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581901" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArxGby"&gt;Alongside the Plus wireless earbuds, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds are discounted at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally, these earbuds would cost $130, but you can get them for $70 at either retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttnzGj"&gt;Unfortunately, the color options are limited at both retailers, so you can only buy these earbuds in either black or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o58dM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586872"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ISaGBC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fjabra-100-99090000-nrc-in-ear-titanium%2Fp%2F0TH-04CN-000K5%3FItem%3D9SIAFWTB5S7462%26cm_sp%3DDailydeal_SS-_-9SIAFWTB5S7462-_-11202020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt; has a deal right now on the Jabra Elite 75t wireless earbuds. You can buy a pair of these earbuds in refurbished condition for just $85.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iPad Pro (2020 model).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LmyLtf"&gt;If you are looking to pick up an iPad Pro this Black Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=59b2301a303437a19ef23fb2e3fafd22&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578293673083745" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have Apple’s high-end iPad Pro for $730. This model includes an 11-inch display and a 128GB storage configuration. If 128GB is not enough storage space for you, both retailers are taking $100 off the 256GB configuration, bringing the price down to $800, which is what you would normally pay if you bought the entry-level 11-inch iPad Pro with the lowest storage configuration. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SyzhPO"&gt;If you like Fitbit’s wearables and prefer to have a smartwatch by the company, you can get the Fitbit Sense smartwatch for $280 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s website&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724580973739712242" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1590667-REG%2Ffitbit_fb512bkbk_sense_gps_smartwatch_carbon.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this model costs $330 and allows you to track your stress levels and measure your blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAW1Mh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlkbsX"&gt;The Apple Watch SE was already the most affordable Watch that Apple made at $279, but it’s even cheaper at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578867741826427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can score the 40mm GPS version for $259 or the larger 44mm Watch for $289 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=e39bfa3f763e4fa56204c59a62303c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578918898824263" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Each size looks similar to the more expensive Series 6 but lacks the always-on display and a few other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Widfy"&gt;The Apple Watch SE aligns more with the Series 5 in terms of specs, but at $259, it’s a fantastic value. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;Here’s an in-depth post&lt;/a&gt; on how the SE differs from other recent Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="imKmLJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffa5rt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6 is also cheaper than usual at Amazon and Walmart. Normally $400 for the 40mm GPS model, it’s down to $330 — but there’s a catch. You must buy this model in either red or blue at Amazon and Walmart only has the red model in this size discounted right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I6L1IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Wifi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="65HtKg"&gt;If you have a large home and want to make sure all of the rooms in it have internet and no dead zones, Amazon and Best Buy has discounted the Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi router. You can get three units for just $479. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jg0NxI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kPHL"&gt;Ahead of Black Friday, Google has discounted several of its products, including the Nest Wifi, and you can buy a two-pack for $219. The Nest Wifi system is easy to set up, and with two units, you can cover up to 4,400 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RtDGBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwgnwv"&gt;If you need a mesh router system that will cover more square feet in your home, you can buy a three-pack Eero 6 mesh router for $223. The mesh routers also include a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, allowing you to connect and control select devices with Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dACyX2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Av0Zih"&gt;If you prefer Netgear products, you can save 22 percent on a two-pack for the company’s Nighthawk mesh router system. It’s designed for homes that have up to 400Mbps of internet speeds. Netgear says its Nighthawk mesh router system provides up to 3,000 square feet in coverage and support for 25 or more devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wX8NXq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603472"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Normally $290, this kit will only cost you $150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WM5ndj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp4b3f"&gt;Circling back to Netgear, its $450 flagship mesh router system is also discounted. You can buy the Orbi RBK752 Wi-Fi 6 mesh router system for $280 at Amazon or Best Buy right now. This is a great product if you need something that will have the bandwidth to stream multiple videos in 4K or 8K resolution in your house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="T6HkwD"&gt;Samsung’s fast T7 USB-C SSD with 1TB of storage normally costs $200, but you can buy this portable SSD for just $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XN4D8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724300631221915412" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It features optional password protection with AES 256-bit encryption and Samsung claims the T7 has up to 1,050MB/s transfer speeds. It’s compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Windows 10, macOS, and Android. Unfortunately, it will not work on iPad or iOS devices and it is not compatible as an external SSD for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. &lt;/p&gt;

It might be tough to imagine when you might next need a durable backpack that can fit a lot of gadgets within, but the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fcollections%2Feveryday-bags%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F21569412%2Fblack-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Everyday” lineup of bags is 20 percent off&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Blx9fM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, the latest installment in Ubisoft’s hack-anything, open-world game, &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fwatch-dogs-legion-standard-edition%2F5cec2d5839798c0870c07698.html%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;is down to $45 at Ubisoft’s official website&lt;/a&gt;, that’s $15 off, while it’s not the lowest we have seen this game go down, this title recently came out and this is still a good discount. What makes this deal even better is that each version will net you an upgrade to the Xbox Series X / S or PS5 copies for free. Even if you don’t have much interest in the game, it’s an affordable way to check out what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556197/xbox-series-s-ray-tracing-watch-dogs-legion"&gt;impressive ray-tracing graphics&lt;/a&gt; look like on the new console hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SZ4g2C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581295"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvFCDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most popular PS4 games released this year. If you have yet to experience Naughty Dog’s latest title, you can pick it up for $30 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Us-Part-II-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DJRFSDF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=fc2d003cd4936f885db857399379224b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724302857718714066" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fthe-last-of-us-part-ii%2F11097389.html%3Fcondition%3DPre-Owned" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest price the game has been marked down to date. If you recently purchased a PS5, you can also play this game via backwards compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="20AIbx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mRedx"&gt;Speaking of popular PS4 games that released this year, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is also on sale at its lowest price ever of $40 at Amazon and Best Buy. Even better? If you purchased a PS5, you can transfer your save data from your PS4 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553494/sony-playstation-5-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-digital-foundry"&gt;experience the game in 60 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, a feature exclusive to Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XG8KV1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Oyb4M"&gt;If you’re having trouble narrowing down what games you want, why not get several? &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fvideo-game-software%2F-%2FN-fhju6%3FNao%3D0&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target is hosting a “get three for the price of two”&lt;/a&gt; deal on video game purchases — even for newer titles like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, to name a few. The list goes on, though one thing that isn’t eligible are first-party Sony games for the PS5, like the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;remake, but you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Godfall, &lt;/em&gt;which is available on Sony’s next-gen console (and on PC.) Even &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; a game coming out next month is eligible for this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image shows the 1TB model, but the 2TB model detailed below looks the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ekCZCJ"&gt;If you want 2TB of fast storage for your PC, Samsung’s 2TB 970 Evo Plus NVMe SSD is $250 at Newegg and Amazon, beating the lowest price by about $40. Over the summer, the price was steady at $350. A PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD like this will fit in only certain kinds of motherboards (so check before you buy). Alternatively, it can also make for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18518127/portable-ssd-external-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-samsung-x5-t5-specs-test-how-to"&gt;very fast USB-C drive&lt;/a&gt; if you get an M.2 enclosure for it.

    <title>Sonos Move, Beam, and Sub are $100 off for Black Friday week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74BNRb-VdjulfXFbN9Siay4QQCM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845470/bfarsace_190826_3621_0077.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sonos Move wireless speaker | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cFY5CE"&gt;Sonos has discounted several of its speakers for the week leading up to Black Friday, including the portable Move, Beam soundbar, and Sub add-on. All three models are $100 off, a significant discount from their regular prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDNf8U"&gt;Sales on Sonos speakers are rare — we typically only see meaningful discounts on them during the holiday shopping season. The company discounted the Move &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/14/21563848/sonos-move-wifi-bluetooth-speaker-alexa-google-assistant-sale-deal-best-buy-amazon-bh-photo"&gt;for the first time just a week ago&lt;/a&gt;; this week’s sale matches that price should you have missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vmx1qK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality"&gt;Sonos Move&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DBFDtg"&gt;The Sonos Move is the company’s first portable speaker with a built-in 11-hour battery that lets you easily move it from room to room, outside, or even take it to an entirely different location. It has similar sound quality to the smaller Sonos One and includes always-on microphones with support for both Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. It normally retails for $400, but this sale brings it down to $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KmrUb7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cm1PC5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Sonos Beam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSIE9i"&gt;The Beam is the company’s entry-level soundbar. It makes it easy to improve the audio quality of movies, TV shows, and video games with just a simple HDMI cable connecting it to your TV. It can also be used for music and grouped with other Sonos speakers for surround sound or multiroom music. It also has always-listening mics with support for the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice assistants. Like the Move, the Beam is usually $400, but is down to $300 for this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKktzg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Nekhh5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Sub-Gen-Wireless-Subwoofer/dp/B087CCZH4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c9MXAo"&gt;Lastly, the Sub is an add-on piece that adds a low-end oomph to any Sonos speaker. It can be used with the Beam or Arc soundbars for more powerful sound when watching movies, or with other Sonos speakers for more floor-thumping music.  The Sub is typically an expensive add-on, at $700. This sale brings it down to a slightly more manageable $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vpjvi3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Chpe8s"&gt;All three models are available in either black or white, though some retailers only carry the black version of the Sub. If you’ve been eying a new Sonos speaker and one of these fits your needs, you’re not likely to find a much better price than now.&lt;/p&gt;
