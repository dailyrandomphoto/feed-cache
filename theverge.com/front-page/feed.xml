    <title>eBay purchases sneaker authentication service Sneaker Con</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dW8O0cZTDjtbLapzeR3fCb8ePTI=/126x0:1490x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207249/Ebay_Sneakers.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: eBay&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mqAsr5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-acquires-sneaker-con-authentication-business/"&gt;eBay has bought out&lt;/a&gt; sneaker authentication service Sneaker Con, a company that gives sneaker-lovers the peace of mind that the kicks they’re purchasing are real. The acquisition builds upon eBay’s existing relationship with the service, which began back in October 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514028/ebay-sneaker-con-authentication-100-guarantee-fake-counterfeit-limited-edition"&gt;when eBay first launched its sneaker vetting process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrsbCl"&gt;When select sneaker brands are purchased for over $100 on eBay, the shoes go through Sneaker Con before reaching the buyer. There, the sneakers are thoroughly vetted by experts who ensure that the sneakers are authentic and match the description of the original listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tJthIf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;1.55 million sneakers have been authenticated on eBay&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMpgon"&gt;The sneakers are then sent to the buyers with tags showing that they’ve been verified. eBay notes that since the start of the initiative, 1.55 million sneakers have been authenticated on eBay. Its stake in the sneaker market also remains steady, as 1.9 million sneakers are available on the platform daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQtaSo"&gt;“The response to our authentication offering has been overwhelming, and this acquisition allows us to continue to transform eBay and bring a higher level of trust and confidence to every transaction,” said Jordan Sweetnam, the SVP and general manager of eBay North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGEmGX"&gt;eBay offers its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fauthenticity-guarantee%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F29%2F22808373%2Febay-sneaker-con-acquisition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Authenticity Guarantee&lt;/a&gt; with not only sneakers but also luxury &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebay-launches-authentication-on-all-watches-sold-for-2-000-or-more-in-the-us-with-new-service-authenticity-guarantee-301125281.html"&gt;watches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Announcements/eBay-Launches-Authentication-Service-for-Luxury-Handbags/ba-p/27601197"&gt;handbags&lt;/a&gt; purchased on the platform. It also uses an unnamed third party to authenticate both types of items, which raises the question of whether eBay will buy out these services as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Many T-Mobile customers report they can’t call Verizon, AT&amp;T, or other T-Mobile numbers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="t-mobile and sprint logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/18z3CIQwo9-gyoN1laOQjG7pRgY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207225/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8VCvk2"&gt;T-Mobile customers have been reporting issues making and receiving calls all afternoon, with problems frequently linked to Verizon numbers. This all started around 2PM ET this afternoon, with hotspots showing in most major metro areas on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdectector&lt;/a&gt;. Initial reports suggested Verizon might be having issues, but Verizon spokesperson Kevin King tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its network is operating “business as usual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8wFwb0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;User reports indicate T-Mobile is having problems since 1:49 PM EST. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LExjRid785"&gt;https://t.co/LExjRid785&lt;/a&gt; RT if you're also having problems &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TMobiledown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TMobiledown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Downdetector (@downdetector) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/downdetector/status/1465392459878473745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

The reported problems range from instantly dropped calls, to “all circuits are busy” messages, to lag even when people are able to get a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHG3kC"&gt;A test call between one T-Mobile prepaid number and a Verizon number worked for us, but posts across social media continue to note issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDPT6G"&gt;We haven’t seen widespread reports of AT&amp;amp;T issues, other than from T-Mobile customers who are having problems calling out. T-Mobile has not responded to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>xCloud’s new Clarity Boost promises clearer streams, but it’s only on Edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3eX3A24E-olvxUiiej92S_NyjM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207213/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3Uuzu"&gt;Microsoft’s new Clarity Boost feature for Xbox Cloud Gaming (aka xCloud) is intended to make your cloud gaming streams a little bit less fuzzy, but it will only be available on the company’s Edge browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hW7QAZ"&gt;Clarity Boost “uses a set of client-side scaling improvements to improve the visual quality of the video stream,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/29/clarity-boost-with-xbox-cloud-gaming-on-edge-browser/"&gt;Microsoft’s Milena Gonzalez said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I tried Clarity Boost in a few games, and I felt that it made a noticeable difference. Games were generally less blurry, and many smaller details like leaves and bricks looked much sharper than they do with Clarity Boost off. It doesn’t &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; change the way games look, in my opinion, but if you want xCloud games to be a little more clear, I’d recommend flipping Clarity Boost on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ4QB2"&gt;Here are a few comparisons I put together to show you the differences. The first two are from &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eeEIQk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="v4IDxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893192"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GxJ7J"&gt;And here are two from &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9QQ6sH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Hfceu6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10893224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5YQyU"&gt;My colleague Tom Warren also showed off the new feature &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-bB2GSBvKM"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bwvh63"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-bB2GSBvKM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LRK5U4"&gt;If you want to see the differences for yourself on your machine, you can try Clarity Boost now by installing &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/canary"&gt;Microsoft Edge Canary&lt;/a&gt;. But if you don’t want to use a bleeding edge (pun intended) version of the browser just to try Clarity Boost, it will be available to all Edge users “by next year,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xbQUk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 29th, 6:42PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added video from Tom Warren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals happening now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d6_Kk6mAy1cA2AHUquuhncwA9zQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70204029/Cyber_Monday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uocVGt"&gt;Black Friday is technically over, but many of the same deals have carried over into Cyber Monday — plus a few new ones, of course. We’ve adapted our coverage to make sure that you’re only seeing the latest and best deals on tech that you want, and that we recommend, on wireless earbuds, TVs, games, phones, and more. The occasional Nerf blaster might find its way in here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGdVSU"&gt;If you’re hoping to get the majority of your holiday shopping done ahead of mid-December, now is a good time to do that. Though, don’t despair if something you’re looking for either isn’t available, or isn’t as cheap as you were hoping. December always brings more deals, and we’ll do our best to give you every opportunity to score on tech deals before the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQO61y"&gt;Keep a lookout for the latest deals surfacing at the top of this page. And if you don’t want the deal suggestions to stop, head over to this page to subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jeo9fv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge Cyber Monday 2021 live blog","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22807793/cyber-monday-2021-live-blog-lightning-deals-tech"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zkolIm"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="UL3Jvt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10893279"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lyTVGI"&gt;Ikea’s Symfonisk picture frame speaker is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-black-40487320%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22796651%2Fcyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Ikea for $149&lt;/a&gt;, the first significant discount we’ve seen on collaboration since it came out (discount applies at checkout). The unique speaker offers good, full sound thanks to a built-in Sonos speaker, one that’s as capable as a Sonos One. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ozFLTW"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://zendure.com/collections/bfcm/products/supertank-pro"&gt;Save 30 percent on Zendure’s SuperTank Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a 26,800mAh portable battery pack that can quickly charge devices up to 100W. Use promo code &lt;strong&gt;BFCM &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to get it for $154 (normally $220).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ftv1Jp"&gt;Apple’s midrange wearable, the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7m1QaQ"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt;, is on sale at Target in the 40mm configuration for $220 instead of $280 when you pick it up from select local stores. The Apple Watch SE serves as a step up from the Series 3, with features and a design similar to more recent flagships. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;li id="Emk278"&gt;RAVPower is taking 35 percent off several of its chargers when you use various promo codes. You can, for instance, buy this &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2Fproducts%2Frp-pc150-2-pack-20w-usb-c-pd-wall-charger%3Fvariant%3D33008876912715&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22796651%2Fcyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$28 two-pack of 20W chargers for $13&lt;/a&gt; when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;RT50&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2Fproducts%2Frp-pb232-90w-2-port-pd-3-0-qc-3-0-power-bank%3Fvariant%3D39402579558475&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22796651%2Fcyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this 90W battery bank for $58 instead of $89&lt;/a&gt; with the code &lt;strong&gt;CM35&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gKS15"&gt;
&lt;s&gt;If you want a capable 4K TV without spending a lot, check out this Amazon Lightning Deal on Vizio’s 58-inch MQ7 QLED TV. It’s $649 at other retailers, but &lt;/s&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3lmeyKZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;Amazon has it for $480&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;s&gt; for a limited time. It has HDMI 2.1 ports and VRR support, which are features typically reserved for pricier models.&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="cUK4zQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733790"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="q7Z0dX"&gt;Sony’s A8H 65-inch OLED is $1,500 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6txIXGhYS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; (originally $2,499). While it lacks some features necessary for gaming at fast refresh rates, it’s a great model if you watch a lot of movies and TV shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LpuPd6"&gt;Per &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15453814-elgato-facecam-134-99-fs?src=popular_recombee" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Elgato’s fantastic &lt;a href="https://go.corsair.com/c/482924/490888/8513?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fus%2Fen%2FCategories%2FProducts%2FElgato-Gaming%2FCameras%2FFacecam%2Fp%2F10WAA9901&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeCyberMondaydeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facecam 1080p/60 frames per second webcam&lt;/a&gt; is $135 at checkout through Corsair when you enter the code &lt;strong&gt;PSI &lt;/strong&gt;or &lt;strong&gt;VARSITY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H8c3BI"&gt;The myQ Chamberlain smart garage door controller is cheaper than ever for Cyber Monday. Around $20 was its previous best price, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GD3D9YJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has it for $17.&lt;/a&gt; This model supports &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Key-In-Garage-Delivery/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21222091011" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt;, giving drivers the ability to securely drop packages off in your garage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dO2lta"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro in the white colorway &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are $135 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($150 elsewhere in other colors).&lt;/li&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="n6jZRx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame is still available for a discount at Amazon. This is a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt;, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s webOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;50-inch&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;50-inch&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;

While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds like some other models, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook. While free is generally a good thing, just note that the model on offer here isn’t exactly premium, as it comes with just 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Long-Lasting/dp/B08BX7N9SK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon also has the Note 20 Ultra for $1,099&lt;/a&gt; though without any freebies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

If you prefer the best price outright, with no need for extras, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3tdDQLXMa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has it for just $1,400&lt;/a&gt; with activation. Normally $1,800, Samsung’s current discount makes for one of the better deals we’ve seen on the luxury foldable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While all eyes are on the new Pixel 6, we still stand by the Pixel 5A as a solid and affordable entry. Featuring one of the best cameras available in a mid-range smartphone, the 5G-compatible 5A also comes equipped with 128GB of onboard storage, IP67 water resistance, and improved battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The exact amount depends on which iPhone you choose (see below), and you can also get an additional $250 Walmart e-gift card by trading in an eligible phone. The deal runs through December 3rd, but you need to activate the new phone no later than December 3rd at 11:59PM local time to take advantage of the deal. If you prefer to get this deal and trade-in squared away in person, you need to schedule an in-person appointment. This in-store deal also ends on December 3rd.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>An introduction to Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s new CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yl0oGjIt0TgVu6CxmhCUr2owxmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70207096/acastro_211129_4896_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MDoKtA"&gt;Twitter has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;a new CEO&lt;/a&gt;: Parag Agrawal, who’ll be taking over for Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, the longest-serving chief executive in the company’s 15-plus-year history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Co67O"&gt;Agrawal isn’t the most well-known of names either inside or outside of Twitter. He’s been with the company for over a decade, though, working his way up from an engineer to become its top executive (and a close friend of Dorsey’s). Agrawal first started at Twitter back in October 2011 with a focus on ad products, and he became the first recipient of the company’s “Distinguished Engineer” title. He was later appointed chief technology officer in October 2017, during which time he’s jumped in to address high-profile problems (like a large-scale password security issue) and take on some of the company’s bolder initiatives (like decentralization). But despite that long tenure, Agrawal, who is 37, hasn’t spent much time in the public eye — something that will immediately change with his new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTRETT"&gt;That said, there are a few cues from Agrawal’s history as CTO that could indicate where Twitter might go next under his leadership. Agrawal is the fourth person to take the reins at Twitter, after Dorsey (who led the company from 2006 to 2008, and again from 2015 until now), Evan Williams (who co-founded Twitter alongside Dorsey and served as CEO from 2008 to 2010), and Dick Costolo (Twitter’s former COO, who served as CEO from 2010 through 2015). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2vicPX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Argrawal hasn’t spent much time in the public eye — until now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WnfjXe"&gt;In his time as CTO, one of Agrawal’s biggest projects has been his overseeing of the company’s decentralized Bluesky platform, which was first announced in December 2019. Intended as an “open and decentralized standard for social media” that Twitter itself could eventually transition to using, Bluesky has been one of the more dramatic ideas for Twitter’s future and a pet project of Dorsey’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kulklv"&gt;Bluesky has also been picking up steam in the past few months after a long period of radio silence: the group published its review of existing decentralized social media systems at the beginning of the year and finally put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627435/twitter-bluesky-lead-jay-graber-decentralized-social-web"&gt;cryptocurrency developer Jay Graber&lt;/a&gt; in charge of Bluesky in August after months of searching for a product lead. Presumably, Bluesky’s development — and its potential impact in replacing the underpinnings of Twitter’s platform — is something that will continue to be a major project for Agrawal as CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7HRkf"&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774501/twitter-crypto-dedicated-team-dorsey-square-decentralization"&gt;newly founded Twitter Crypto team&lt;/a&gt; led by Tess Rinearson that was announced earlier in November also reported directly to Agrawal (although it’s not clear if that will continue to be the case following his promotion). That team is also set to work closely with Bluesky, which — combined with Agrawal’s interest in decentralized Web3 platforms — speaks to a possible direction for Twitter’s future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="08JWtt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter is funding research into a decentralized version of its platform","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"},{"title":"Twitter’s decentralized social network project finally has a leader","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627435/twitter-bluesky-lead-jay-graber-decentralized-social-web"},{"title":"Twitter is launching a dedicated crypto team, part of its push toward decentralization","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774501/twitter-crypto-dedicated-team-dorsey-square-decentralization"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gaERWY"&gt;That experience with Bluesky could gel nicely with another of Agrawal’s biggest projects as Twitter’s chief technology officer: the years-long effort to try and move some of Twitter’s products off its own servers to more robust cloud services from companies like Amazon and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIX1id"&gt;Agrawal spearheaded the effort to advance Twitter’s internal technology back in 2018 in an effort to try and help speed up the pace of feature development and deployment, as noted in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/twitter-cto-we-need-to-do-better"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “When we hear people say that Twitter is slow at shipping, that hurts, and that is something we use as motivation,” Agrawal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvKtbk"&gt;That’s led to changes like &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2018/a-new-collaboration-with-google-cloud"&gt;Twitter’s partnership with Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt; for processing data in May 2018 and the ongoing effort to slowly switch over the Twitter timeline feature itself to Amazon Web Services (which is expected to be complete in 2023). “I do think people are starting to recognize now externally that we are going faster. And it feels good because it’s like a bunch of work from the past starting to pay off,” Agrawal noted in the interview. “But we’re nowhere close to done. I think we have a lot of opportunity to go even faster and [in] even more noticeable ways in the coming years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Y4d3"&gt;Other Agrawal projects were more reactionary fixes to existing Twitter problems, albeit significant ones: in his time as CTO, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2020/transparency-image-cropping.html"&gt;Agrawal was a part of the effort&lt;/a&gt; last year to address &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;Twitter’s problematic racial cropping issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;with photo previews&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html"&gt;handling the public explanation&lt;/a&gt; for the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17316684/twitter-password-bug-security-flaw-exposed-change-now"&gt;2018 password bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlAGKu"&gt;Agrawal has also hinted at how he’ll address one of Twitter’s biggest challenges: moderation. In a 2020 interview with &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/18/1012066/emtech-stage-twitters-cto-on-misinformation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Agrawal said that Twitter’s role is to build a healthy place for conversing online, suggesting that could come at the expense of allowing people to say whatever they want. “Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAHubZ"&gt;That doesn’t mean moderating all misinformation, though. Agrawal views Twitter’s goal as avoiding the “specific harm that misleading information can cause” rather than “trying to be an arbiter of what is true or false on the internet.” That’s because, as Agrawal puts it, “defining misinformation is really, really hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5wHM6R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Decentralization, moderation, and more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WM6YZG"&gt;That stance may continue to lead to issues with Republican politicians, many of whom are already opposed to Twitter’s moderation policies and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;ban of former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1465365574297559045?s=20"&gt;House Judiciary GOP Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; already referred to Twitter’s new CEO as “much worse” than Dorsey after latching onto an out-of-context tweet from Agrawal from 2010 (before he was employed at Twitter) quoting a comedic segment from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;’s Aasif Mandvi &lt;a href="https://www.cc.com/video/vz5edd/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-npr-staffing-decision-2010"&gt;about stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260269/anti-conservative-bias-social-media-no-evidence-nyu-research"&gt;Repeated reports&lt;/a&gt; have shown that social media platforms like Twitter have no empirical proof of bias against conservative content, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740703/twitter-algorithm-right-wing-amplification-study"&gt;recent study from Twitter itself&lt;/a&gt; found that the platform’s algorithms actually favored right-wing views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMH2G7"&gt;It’s one of many hurdles Agrawal will have to overcome. While he inherits a company that has been growing its daily user figures and rolling out products at a speedier-than-ever clip, Twitter still faces ongoing issues with user growth at home, ad products stymied by recent privacy changes, and faster-growing social networks like Snapchat. Agrawal may not be the most publicly recognizable candidate for running Twitter, but his years of experience with the company, deep experience with Twitter’s product, and past work in helping modernize Twitter’s tech stack makes him an interesting choice for CEO, especially as decentralized blockchain technology becomes more prominent. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Four more gaming PCs you might actually buy for an RTX 3080 Ti, 3070 Ti, or 3060 Ti on Cyber Monday</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qu2MSWZedcRAFbdd6-SRyF38Eck=/13x0:2040x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70206808/twarren_20210601_4611_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJ42jA"&gt;On Black Friday, I introduced you to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/26/22803778/black-friday-gaming-pc-prebuilt-sales-deals-rtx-3080-3070-3060"&gt;an extremely curated selection of gaming PCs&lt;/a&gt; that might actually be good value for the money and deliver serious GPU oomph at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;those GPUs are incredibly expensive&lt;/a&gt; and hard to find. Let’s do it again for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796651/cyber-monday-2021-best-deals-sales-tech-gadgets-laptops-phones-tvs-headphones-gaming"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="92RXuf"&gt;RTX 3080 Ti — $2,400&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KPbk2o"&gt;If you’re looking for Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;top gaming card&lt;/a&gt; — because while the RTX 3090 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt;, it’s overkill — HP’s Omen 30L is perhaps the best all-around prebuilt deal. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBFCM2021breakout&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fomen-30l-desktop-gt13-1365xt-bundle-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;There’s one specific system you can nab for $2,399&lt;/a&gt; with the powerful 4K graphics card and a powerful Core i7-11700K chip, and it doesn’t skimp on the memory or storage this time around: you get 32GB of RAM, a 512GB solid-state drive, and a 2TB hard drive, all powered by an 800W Gold PSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSsMFs"&gt;Sadly, HP’s coupon code doesn’t work on this rig, but again, this GPU is fetching an average of $1,941 on eBay all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5LOdzME-__qb63Y0kbLY0V_waHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23045001/omen_30_l.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Omen 30L. The 25L is similar but smaller and without the front lit-up fan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ps7wYg"&gt;RTX 3080 — $1,800&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="g2sUSb"&gt;Or, for $600 less, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBFCM2021breakout&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FlangId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catalogId%3D10051%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619771820%26" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you could nab a $1,799 HP Omen 30L with an RTX 3080 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; and the exceedingly similar but slightly slower Core i7-10700K and tell yourself you’ll upgrade its paltry 8GB / 256GB of RAM and storage to something better later. (Looking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;our 3080 Ti vs. 3080 benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;, that’s what I’d probably pick.) Not quite as good as HP’s $1,611 RTX 3080 deal from Black Friday, but not bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgMECT"&gt;To get the $1,799 price, enter coupon code &lt;strong&gt;HOLIDAY10&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FWB0g4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with  free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="jquBRb"&gt;RTX 3070 Ti — $1,799&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Uypvsb"&gt;I’m still keeping &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnzxt.com%2Fproduct%2Fstreaming-plus-pc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F29%2F22808536%2Fcyber-monday-gaming-pc-prebuilt-sales-deals-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NZXT’s $1,799 Streaming Plus PC&lt;/a&gt; in here for now for its RTX 3070 Ti. You get AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of solid-state storage in an attractive design. It’s also got a 750W Gold-certified power supply and a two-year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="877Zpo"&gt;Again, no coupon code; you’ll see the $1,799 price at checkout and no sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yFEQ8zSkMfAQEcYQXp5pSOhE_Wo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23044995/1627490831_streamerpc2_white_2000x2000_hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NZXT’s PC comes prebuilt in the company’s own Kraken M22 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g9Vm23"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti — $1,188&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m4Jeu8"&gt;With no more competition from Alienware, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBFCM2021breakout&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619940318%26quantity%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,188 for an HP Omen 25L&lt;/a&gt; is definitely my pick for the 3060 Ti, with an AMD Ryzen 5600X, RTX 3060 Ti, a 600W PSU, and the same 8GB / 256GB RAM and storage as it had on Black Friday. Like the HPs we discussed on Friday, you’ll need to manually select that graphics card and enter &lt;strong&gt;HOLIDAY10&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout to get the full price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkd0LI"&gt;You can also use the configurator to get a 3070 Ti at that same link for $1,710 after coupon code, but I’d just pick the NZXT or 3080-equipped HP for that much money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GV3tze"&gt;You’ll find plenty of other Cyber Monday PC deals if you look, too, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6wCZkvq7v" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like this one RTX 3070-equipped Asus desktop for $1,600 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven’t seen any others I can easily recommend. If you ask me, the performance of a 3070 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;too close to a 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt; to justify the premium over HP’s deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZFZLm3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cd4MZk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon must redo Bessemer union election, orders labor board official</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-POLITICS-LABOR-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFpwf7C6fUIkoa-RkjYeOIg6yAo=/0x0:5154x3436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70206605/1232001976.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bau3LK"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has ordered a new election at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama site, a tentative victory for organizers who had sought to unionize workers at the company’s fulfillment locations. &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21119381-rd-supplemental-decisions"&gt;The decision&lt;/a&gt;, issued by the regional director overseeing the case, builds on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;previous recommendation&lt;/a&gt; from the hearing officer assigned to the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrWr1D"&gt;“I agree with the hearing officer’s recommendations,” Monday’s decision reads. “Accordingly, I affirm the hearing officer’s rulings, I adopt her recommendation to sustain certain objections, and I order a second election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Kjrhtr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I order a second election”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZl0mW"&gt;The decision does not name a date for the second election, which will be set in a future filing. But Amazon can also request a review of the decision from the full NLRB board, which (if granted) could prevent the election from taking place or invalidate its results after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlPKJA"&gt;Reached for comment, Amazon emphasized recent improvements in pay and safety for workers in its fulfillment centers. “Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU earlier this year,” said Amazon representative Kelly Nantel. “It’s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn’t count.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="banCNd"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which organized the drive that culminated in the February election, hailed the decision as a victory. “Today’s decision confirms what we were saying all along,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum,&lt;strong&gt; “&lt;/strong&gt;that Amazon’s intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BejEs"&gt;Announced in April, the election result delivered an overwhelming defeat for the RWDSU, with workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;voting 1,798 to 738 against unionization&lt;/a&gt;. But that result was contested by RWDSU officials, who argue Amazon interfered with the election by — among other things — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;installing its own mailbox to collect ballots&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon security guards had access to the mailbox, giving some workers the impression that Amazon controlled the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DXWad"&gt;In the months since, a number of other unions have expressed interest in organizing Amazon workers, and a second election at the site might face significantly more interest from other labor groups.

    <title>Amazon and Target play ‘outsized’ role in port congestion and pollution, report finds</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wLIxgA"&gt;Amazon and Target are playing a big role in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;port pollution crisis&lt;/a&gt; along the US West Coast, according to a &lt;a href="https://shipitzero.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FINAL-Ship-it-Zero-Campaign-Report.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published today. These retail giants are among the top importers in the US and rely heavily on shipping routes between China and California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY4hv9"&gt;Communities near the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles have some of the &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities"&gt;worst air quality&lt;/a&gt; in the nation thanks in large part to Americans’ shopping habits. Online shopping, which increased during the pandemic, has made the situation worse. So has the supply chain crisis that’s caused traffic jams just offshore of the twin ports, which make up the busiest port complex in the Western Hemisphere.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NCWyYa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is past time to hold these retailers accountable for their responsibilities at the ports.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRodX7"&gt;Amazon and Target have an “outsized” impact on port congestion and pollution because they send most of their goods through these ports. The two companies “are directly responsible for harming these communities,” says the report by nonprofit environmental groups Pacific Environment and Stand.earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfvmpf"&gt;“It is past time to hold these retailers accountable for their responsibilities at the ports,” Dawny’all Heydari, a campaign lead at Pacific Environment, said in a statement. “Both companies will continue to favor West Coast routes, which means they’ll also keep clogging West Coast ports, spewing cancer-causing emissions and threatening our climate future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9U6W3"&gt;The report looked at ship emissions from four major retailers: Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Ikea. Together, the four retail giants’ imports were responsible for 20 million metric tons of  carbon dioxide, equivalent to emissions from marine shipping alone between 2018 and 2020. That’s about as much planet-heating pollution as five coal-fired power plants would produce in a year. The report gathered information about shipments from the US vessel manifest data and used emissions estimates from the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Commerce&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZH8q5"&gt;Although the report focused on the climate impact of retailers’ shipping emissions, the heavy fuel oil that container ships burn also releases pollutants that form smog and degrade air quality. Pollution from maritime shipping was linked to 60,000 premature deaths in 2015 internationally according to earlier &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/blog/staff/silent-deadly-case-shipping-emissions"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;. Since about &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/ocean/topics/ocean-shipping/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of world trade moves by ship, nearly all the items we buy — whether they’re clothes, gadgets, home goods, or cars — are part of the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hu3ABf"&gt;The biggest share of emissions studied in the new report — 21 percent of pollution between 2018 and 2020 — was released along shipping routes between China and either Southern California or Washington state. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach typically take in about 40 percent of shipping containers entering the country from abroad. The pandemic has made these ports — and others — even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;more congested&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5g5Y1"&gt;Amazon and Target’s fingerprints are all over the crowded scenes at California ports, according to the report, because that’s where the companies sent the vast majority of their US imports. Amazon has built out a network of &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/san-bernardino-county-california-air-pollution-logistics-industry/"&gt;distribution centers&lt;/a&gt; in Southern California, where workers sort goods after they come off ships before sending them off to their final destinations. The Golden State is where Target sees the highest sales per capita, which the report posits could be another motivating factor for cramming goods through California ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="E4Ps0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Walmart, the biggest importer in the report, had the most emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dvfbJw"&gt;Walmart, the biggest importer in the report, had the most emissions of the four companies studied. But its pollution was more spread out across ports along the East and West Coasts and Gulf of Mexico. Ikea has started sending more stuff to the East Coast, the report found. Its maritime shipping emissions actually fell slightly because the company is moving goods by rail from China to Europe before sending them across the Atlantic to the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf8fpV"&gt;The new research follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584335/ikea-amazon-walmart-shipping-emissions-climate-change"&gt;July report&lt;/a&gt; by the same groups that ranked the 15 retail companies responsible for the most marine shipping pollution from imports into the US. In that earlier report, Walmart also topped the list for greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, including soot, sulfur oxide, and nitrous oxide. Target, Ikea, and Amazon were also among the top ten maritime polluters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5feLM"&gt;Amazon, Target, Ikea, and Walmart likely rely on just a small group of carriers to ferry their goods across the world, according to the new report. The 15 biggest cargo carriers in the world accounted for 97 percent of all emissions analyzed in the report. That, the report authors argue, means that the retail companies could hold a lot of sway over carriers’ transitions to cleaner-burning fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MQ2sEV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Retail companies could hold a lot of sway over carriers’ transitions to cleaner-burning fuels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BYFB5o"&gt;Following Pacific Environment and Stand.earth’s earlier report on the climate impact of marine shipping, there’s already some movement in that direction. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/first-movers-coalition/sectors"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month to ship 10 percent of goods shipped internationally on carbon pollution-free ships by the end of the decade. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736701/amazon-ikea-shipping-pollution-major-retailers"&gt;In October&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon and Ikea were among a group of companies that committed to only contract ships running on zero-carbon fuels by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zID0V5"&gt;The authors of the new report want the retail giants to move much faster. They’re calling on all four companies to eliminate their maritime emissions by 2030 by switching to zero-emission container ships, which do not yet exist at scale but are &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/us-joins-norway-denmark-advance-zero-emissions-ship-fuels-2021-06-11/#:~:text=LONDON%2C%20June%2011%20(Reuters),the%20industry%2C%20officials%20involved%20said"&gt;being developed&lt;/a&gt; through public and private sector initiatives. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to all four retailers for comment, and only received responses from Amazon and Ikea that pointed to the companies’ previous environmental sustainability commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3kUjx"&gt;The speed of that transition affects how quickly the world teeters closer to catastrophic levels of climate change. It also affects the health of people living near ports. The uptick in ship traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach this year alone has been so bad that it could lead to an additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22800410/black-friday-holiday-shopping-supply-chain-pollution-ports-warehouses-california"&gt;30 premature deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the region, according to the regulatory agency California Air Resources Board (CARB).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s time to study the health impacts of TikTok, researchers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lBNrTvQZnTdQ6Wy5YLyULaw0Ohc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70206579/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PynRZe"&gt;People have flocked to TikTok in droves over the past few years — but research into the social media giant’s potential health impacts hasn’t kept up. Despite the fact that TikTok now has over &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2021/09/27/tiktok-reaches-1-billion-users-worldwide-growth-surges/5886506001/"&gt;1 billion&lt;/a&gt; users, public health researchers know very little about the health effects it might be having on the platform’s (mostly young) users. That’s concerning, because researchers know social media platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22749357/facebook-mental-health-research-tobacco"&gt;can be harmful&lt;/a&gt;, especially to the health of some groups of teens and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hnAiq"&gt;“The platform is so massive, but there’s almost no scholarly investigation into it,” says Marco Zenone, a health policy researcher at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9clhr"&gt;Zenone believes it’s urgent for researchers to start figuring out if TikTok has similar issues to other platforms, like eroding the mental health of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"&gt;some teen girls&lt;/a&gt; and failing to slow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21254184/how-plandemic-went-viral-facebook-youtube"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why, along with collaborators, earlier this month he published a &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/6/11/e007648.full.pdf"&gt;proposed research agenda&lt;/a&gt; outlining the areas experts need to investigate. They include the way alcohol use and vaping are presented on the platform, the medical advice given by users — made more urgent in light of COVID-19 misinformation — and moderation policies. They’re also worried about what happens to users when videos sharing personal, sensitive stories go viral, and if the platform has similar impacts on teen mental health as Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2vDxN"&gt;“The research is very behind, considering how much reach TikTok has,” Zenone says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlE57j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Zenone about his proposed agenda and why research into TikTok’s health effects matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYidJ6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDJJJy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why don’t we know much about TikTok’s health impacts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87SqYq"&gt;I think it rose to prominence so quickly, and research hasn’t been able to catch up. So right now we know that TikTok has 1 billion users, and we see a lot of the research coming out is still on Facebook, Instagram, and related platforms but hasn’t shifted in TikTok yet. That’s kind of concerned us as public health researchers because we’ve seen what happened in the past when it’s left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fy5gqj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you end up identifying as the important areas to study, and why are they so key?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1J6DO"&gt;Some of the things that we’ve flagged are just some of the issues that we’ve dealt with on other social media platforms, and have been documented issues on other platforms, but that we haven’t looked at yet on TikTok. So, for example, the promotion of health-harming products — products like Juul spread on Instagram spread faster than health researchers could study how the conversation was expanding. That’s one reason we need to be proactive with this kind of research and document what’s happening around the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOLWM5"&gt;A lot of people also give health advice on the platform, but we don’t really know the quality of the health advice. What research is available tells us that when someone has a credential to speak on a topic, they’re usually accurate. But if you introduce a conflict of interest, like someone selling a product, the quality goes down. And that can be concerning depending on how someone is using that health information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scHhaM"&gt;We also know misinformation is a problem on social media, but we don’t know the extent of it on TikTok. We also need to look into the dissemination of hateful or sensitive content on TikTok. With a billion users, we have to ask how good its moderation actually is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCfXkc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are these questions similar to the ones we ask around other social media platforms, or is there something unique about TikTok here? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FblfHz"&gt;The main difference I see is that TikTok really has the opportunity to learn from Facebook, Instagram, and other social media platforms. The shortcomings have been documented. So the big thing is the newness. Social media usually faces the same problems across platforms, even if on different scales. That’s one of the reasons we need to do the research and see what’s happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ialXKq"&gt;The user base of TikTok is also a bit different. There are a lot of young people on the platform, and I think we have to keep that in mind as we do research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDadkI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is understanding TikTok so important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHGbMt"&gt;Our view is that TikTok is going to be here for quite a while. And we know that the majority of people who use it are younger people. So it’s just about making TikTok as safe as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNd40B"&gt;I believe that we have to keep TikTok accountable. And one of the ways that we can do that is making sure that we’re keeping up to date with what’s happening on the platform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PijwAC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx8QCW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GOG is losing money and refocusing on ‘handpicked selection of games’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="gog galaxy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L31lFf1kZ0po6o4YDLG0BGx4PCY=/114x0:1322x805/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70206531/gog_galaxy.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7xv0oL"&gt;CD Projekt says its GOG games storefront will put more focus on offering “a handpicked selection of games” and transfer some developers to other projects, following ongoing financial losses at the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8a5oU6"&gt;“Regarding GOG, its performance does present a challenge, and recently we’ve taken measures to improve its financial standing,” CD Projekt CFO Piotr Nielubowicz told investors on a quarterly earnings call. “First and foremost, we’ve decided that GOG should focus more on its core business activity, which means offering a handpicked selection of games with its unique DRM-free philosophy. In line with this approach, there will be changes in the team structure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HxAjJR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“GOG should focus more on its core business activity, which means offering a handpicked selection of games”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yoVFEP"&gt;Nielubowicz said that some developers who’d been working on GOG’s online solutions will be transferred from the project. At the end of 2021, GOG is also leaving the Gwent consortium, a cross-division project related to CD Projekt’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; card game &lt;em&gt;Gwent&lt;/em&gt;. This means it won’t bear any development costs or share any profits from the development consortium. CD Projekt previously called &lt;em&gt;Gwent &lt;/em&gt;“the most important project of 2017 in the GOG.com segment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVKM7f"&gt;These latest statements came after &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-29-cd-projekt-sales-up-but-gog-struggles"&gt;disappointing financial results&lt;/a&gt; for GOG. The storefront saw a slight increase in revenue but a net loss of around $1.14 million in the last financial quarter. Overall, it’s lost about $2.21 million over the past three quarters compared to a $1.37 million profit over the same period in 2020. CD Projekt didn’t immediately reply to questions about how its new strategy might translate into changes to GOG’s features or catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rCAzr"&gt;GOG launched in 2008 as Good Old Games, a platform built around selling hard-to-find classic games without digital rights management or DRM. Since then, it’s expanded into a more all-purpose storefront selling new third-party games and internal studio CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, plus an online service called GOG Galaxy&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But it’s also faced apparent financial problems before, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/facing-financial-pressures-gog-quietly-lays-off-at-lea-1832879826"&gt;laying off a reported 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; of its staff in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11ynTo"&gt;One staff member tied the earlier layoffs to increased competition in PC gaming storefronts, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120577/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition"&gt;driven major platforms&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;lower the commission&lt;/a&gt; they take from developers. Valve’s Steam service has long dominated the market for computer game sales. At least one recent competitor, the Epic Games Store, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-05-04-epic-expects-epic-games-store-to-be-profitable-by-2024"&gt;isn’t expected to turn a profit&lt;/a&gt; until 2024. And Epic’s store is cushioned by revenue from the publisher’s blockbuster game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Unreal game engine. Meanwhile, CD Projekt Red’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;botched 2020 launch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;has put a damper on its recent earnings — although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808038/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-next-gen-update-release-date"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it has seen renewed enthusiasm for the game and is “on track” to release a delayed update in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
