    <title>How to watch Apple’s October ‘Unleashed’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Eg02fla5QNjKwnijgsV-r_Q5uk=/0x96:1088x821/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009811/apple_unleashed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5tZSlE"&gt;Apple is hosting its next big hardware event at 10AM PT / 1PM ET. The event is titled “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810"&gt;Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;,” and while we’re not totally sure what Apple will be unleashing, the dotted-font design on the invitation could be a hint at the higher-res &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590004/macbook-air-mini-led-display-apple-silicon-2022-redesign"&gt;miniLED displays&lt;/a&gt; expected for new MacBook Pros. These new, more powerful MacBook Pros will probably come in 14- and 16-inch screen sizes, and, may have SD readers and HDMI and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt; ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1FC9o"&gt;And possibly (finally) Apple may release new AirPods as well.  It also seems likely we’ll get a release date for macOS Monterey, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;which was announced&lt;/a&gt; at the same time as iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, but remains in beta. The rumor mill also has been predicting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;end of the Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR1IjE"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE APPLE “UNLEASHED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET on Monday, October 18th. If you miss the live stream, it’s likely you’ll be able to catch a replay after the event wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH IT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;Apple is hosting the stream on its &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and it is also streaming it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exM1uajp--A&amp;amp;ab_channel=Apple"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. The YouTube stream is embedded above for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Harry Potter smartwatch cashes in on millennial nostalgia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/us6_RqRLg9BWDCw7aB1SrPPGb4A=/0x0:1794x1196/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009801/m_bgc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AxLGmg"&gt;How much do you still like Harry Potter? Enough to put up with a device that our own Dan Siefert called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;basic and borin&lt;/a&gt;g” and which &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;’s Victoria Song called “&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-worst-smartwatch-ive-ever-used-1846652533"&gt;the worst smartwatch I’ve ever used”&lt;/a&gt;? Well boy do I have a limited edition tie-in for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cps0XJ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Foneplus-watch-harry-potter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22732353%2Foneplus-harry-potter-limited-edition-smartwatch-watch-faces" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Watch Harry Potter Limited Edition&lt;/a&gt; is a new version of the company’s disappointing debut smartwatch themed around the boy wizard. It’s currently listed for ₹16,999 (around $225), and will be available exclusively in India where it releases on October 21st. That’s a small premium over the ₹14,999 (around $200) the regular version of the watch retails for in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7z7R_mnKc2Wbl9PRdA4xNs9goo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935324/watch_rotate_360.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch includes custom faces and a Harry Potter-themed design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NVTFw9"&gt;The limited edition version of the watch naturally includes a number of Harry Potter-themed elements. It has a copper color scheme and a brown leather band adorned with Harry Potter branding, and it comes in a box themed around the magical entryway to Diagon Alley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJJWQi"&gt;Software tweaks include six themed watch faces, including four based around the Hogwarts school houses, as well as special boot and charging animations. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-watch-harry-potter-edition/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; gotten its hands on the watch if you’d like to read some first-hand impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDRm1l"&gt;Despite its disappointing initial reviews, OnePlus has been updating the watch since its release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422707/oneplus-watch-always-on-display-update-battery-life"&gt;adding new features like&lt;/a&gt; an always-on display and remote control camera function. But based on Dan’s experience with the smartwatch, it might need a lot more than a wizarding-themed coat of paint to turn it into a must-have accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKo0j1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IdRDQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s Bluetooth speaker with Spotify Tap is also a lamp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Blqp-t159_HajrcT-LKfLGreiAc=/18x0:1653x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009676/1_5_sec.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea’s Vappeby is one of the first Bluetooth speakers with a dedicated Spotify Tap button.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfZw0W"&gt;Ikea’s Vappeby Bluetooth speaker just leaked courtesy of an &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/FHO-E2004"&gt;FCC filing&lt;/a&gt;. And because it’s Ikea, this mushroom-shaped speaker with an IP65 rating — which means it’ll resist dust, rain, and low pressure jets of water — also features an integrated 20 lumen (2700K) bulb to pull double-duty as a portable lamp. But that’s not the only surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrbjfn"&gt;The Vappeby speaker also has a Spotify Tap button, in what would appear to be a first for Bluetooth speakers. Spotify Tap lets you resume your music from wherever you last stopped, or tap the button again to get a different recommendation tailored for you. Spotify Tap is already available on &lt;a href="https://explore.spotify.com/us/pages/spotify-tap"&gt;a range of Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt; from Samsung, Microsoft, Bose, Jabra, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_UzWvu9b33rmbtTHqKxS1stMdQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935288/Pasted_Graphic_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Laptop for scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4mytxEe6Pg5nV_ZPR_bMHoRZio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935289/Pasted_Graphic_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let there be light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wMUtAS"&gt;The diminutive speaker that seems ideally suited for use in the garden or patio also has a USB-C port for charging, and a battery that Ikea says will last for up to 13 hours when set at 50 percent volume and brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wB7vYq"&gt;Note: the Vappeby isn’t part of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22724889/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-speaker-lamp-2021-review-specs"&gt;Symfonisk range&lt;/a&gt; of Sonos-developed speakers. It’ll sit next to Ikea’s other Bluetooth speakers which currently start at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Feneby-portable-bluetooth-speaker-black-20401407%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22732334%2Fikea-bluetooth-speaker-lamp-vappeby-outdoor-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99&lt;/a&gt; and go up to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Feneby-bluetooth-speaker-black-gen-2-40492425%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F18%2F22732334%2Fikea-bluetooth-speaker-lamp-vappeby-outdoor-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no price or date for this portable, all-weather speaker, but it shouldn’t be long before it hits retail channels now that it’s cleared the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK schools are using facial recognition to take pupils’ lunch money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facial Recognition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vZ5e23-ewOCItEvkj2nILzecKYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009630/jbareham_170417_1617_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NVWEFs"&gt;A group of nine schools in the UK have started using facial recognition to verify children’s payments for school meals. The schools in North Ayrshire in Scotland claim that using the technology is faster and more hygienic than taking payments using cards or fingerprint scanners, but privacy advocates warn that the move is normalizing biometric surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UC4My7"&gt;“With Facial Recognition, pupils simply select their meal, look at the camera and go, making for a faster lunch service whilst removing any contact at the point of sale,” reads a flyer &lt;a href="https://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/Documents/EducationalServices/facial-recognition-parental-flyer.pdf"&gt;distributed to parents&lt;/a&gt; by the schools. An &lt;a href="https://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/Documents/EducationalServices/facial-recognition-faqs.pdf"&gt;FAQ sheet&lt;/a&gt; says that children’s biometric data is stored in an encrypted form and deleted when a child leaves the school. Parents have to opt-in for children to use the technology, and can alternatively use PIN to verify payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k5n1aj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parents have to opt-in to use the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2NSWqR"&gt;David Swanston, managing director of CRB Cunninghams, the firm responsible for installing the technology, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/af08fe55-39f3-4894-9b2f-4115732395b9"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that facial recognition cut payment time per pupil to five seconds on average. Swanston said pilots of the system had begun in 2020, and that 65 more schools were signed up to introduce the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkr7zH"&gt;As reported by the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, North Ayrshire council claims that 97 percent of children or parents consented to be enrolled. But some parents said they were not sure if children fully understood what they were signing up for, and were influenced by peer pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFCfuqBSjU-5VhO1mJYwu3VYvBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935274/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_9.49.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: North Ayrshire council&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaflet explaining the technology was distributed to parents ahead of the enrollment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qclLnV"&gt;Facial recognition systems of various types are becoming more common throughout the world. Schools in the United States have been installing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/20/21028124/schools-facial-recognition-mass-shootings"&gt;such systems for years&lt;/a&gt;, though usually as a security measure. Last week, Moscow &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system"&gt;introduced facial recognition payments&lt;/a&gt; in its metro system, with activists warning that the technology could be used to track and identify protestors. Various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557516/maine-facial-recognition-ban-state-law"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; in the US have banned facial recognition, arguing that the technology is frequently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;biased&lt;/a&gt; across racial or gender lines. In the European Union, too, politicians and advocacy groups are &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-ban-facial-recognition-brussels/"&gt;calling for a ban on the technology&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the downsides of its introduction outweigh potential benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMJcCg"&gt;Silkie Carlo of the UK campaign group Big Brother Watch told the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; that the Ayrshire school scheme was unnecessary. “It’s normalising biometric identity checks for something that is mundane,” said Carlo. “You don’t need to resort to airport style [technology] for children getting their lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 might start at a relatively affordable $599</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s1StdY"&gt;The Pixel 6’s price could start at $599 with 128GB of storage, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro could start at $898, according to early US pricing at Target stores spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1449909532939804678"&gt;M. Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EvanLei1/status/1449875442953949184"&gt;Evan Lei&lt;/a&gt;. Lei posted a photo of pricing already displayed on Target’s shelves, while Lee has images of the retailer’s inventory system showing the same prices. A “street date” for both phones (aka their release dates) is listed as October 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfvImM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayOD9qDsSq0"&gt;Lee has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the European starting prices of the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro will be €649 and €899 respectively, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1449810859807608836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1449810859807608836%7Ctwgr%5Ehb_2_7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2021%2F10%2F17%2Fpixel-6-us-price%2F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has discovered Amazon UK listings that show the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro priced at £849, with a shipping date of November 1st. The Pixel 6 Pro with 256GB of storage could cost £100 more at £949.&lt;/p&gt;

Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1449909532939804678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6h2Dhq"&gt;If accurate, these prices are much more affordable than what we expected after Google said it was making an “ultra high end” smartphone in August. Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh even said that the new phone would “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;certainly be a premium-priced product&lt;/a&gt;,” which suggested pricing of over $1,000. Instead, these starting prices are cheaper than the midrange &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; that debuted for $699 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqI3wS"&gt;Google is poised to announce its latest smartphones at an event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;taking place on Tuesday at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones will be Google’s first to run its own Tensor processor, and could support face-unlock, up to 23W wireless fast charging via a new Pixel Stand, and come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;five years of Android security updates&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a closer look at the phones ahead of their official launch, plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729135/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-photos-images-renders-evan-blass"&gt;images of the handset have leaked&lt;/a&gt; showing every aspect of their design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Beatles: Get Back, Narcos: Mexico, The Batman, Hawkeye, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaoHt7O247YY9ceXTJ8Q83tHDPc=/170x0:1216x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70008384/the_beatles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beatles prepare for their final live show, part of a “new” documentary from Disney. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auta2lagtw4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WaltDisneyStudios" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mIbAHx"&gt;Happy &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; day to all of us who are celebrating, the show returns tonight and I look forward to being welcomed back by the dissonant piano chords of its theme song and the utter lunacy of the Roy family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HACFgn"&gt;Yesterday at DC FanDome we got to see a slew of new trailers for games, TV shows, and movies; the biggest of course was the latest trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt; teaser&lt;/a&gt; a close second. Plenty of non-superhero trailers this week as well, including a new teaser for &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;, a new season for &lt;em&gt;Narcos: Mexico, &lt;/em&gt;another peek at &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye, &lt;/em&gt;a time-traveling flick with a corny name, and a look at the “new” Beatles documentary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EIbzSf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Auta2lagtw4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5fL6tb"&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xRCAql"&gt;As the story goes, a film crew got access to document The Beatles at work in 1969, but the footage has been locked in a vault until now, and has been restored by filmmaker Peter Jackson (with the blessing of the surviving Beatles and their families). The group had three weeks to write and record a new album and it’s really fascinating to see the four of them work through what were half-written songs then, that we now know well, and argue over whether to do a live show. And as usual, Paul McCartney looks unbelievably young. It’s really poignant when you realize the film is leading up to what will be their last live performance, on a London rooftop. &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back, &lt;/em&gt;directed by Peter Jackson&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will roll out over three days —November 25th, 26th, and 27th— on Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w2d71w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyXUaNhqpqE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="V9A1Pw"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yn8SKY"&gt;This second look at the Marvel/Disney series is really leaning in to the whole “this is a Christmas show” bit. Clint Barton/Hawkeye and the family head to New York to see a show: “Rogers, The Musical,” according to the marquee (we get a glimpse of Thor and Captain America on stage with a puzzled Clint in the audience). A one-minute teaser set to Andy Williams’ &lt;em&gt;Most Wonderful Time of the Year&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t tell us a whole lot more about the show, which is a little disappointing.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld, Vera Farmiga, and Florence Pugh star in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mSUvLo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqqft2x_Aa4?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=13&amp;amp;start=13" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6fn0wM"&gt;The Batman &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cFfyns"&gt;The second trailer for the Matt Reeves/Robert Pattinson version of the Dark Knight dropped during FanDome and it’s very moody and grim and has cool explosions and gunfire effects and rain, but I wished we could have seen a tiny bit more of Paul Dano’s serial killer Riddler (a far cry from the beloved but campy Frank Gorshin version). Colin Farrell is completely unrecognizable as the Penguin, and Zoe Kravitz is a mysterious, flirty Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Also I’m a little obsessed with the question mark in the Riddler’s latte (I realize it’s probably the work of an FX artist and not a barista, but still). After what feels like several hundred pandemic-related delays, &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; will arrive in theaters March 4th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F7yw0f"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlnLus7iqkI?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=20&amp;amp;start=20" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8v9wdu"&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gXya3A"&gt;I need more, Apple, these short teasers are just not sufficient. “Whence is that knocking?!” asks Denzel Washington’s Macbeth. Just you wait, mister, shit is about to get &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Oh hi, Frances McDormand looking totally innocent as Lady Macbeth (ha not really). Directed by Joel Coen, &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters December 25th and on Apple Plus TV on January 14th. Hopefully we get a longer trailer between now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6scBQ1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhZBDO0CKJo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="63W3W4"&gt;Narcos: Mexico &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zGmkb3"&gt;This is reportedly the final season for this excellent series about drug cartels, the third in the Mexico series and the sixth for the entire &lt;em&gt;Narcos&lt;/em&gt; franchise (multiverse?). A new generation of cartel leaders are battling for power; throw in some truth-seeking journalists and ethically flexible government agents, and you got yourself a show. &lt;em&gt;Narcos: Mexico&lt;/em&gt; returns to Netflix for season three on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BAMlIZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OODneEUWUQY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rR7vFs"&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3hYYMZ"&gt;To my surprise, John Cena is delightful in this teaser for&lt;em&gt; Peacemaker, &lt;/em&gt;a series spun off from&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad. &lt;/em&gt;The series takes place after the events of the movie and gives some insight into Peacemaker’s origins. It looks goofy and fun, and all eight episodes of this first season were written by &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;director James Gunn, obviously a huge plus. Cena stars along with Steve Agee, Danielle Brooks, Robert Patrick, Jennifer Holland, Freddie Stroma, and Chukwudi Iwuji in Peacemaker, which debuts on HBO Max January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ciyHpa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VfPClAsIpg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="41IMqv"&gt;Needle in a Timestack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MMPkyj"&gt;A movie with stars this talented should have a better name. But &lt;em&gt;Needle in a Timestack &lt;/em&gt;is based on the 1966 short story of the same name by Robert Silverberg, so we just gotta live with that title. The trailer itself looks not terrible: A blissfully happy married couple have their lives disrupted when her jealous ex goes back in time to change their lives so that the couple never meets. Leslie Odom, Jr., Cynthia Erivo, Freida Pinto, and Orlando Bloom star in &lt;em&gt;Needle in a Timestack,&lt;/em&gt; which is in select theaters now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook disputes report that its AI can’t detect hate speech or violence consistently</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8QWfLq9FMdhLLc4isYNzTH1fMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70007498/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is disputing a report that says its artificial intelligence isn’t effective at detecting hate speech. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HPtpoM"&gt;Facebook vice president of integrity Guy Rosen &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/hate-speech-prevalence-dropped-facebook/"&gt;wrote in blog post&lt;/a&gt; Sunday that the prevalence of hate speech on the platform had dropped by 50 percent over the past three years, and that “a narrative that the technology we use to fight hate speech is inadequate and that we deliberately misrepresent our progress” was false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8mx45"&gt;“We don’t want to see hate on our platform, nor do our users or advertisers, and we are transparent about our work to remove it,” Rosen wrote. “What these documents demonstrate is that our integrity work is a multi-year journey. While we will never be perfect, our teams continually work to develop our systems, identify issues and build solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJJ8la"&gt;The post appeared to be in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184?st=fdxfcqdeo7a0g8a&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;Sunday article in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the Facebook employees tasked with keeping offensive content off the platform don’t believe the company is able to reliably screen for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQ2tTz"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report states that internal documents show that two years ago, Facebook reduced the time that human reviewers focused on hate speech complaints, and made other adjustments that reduced the number of complaints. That in turn helped create the appearance that Facebook’s artificial intelligence had been more successful in enforcing the company’s rules than it actually was, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbcLey"&gt;A team of Facebook employees found in March that the company’s automated systems were removing posts which generated between 3 and 5 percent of the views of hate speech on the social platform, and less than 1 percent of all content that was in violation of its rules against violence and incitement, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DXjt5"&gt;But Rosen argued that focusing on content removals alone was “the wrong way to look at how we fight hate speech.” He says the technology to remove hate speech is just one method Facebook uses to fight it. “We need to be confident that something is hate speech before we remove it,” Rosen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzZ4aK"&gt;Instead, he said, the company believes focusing on the prevalence of hate speech people actually see on the platform and how it reduces it using various tools is a more important measure. He claimed that for every 10,000 views of a piece of content on Facebook, there were five views of hate speech. “Prevalence tells us what violating content people see because we missed it,” Rosen wrote. “It’s how we most objectively evaluate our progress, as it provides the most complete picture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sLsMO"&gt;But the internal documents obtained by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; showed some significant pieces of content were able to evade Facebook’s detection, including videos of car crashes that showed people with graphic injuries, and violent threats against trans children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXO6As"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has produced a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;series of reports about Facebook&lt;/a&gt; based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. She &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress &lt;/a&gt;that the company was aware of the negative impact its Instagram platform could have on teenagers. Facebook has disputed the reporting based on the internal documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JTuO5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hollywood union reaches contract agreement over streaming pay to avoid strike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IATSE members were planning to strike over working conditions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oRsoeSw0SamTPXDkYUnwIJFP8X4=/0x663:4842x3891/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70007039/1235538501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;IATSE members were planning to strike over working conditions | Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QdWdaR"&gt;The union representing thousands of film and television production workers has reached a tentative agreement with studios, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;averting an strike&lt;/a&gt; that was set to begin Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSHoK1"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents major production studios like Netflix, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, and Disney. IATSE sought improved working conditions, including weekend rest periods and higher pay scales on streaming shows for its members, who work in many behind-the-scenes roles in Hollywood, such as broadcast technicians, animators, and makeup artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQTTc5"&gt;The new three-year deal, which still has to be ratified by members, includes retroactive wage increases of 3 percent annually, daily rest periods of 10 hours and weekend rest periods of 54 hours, according to a &lt;a href="https://iatse.net/landmark-tentative-agreement-reached-for-iatse-west-coast-film-and-television-workers-before-strike-deadline/"&gt;post on IATSE’s website&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes “improved wages and working conditions for streaming,” but no specific details on what that includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cft0dK"&gt;Streaming was a major sticking point in the negotiations; under IATSE’s existing contract streaming productions received “greater flexibility” regarding pay and benefits to workers. That’s because when the contract was negotiated in 2009, streaming was a new industry with an unclear market. But streaming has become a billion-dollar industry in the years since, and IATSE argued that the pay structure for streaming productions should be adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woUVRc"&gt;The deal will stave off a walkout that would have had a major impact on Hollywood. But IATSE said negotiations are continuing on a separate contract for people who work on movies and shows produced in other parts of the country, including New York, New Mexico, Georgia, and Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROZnFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKtMQZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s October ‘Unleashed’ event: what to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s event invitation " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oi-uXZIeOn-WK1BMGztkj7lVk2s=/40x0:2026x1324/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70006949/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNYIIT"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;announced an event for October 18th&lt;/a&gt;, with a video containing the title “Unleashed.” If you’ve been watching the rumor mill, it won’t come as a surprise — the company still has a lot of products that are expected to come out this year but haven’t shown up in an Apple keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGTo0P"&gt;Chief among those are new, more powerful MacBook Pros, which will follow the incredible Apple Silicon-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;launched last November&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also expected to release new AirPods, and it’s got an entire OS that was announced but hasn’t shipped. Read on for a deep dive into the rumors surrounding these products and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8GOXLV"&gt;Redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOdB06"&gt;Most of the rumors about the event concern redesigned MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;expected to feature 14- and 16-inch screens&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new Apple processor. Mark Gurman and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; (who have pretty solid track records when it comes to rumors) have both said that the laptops will feature iPhone 12-esque flat sides with a redesigned MagSafe charging port and that they’ll no longer have the Touch Bar that’s been a staple of many MacBook Pros since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X7XVE4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ports, glorious ports&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yUBXN1"&gt;Apple is also rumored to be bringing ports back to its laptops with the redesign. The new MacBooks Pros may include an SD card reader and HDMI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;and MagSafe ports&lt;/a&gt;, which will be familiar (and possibly beloved) by people who miss the days when MacBooks had more than one type of port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IPyTE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-set-for-first-macbook-pro-revamp-in-five-years-on-oct-18"&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; that the laptops will be powered by new chips, which are expected to be more powerful variants of the M1 processor found in today’s computers. The “M1X” (or M2, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1448040028832034817"&gt;whatever name Apple actually goes with&lt;/a&gt;) is expected to have more high-performance cores than its predecessor (eight instead of four) and even offer a choice of 16 or 32 graphics cores (compared to the M1’s seven or eight). What’s still unclear is whether the new processor will do away with any of the seeming limitations of the M1: none of the Apple Silicon Macs are configurable with more than 16GB of RAM or 2TB of storage, they can’t run more than two displays, and none of them have more than two Thunderbolt ports (the iMac has at most two Thunderbolt ports and two USB-C ports). Traditionally, the higher-end MacBook Pros have four Thunderbolt ports, though the inclusion of MagSafe and HDMI may make that less necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrfJmQ"&gt;If you’re thinking, “Wow, these new computers sound like everything I ever could’ve wanted,” you’re not alone — a lot of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1448073292401815552?s=20"&gt;are hyped about the rumors&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s worth keeping in mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;that those don’t always pan out&lt;/a&gt;). If it turns out that Apple has taken all of the community’s feedback to heart, the chip shortage could make these laptops hot-ticket items for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PcLJiF"&gt;A Pro Mac Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xpSfDk"&gt;Gurman also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that a more powerful Mac mini would be coming soon, featuring the same processor found in the updated MacBook Pros and more ports than are currently available on the M1-powered Mini. It’s an interesting rumor because the M1 Mini has one of the widest port selections available on an M1 Mac with USB-A, HDMI, two Thunderbolt ports, and optional 10-gigabit ethernet. But the 2018 Intel-based version, which a lot of people think of as the Mac Mini Pro (in part due to its space grey color), has all of that &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; two more Thunderbolt ports. For those looking for a powerful Apple-powered desktop, a replacement for the 2018 Mac Mini could be a great option, given the lack of rumors about a 27-inch iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QY8S1M6eh04Y9-69e2-O4oqQJ9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925277/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_4.51.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is still selling the Intel-powered 2018 Mac Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zOUVY6"&gt;New AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chmWak"&gt;Gurman, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-to-be-announced-at-september-event-airpods-2-to-remain-in-the-lineup/"&gt;Kuo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;all reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is working on a follow-up to its regular, non-Pro AirPods and have said that the headphones will feature the shorter stems found on their more expensive counterparts. It feels like AirPods would’ve fit in better at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s iPhone event&lt;/a&gt;, but given that they were absent, we may end up seeing them on the 18th. There is also always the (hilarious) possibility that Apple just announces them via press release like it did the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt;, but with how popular the original ones were, it feels like their successors should get some event time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced macOS Monterey in June.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EePdlG"&gt;A macOS Monterey release date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRQ2vB"&gt;Apple has released iOS and iPadOS 15, but macOS Monterey, which was announced alongside them, is still in beta. It would be a bit strange if Apple released new Macs that were running macOS Big Sur out of the box, especially given that Monterey was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;announced about three months ago at WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple doesn’t announce that the new version of macOS is shipping with the redesigned MacBook Pros, I’ll be pretty surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian spacecraft returns to Earth with movie crew aboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Soyuz MS-18 reentry capsule with Russian film crew lands in Kazakhstan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uz3oNnyxVbsG2-Fb4HVdp5yI0Sc=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70006773/1235934095.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ekvAx"&gt;A Russian actress and director-producer who spent 12 days aboard the International Space Station returned to Earth early Sunday along with cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy who had been in space for 191 days. Actress Yulia Peresild and director-producer Klim Shipenko &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709501/russia-soyuz-launch-actress-producer-filming-movie-space-station"&gt;went up to the ISS on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, to film scenes for the upcoming movie &lt;em&gt;The Challenge,&lt;/em&gt; about a Russian doctor, played by Peresild, who travels to the space station to treat a sick cosmonaut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nwJJG"&gt;The three were aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, which landed at 12:35AM ET in rural Kazakhstan, and will return to Russia later Sunday.    Novitskiy arrived at the ISS on April 9th for his third mission, and has now spent a total of &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/10/17/russian-station-veteran-filmmakers-back-on-earth/"&gt;531 days in space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWnMNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729701/international-space-station-tilted-thrusters-russian-craft-fired-unexpectedly"&gt;The Soyuz craft &lt;/a&gt;the three were on had a bit of trouble Saturday, when its thrusters stayed on longer than expected during an engine check. The ISS tilted out of its normal position before ground crews were able to regain control within about 30 minutes. The crew of the ISS was never in danger, officials said, but it’s the second such incident with a Russian craft in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ElmYi"&gt;Peresild and Shipenko are the first multi-person movie crew to visit the ISS, as part of a commercial arrangement with Roscosmos. Cosmonauts Novitskiy, Anton Shkaplerov, and Pyotr Dubrov  will also have small roles in the movie. &lt;/p&gt;
