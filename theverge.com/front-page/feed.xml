    <title>Modular Framework laptop gets a marketplace for all those modules  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVOYwcxFfarr76rbKKEFGhmQ1NU=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992827/b1b74084_9272_45c1_93a4_d8c4895c697c_Blog21019___Marketplace_Launch___img01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbl4DB"&gt;Framework, makers of the modular 13.5-inch Framework laptop that’s designed to be easily repaired and upgraded, has launched a dedicated marketplace filled with replacement parts and upgrades for its portable computer. Writing in a &lt;a href="https://frame.work/blog/announcing-the-framework-marketplace"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said the marketplace is currently focused on replacement parts and expansion cards, but that it hopes to add more customization modules like additional language keyboards later this year, as well as third-party and community developed modules in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x59BzA"&gt;It’s an important step for the modular laptop, which has been shipping for a little over two months. After all, the laptop’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F51614%2Fframework-laptop-teardown-10-10-but-is-it-perfect&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22725935%2Fframework-laptop-modular-marketplace-launches-spare-parts-upgrades-expansions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10/10 &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; score for repairability&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t matter much if you can’t get a spare part when a component fails. And who cares if a laptop is upgradeable if there aren’t any interesting modules that are actually available to upgrade it with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UQdbqG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Framework Marketplace is now live for ordering replacement parts and upgrades!  This is the foundation of a exciting ecosystem roadmap expanding the customization, upgrade, and repair of incredible products: &lt;a href="https://t.co/26ApysPerf"&gt;https://t.co/26ApysPerf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iKe8TTSVfk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iKe8TTSVfk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Framework (@FrameworkPuter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1447976504097341441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8yfvTu"&gt;The marketplace already includes a range of expansion cards for the laptop, which are designed to slot into its four modular compartments to add everything from extra storage to features like MicroSD card slots or more USB ports. There’s also user upgradeable RAM and storage for sale. But the store is clearly a work in progress, and lists a host of other items like replacement CPU-equipped mainboards, keyboards, and spare parts like batteries and displays as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKPzoD"&gt;Framework has made a solid start at making sure its laptops can be easily repaired when they break, but it’ll be a while longer before we know if it’s truly delivered on its promise of a laptop that can be upgraded over time. It’s a promise that’s been made many times over the years. Just last year, Dells’ attempt at an upgradeable laptop with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294631/alienware-area-51m-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price-features"&gt;Alienware Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;unravelled just one model later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Up3HrW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AV2umY3R0vw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQfHTh"&gt;There have been similar high profile attempts to bring modular designs to smartphones. But over the years, attempts from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172070/lg-next-flagship-g6-smartphone-friends-modules-ces-2017"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.benefitofthedoud.com/post/moto-mods-are-not-dead-but-they-re-not-not-dead#:~:text=Moto%20mods%20led%20to%20us,world's%20first%205G%20mobile%20device.&amp;amp;text=For%20fans%20of%20moto%20z,phone%2C%20you%20can%20buy%20them."&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; have failed to make much of an impact. Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has seen more success, and recently announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone 4&lt;/a&gt; smartphone. But Fairphone’s focus has always been more on easy repairs for longevity, rather than offering upgraded components over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE6zBj"&gt;If you’re interested in picking up a Framework laptop for yourself, the prices start at $999 for an assembled model with an Intel i5-1135G7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. There’s also a model with a more affordable $749 starting price if you’re happy to do some assembly, or more expensive pre-assembled versions with faster Intel i7 CPUs, and more RAM and storage. All versions come with a 13.5-inch 3:2 2256 x 1504 display, a 1080p webcam, and 55Wh battery. As of this writing, Framework’s website says new orders are due to ship next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends AirPods Pro repair program for crackling or ANC issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fd4XpFdUwrRRGx7eXmiuL17ewU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992754/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro, first released in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRcibj"&gt;Apple has quietly extended a repair program for the AirPods Pro that offers free repairs or replacements for earbuds that have issues with noise cancellation or static. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/q7kov9/psa_apple_silently_extended_the_airpods_pro/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-extends-airpods-pro-repair-program/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) were first to spot the change to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues"&gt;support page for the repair program&lt;/a&gt;, which now notes that the program covers affected AirPods Pro for three years after their first retail sale, rather than two. The page appears to have been updated at the beginning of October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdzcWg"&gt;The support program was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542846/apple-airpods-pro-repair-recall-program-noise-cancellation-static"&gt;originally introduced in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, one year after the original &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;release of the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. It meant that Apple’s repair program was introduced at the exact point that the warranty on launch units was set to expire. With the extension of the repair program to three years, AirPods Pro bought at launch should now be covered right up until October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvyRXC"&gt;As a reminder, Apple says it will fix the following issues with the AirPods Pro: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r8TjET"&gt;Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dz2WK"&gt;Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md31O7"&gt;If you’re experiencing any of these issues, you now have a whole extra year to get off your butt and get a free fix as part of the repair program, which, in our experience, often means Apple giving you an on-the-spot replacement pair to take home. To do so, Apple says you should contact its support team or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or else make an appointment at an Apple Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpNvqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPKFnB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Ncase M1, a crowdfunded marvel of a PC case, has been discontinued </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UO_tk4l57IGzLCf6A-ur3RXKGXE=/345x0:2595x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991816/ncase_m1_render_coke.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final product wound up being remarkably faithful to this early render.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ncase&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13kMCd"&gt;In 2012, fed up with the sorry state of small-form-factor (SFF) computer cases, &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/ncase-m1-a-crowdfunded-mini-itx-case-updates-in-first-post.1717132/"&gt;two users on the HardOCP community forum&lt;/a&gt; decided to create their own. Wahaha360 and Necere came up with the $200+ &lt;a href="https://ncases.com/products/m1"&gt;Ncase M1&lt;/a&gt;, a 12.7-liter marvel designed to put every cubic centimeter of that space to good use. Amazingly, they managed to attract the attention of renowned PC manufacturer Lian-Li to manufacture small batches of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fncase-m1-prototype-a-mini-itx-case%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22725010%2Fncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;their crowdfunded case&lt;/a&gt; out of high-quality aluminum, and the result was greeted with rave reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="813Ekz"&gt;Nine years later, though, &lt;a href="https://ncases.com/blogs/news/farewell-m1-classic"&gt;Ncase has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s discontinuing the M1 for good. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WfSlj5hXU64HNDiwCp8oZLNGn6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924630/ncase_m1_classic.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mikqhf"&gt;It’s a weird situation. Yesterday, the company posted that it had discontinued the M1 entirely — but overnight, the post was updated to read that it’s just the current “classic” design that’s gone for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivGj5J"&gt;Ncase tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that’s because there’s a successor on the way. “I can say that what we are working on will follow the formula the M1 pioneered, updated and modernized to better reflect the current hardware market,” Ncase says, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VDSOTk"&gt;Video cards, especially, have on average grown significantly larger over the past couple of years - a fact that has hurt the M1’s compatibility, which had previously been very good for its size. The M1 was already highly space-optimized, so accommodating such larger cards was not possible within the current design footprint. Hence the need for a more thorough redesign from the ground up, which also allows us the opportunity to explore alternate manufacturing methods, updates to the visual design, and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NSEmgG"&gt;That makes some sense: This isn’t a product that’s particularly out of date or where demand has suddenly dried up. While there are many worthy imitators like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BF8YMXC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Cooler Master NR200&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-TU-150WX-Aluminum-Mini-ITX/dp/B07X8Z5V53?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lian-Li’s own TU-150&lt;/a&gt; — with a neat integrated carry handle, too — the Ncase M1 is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; widely regarded as one of the best cases on the market. Would-be buyers were eagerly awaiting another batch, which was tentatively slated for November.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQDCBs"&gt;But it is true that some of the oversized coolers on the most recent generation of graphics cards keeps many of them from fitting well in the M1. (Still, you can easily stuff a RTX 3080 Ti Founder’s Edition in there if you’ve got enough airflow and a potent power supply. I certainly did!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06WqXo_Ew5BSdo1hD9st8HSFmMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925218/M1_v2_04_1500x750.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Praise the M1’s pop-off panels, a staple of Lian-Li cases. You can even fit a slim-line optical drive or SSD under the front shield.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RhMzmT"&gt;It’s worth noting that Ncase’s founders do work on other PC cases as well. For example: The 14.7-liter &lt;a href="https://ssupd.com/products/meshlicious"&gt;SSUPD Meshlicious&lt;/a&gt;, a mass-market case that SFF specialist YouTuber Optimum Tech &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKpNt1o6l_Y"&gt;called “the 2021 ITX case to beat”&lt;/a&gt;, is also a Wahaha360 product made by Lian-Li. (So is the 9.5-liter FormD T1, another case that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FormD/comments/pp72se/t1_v20_official_updated_from_v15/"&gt;gets produced in small batches&lt;/a&gt;.) Ncase also collaborated on &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/mach-one-a-chimera-x-ncase-collaboration.1961617/"&gt;a design called the Mach One&lt;/a&gt;, too — and if you told me that its &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/the-next-ncase-project-a-steam-machine-style-case-indeterminate.1831382/"&gt;LRPC concept&lt;/a&gt; inspired Microsoft’s Xbox One S, below, I wouldn’t bat an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sCt3xF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10806172"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIIzQ2"&gt;It feels premature to pour one out for the best computer case I’ve ever owned, one that I plan to keep using for years and one that’ll likely make a cameo appearance in even more &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviews than the ones you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;might’ve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;clocked&lt;/a&gt;. But even if we might be getting an Ncase M2 someday, I don’t mind pressing F for the legacy this brand built. Ncase helped change the face of SFF cases, and whether you’re buying your next one from them or someone else, our desks are better for it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/odqyy9siji6kdolmAGT3_YnoMdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925234/1826930.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To think the comparatively gigantic BitFenix Prodigy (right) was considered a groundbreaking Mini-ITX case in 2012. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Adam Neumann is back, and he just got HBO Max to cave to his demands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37bipwg-vk1xAyc0A_-vhaFvEfo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991770/acastro_191111_1777_wework_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE2lpK"&gt;Months after HBO Max original docuseries &lt;em&gt;Generation Hustle&lt;/em&gt; debuted on the service, a team representing WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann says the streamer has changed some language in an episode that mapped the startup’s rise and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"&gt;spectacular demise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in8KWH"&gt;In a press release sent to a staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week, defamation attorney &lt;a href="https://clarelocke.com/professionals/thomas-a-clare-p-c/"&gt;Thomas A. Clare&lt;/a&gt; — who now represents the known &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21011740/nicholas-braun-cousin-greg-succession-wework-adam-neumann-casting-announcement"&gt;tequila enthusiast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872777/we-work-adam-neumann-tequila-weed-ipo-eternal-life"&gt;reported aspiring immortal&lt;/a&gt; — announced that HBO Max had altered parts of a &lt;em&gt;Generation Hustle &lt;/em&gt;episode, titled “Cult of WeWork,” as well as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbomax.com%2Fseries%2Furn%3Ahbo%3Aseries%3AGYFuzsAQIP73CUAEAAAAd&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22725397%2Fhbo-max-edits-cult-of-wework-adam-neumann-generation-hustle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its description&lt;/a&gt; on the HBO Max site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="takyHq"&gt;Previously, the show’s description said it combined “true-crime capers with fresh, glossy stories of charismatic fakes” and “colorful imposters,” according to a version of the site archived on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428091004/https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYFuzsAQIP73CUAEAAAAd"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Both the characterization of the series as “true crime” and the aforementioned description of its subjects have since been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8Nadx"&gt;The service also changed language in the end cards shown in the episode by specifying that while Neumann is being investigated, “no criminal or regulatory charges have been filed.” The episode also now includes language that WeWork is &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wework-ipo-coworking-spac-deal-stock-market-public-listing-2021-9"&gt;preparing to go public&lt;/a&gt;. While the language in the cards and the show’s and description have been updated, a spokesperson for the HBO Max told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that no alterations had been made to the episode itself. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/adam-neumann-scam-wework-hbo-generation-hustle-changes-ipo-1234854081/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; on the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cisZLp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We hope these responsible steps ... put an end to the mischaracterizations of Adam’s successful role in creating a transformational business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1X7oFI"&gt;“HBO did the right thing here by promptly retracting these false implications about Adam and the history of WeWork, and we applaud the network for taking these responsible steps,” Clare, Neumann’s attorney, said in a statement. “The media has repeatedly gotten the story of Adam wrong, and we hope these responsible steps by a reputable outlet will help put an end to the mischaracterizations of Adam’s successful role in creating a transformational business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4eYDA"&gt;An HBO Max spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Clare’s conflation of the changes with HBO — rather than HBO Max — was incorrect. The company had no further comment to share on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wu2itF"&gt;When asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; why the edits were announced nearly six months after the show’s premiere in April, a spokesperson for Neumann’s team said that the changes were made “in the last few days.” Neumann retained his defamation counsel on January 14th of 2021, according to the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is removing ex-Raiders coach Jon Gruden from Madden after email scandal</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9NcaW"&gt;Electronic Arts is removing former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 22 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jon-gruden-email-demaurice-smith-11633721045?mod=e2tw"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/sports/football/what-did-jon-gruden-say.html?"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that he had used racist, homophobic, and misogynistic language in emails. Gruden resigned as the Raiders’ coach soon after the emails came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmetFl"&gt;“EA Sports is committed to taking action in maintaining a culture of inclusion and equity,” EA said on in a statement posted to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/1448393205297332232"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;NFL&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. “Due to the circumstances of Jon Gruden’s resignation, we are taking steps to remove him from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 22&lt;/em&gt;. We will replace him with a generic likeness via a title update in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flvuCL"&gt;This isn’t the first time EA has made changes to its hit football series in response to real-world events. In 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328954/ea-madden-nfl-21-washington-redskins-name-logo-removal"&gt;changed all references to the Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt; after the franchise announced it would be dropping the brand. Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was removed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/8/4505076/ea-to-remove-aaron-hernandez-ncaa-football-14-madden-nfl-25"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;NCAA Football 14&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after being convicted of first-degree murder in 2013. And former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/9/9/6126945/ray-rice-suspended-domestic-violence-nfl-madden"&gt;was pulled from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after a video surfaced of him hitting his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5MSbe"&gt;Gruden’s emails were included among 650,000 that were reviewed as part of an NFL investigation into workplace misconduct at Washington Football Team.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration gives offshore wind farms a big boost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Views Of General Electric Co.’s First U.S. Offshore Wind Farm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNFSLIxHwKp9O2oEq3dHQ5sisa8=/0x37:4546x3068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991458/609022718.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The GE-Alstom Block Island Wind Farm stands in the water off Block Island, Rhode Island, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016. | Eric Thayer/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jEgeSN"&gt;Offshore wind farms could be coming to nearly every coastline along the continental US. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland today &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-outlines-ambitious-offshore-wind-leasing-strategy"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to auction off leases to developers for up to seven new areas by 2025. That includes waters in the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Maine, Central Atlantic, New York Bight (between Long Island and New Jersey), and off the coasts of Oregon, California, and the Carolinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqkKiB"&gt;It’s a big scaling up of offshore wind in the US, which lags far behind Europe when it comes to deployment. The US’ first commercial-scale offshore wind farm just got federal approval in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430981/offshore-wind-farm-commercial-scale-federal-approval-vineyard-wind-massachusetts"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt;. Two existing, smaller operations in US waters have a combined capacity of just 42 megawatts. The Biden administration set a goal of pushing capacity up to &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/"&gt;30,000 MW by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. Europe, home to a majority of the world’s offshore wind, already had nearly that much installed in &lt;a href="https://windeurope.org/intelligence-platform/product/offshore-wind-in-europe-key-trends-and-statistics-2020/"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSkUh1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Expanding to other shores will come with new technical challenges&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjlBGe"&gt;The US’ first offshore wind projects are all along the East Coast. Expanding to other shores will come with new technical challenges. On the Pacific coast, waters get much deeper, much closer to shore compared to the US’ Atlantic coastline. That makes it more difficult to affix turbines to the seafloor. The White House &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453282/joe-biden-california-west-coast-offshore-wind"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that it would open up two areas off the California coast to commercial-scale wind farms and indicated that it might turn to new technology for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448187/ge-floating-turbine-offshore-wind-farm-energy"&gt;floating wind farms.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6IHx1"&gt;Turbines in the Gulf of Mexico will have to contend with hurricanes and soft soils, recent &lt;a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2020/studies-find-gulf-of-mexico-well-positioned-for-offshore-wind-development.html"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; from the National Renewable Energy Lab found. Still, shallow water and smaller waves make the Gulf ripe for wind development. New offshore wind industry here could potentially also benefit from existing infrastructure and know-how from the region’s history of offshore oil and gas drilling. The very &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/future-energy-is-blowing-in-wind/"&gt;first wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; was built with the help of ships from Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XNxoh0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A pipeline of projects that will establish confidence for the offshore wind industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNiblb"&gt;“We are working to facilitate a pipeline of projects that will establish confidence for the offshore wind industry,” said Amanda Lefton, Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, in a statement today. It could still take years to get offshore turbines up and running. Proposed wind farms have historically struggled with permitting delays, local opposition, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296979/us-offshore-ships-wind-boom-installation-vessels"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt; of specialized installation ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7STeDA"&gt;But with droughts, wildfires, storms, and coastal flooding growing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;more intense in the US as a result of climate change&lt;/a&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724258/fossil-fuels-forecast-climate-change-international-energy-agency"&gt;no time to lose&lt;/a&gt; in the transition to clean energy. The Biden administration’s offshore wind push is part of a larger goal to get the country’s electricity grid running entirely on clean energy by 2035 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1N4Mm7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is trying out ads in the perfect new place: right in the replies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ElP5KBM9fJ0hQkj9zDlvzThvhgA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991326/acastro_170726_1777_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuvCPN"&gt;I don’t know about you, but I sometimes feel like Twitter is overloaded with ads in my feed. Unfortunately, those ads don’t seem to be enough for the company, though, because it’s testing a new place to show them: right in the middle of conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRNIhC"&gt;The new ad format is in testing on iOS and Android, and you’ll see ads after the first, third, or eighth reply to a tweet if you’re in the test, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417?s=21"&gt;according to Bruce Falck&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter’s revenue product lead. He shared a GIF of what the new in-conversation ads look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aDjUzj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, we’re trying something different and testing a new ad format in Tweet conversations. If you’re a part of this test (which is global; on iOS &amp;amp; Android only), you’ll see ads after the first, third or eighth reply under a Tweet.  ️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvIGeYt2vp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kvIGeYt2vp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bruce.falck()   (@boo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1YvOyb"&gt;The in-conversation ad looks exactly as you’d expect, but I can’t say I’m a fan. Twitter can already be a pretty overstimulating place, especially if I take a risk by tapping into potentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713211/twitter-pre-tweet-prompt-fight-intense-conversation"&gt;heated replies&lt;/a&gt;; I don’t know if I want to have to cognitively process ads amongst other junk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440425/elon-musk-impersonator-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-twitter-scam-report-ftc"&gt;like Elon Musk impersonators&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, I don’t seem to have been selected for the test just yet, so at least for now, any conversations I read are ad-free.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iOS app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days. Last spring, iOS 14.5 introduced a new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency that may have made its users happier but did not endear Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is still available in iOS 15, along with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22403523%2Fios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some new privacy features&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The version that first appeared in iOS 14.5 allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you don’t have to do anything; you are automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond, or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out. There have been no such problems reported recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzW1Zi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 5:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to acknowledge that iOS 15 has shipped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1ocu3"&gt;Some TV studio was going to be the first to tie a big NFT project to a major show, and it turns out to be Fox — the company is launching the MaskVerse, an NFT collection / game / thing that ties into &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer&lt;/em&gt;. Fox has shown interest in doing NFT tie-ins before, but this one leans on a community aspect that we’ve seen other NFT projects use (sometimes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664469/bored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount"&gt;great success&lt;/a&gt;, other times &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nft-evolved-apes-scam/"&gt;to disaster&lt;/a&gt;). Fox also seems like it wants this project to become more of A Thing than &lt;a href="https://curionft.com/collections/american-gods-motel-america"&gt;the collectibles released by other TV shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpgHoZ"&gt;The company says that the first NFT for the show, which will be free and grant “special access” to the MaskVerse’s Discord, will launch on Wednesday (along with, of course, an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer&lt;/em&gt;). After that, people can buy packs of NFTs to build collections, and come November, Fox will be adding a game where players can vote on what will happen to contestants of the game show. The prize for guessing right will be the opportunity to buy even rarer NFT packs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mzOwEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4gpUY"&gt;Fox says that people will be able to trade or sell their NFTs halfway through &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer’s &lt;/em&gt;season so that they can build complete collections. Getting a full collection of “Common Masks” will let you get access to even more exclusive digital items, &lt;a href="https://www.fox.com/article/maskverse-faqs-61660a4e44c9630020a29ac3/"&gt;according to the MaskVerse FAQ,&lt;/a&gt; as well as the possibility of real-life prizes (and, presumably, some extra clout in the Discord). The NFTs will at first only be purchasable using credit cards or PayPal, but Fox says support for cryptocurrencies is coming “soon.” If you’re interested in the nitty-gritty of the blockchain tech the company is using to do all this, &lt;a href="https://www.fox.com/article/maskverse-faqs-61660a4e44c9630020a29ac3/"&gt;the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; goes pretty in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2wZ0Q"&gt;Fox has shown a lot of interest in doing show-based NFTs before, even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441078/fox-blockchain-animated-series-dan-harmon-nft"&gt;announcing that it’s created a company&lt;/a&gt; called Blockchain Creative Labs to make that happen. It already announced &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis&lt;/em&gt;, a show created by &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; co-creator Dan Harmon that will be “curated entirely on the Blockchain.” Instead of focusing on releasing content and related merch on the blockchain, it seems like the MaskVerse is Fox trying to tap into a show with a pre-existing fanbase to get people excited about NFT trading, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot-style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TAAR4y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The MaskVerse is a bit more than collectibles for a show&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bbMRQB"&gt;That’s not a surprising move with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;recent hype around NFT communities&lt;/a&gt; like the Bored Ape Yacht Club or Pudgy Penguins, but it will be interesting to see whether it’s successful — will the potential perks be interesting enough to get &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer’s&lt;/em&gt; mainstream audience invested in an NFT game? Will the promise of NFTs get crypto people into the show? It’s hard to tell if either is likely, but given that Fox’s FAQ says the blockchain has an open event log, it should be relatively easy to tell how many people are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook attempts to stop leaks by making some message boards private</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DjkVDj"&gt;For weeks, Facebook has been dealing with numerous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686364/facebook-oversight-board-xcheck-moderation-exemption"&gt;bombshell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;revelations&lt;/a&gt; resulting from a huge cache of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;leaked internal documents&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Facebook is making some groups on its internal Workplace message boards about platform safety and protecting elections private, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/technology/facebook-workplace-transparency-leaks.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The move is seemingly in an effort to prevent further leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0zRwp"&gt;It’s unclear exactly how many groups will be taken private, so we don’t know how broadly Facebook is locking things down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTstip"&gt;“Leaks decrease the effectiveness, efficiency, and morale of the teams working every day to address the challenges that come with operating a platform for billions of people,” Facebook said in a statement. “They can also put employees working on sensitive subjects at risk externally and lead to complex topics being misrepresented and misunderstood.” The company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the move had been in the works for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMiW8v"&gt;Facebook’s decision follows last week’s Congressional testimony by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt;, a former staffer in the Civic Integrity group who was the source of the leaked documents. On Monday, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721229/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-instagram-oversight-board"&gt;accepted an invitation&lt;/a&gt; to speak to Facebook’s independent Oversight Board, and later this month, she is scheduled to testify &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58870495"&gt;before the UK Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTuF1f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 7:53PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added context from Facebook that the change had been in the works for months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
