        &lt;figcaption&gt;This weekend, it’s not just the red Apple Watch Series 6 getting a discount. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LV8f67"&gt;The red Apple Watch Series 6 has already seen an array of big discounts, but you don’t always get nice pricing on the more subtle colorways. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F435851135%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are both currently offering $75 off the handsome navy-colored watch, as well as the white model, bringing them down to $325. Walmart also has a few more colors available at the same price, and both offer the red at an additional $6 markdown. In addition to a myriad of fun colors, Apple’s latest and greatest wearable also offers built-in sleep tracking, a blood oxygen sensor, and an always-on display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qigDsv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Eaty"&gt;Amazon and Google may be paving the way toward a smarter home, but not every device under the sun touts smart capabilities yet. Luckily, there are devices like TP-Link’s Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini. The simple, voice-enabled device works with virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as IFTTT, giving you an easy way to control your plugs via Wi-Fi and set a schedule. Normally $18, you can grab TP-Link’s compact smart plug at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749634942986522554" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftp-link-wifi-mini-smart%2F-%2FA-52107189" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target for $10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FxCYbE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Matter’s interoperable smart home standard has been delayed to 2022","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="UNtlbK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YUqPyP"&gt;If you own a PlayStation 4 or the PlayStation 5, a subscription to PlayStation Plus is really a no-brainer. The premium service grants you access to online multiplayer, free monthly titles, and 100GB of cloud storage, along with exclusive deals on select games, add-ons, and preorders. It also lets you take advantage of the PlayStation Plus collection, a catalog that contains some of the best PlayStation games to date, including hits such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17223854/god-of-war-review-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/3/8339241/bloodborne-is-a-blood-soaked-bone-splintering-masterpiece-on-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Best of all, if you’re a new subscriber, you can land a 12-month subscription to &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/IP9101-NPIA90005_01-PSPLUSDIS50OFF1Y/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus for just $30&lt;/a&gt; through August 30th, half off what it would typically cost for Sony’s landmark service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z4jXiS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ClAtmV"&gt;We’ve been tracking this deal on the AirPods Pro — the best one since Black Friday — for a few days now. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are still offering $70 off a new set of the popular noise-canceling earbuds, bringing the final sale price down to $180. Not only are the true wireless earbuds built around the Apple-designed H1 chip, which gives them always-on support for Siri, but they feature great noise cancellation and deep integration with iOS, adding to their convenience. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="juoMF5"&gt;To celebrate &lt;em&gt;Quake’s&lt;/em&gt; 25th anniversary and the game’s wider release on consoles, Steam is offering big discounts on many great games as part of its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/bethesda/sale/quakecon2021?snr=1_4_4__118" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QuakeCon sale&lt;/a&gt;. You can currently take your pick from a plethora of solid titles, including entries from the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Dishonored franchises, though, personally, we recommend the modern Doom titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yevur5"&gt;The widely beloved &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 2016 title responsible for ripping and tearing the classic franchise back from the brink of potential obscurity, is just $5 (50 percent off). Last year’s sequel, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is $15 (75 percent off), and even &lt;em&gt;Eternal’s&lt;/em&gt; two DLC expansions, &lt;em&gt;The Ancient Gods&lt;/em&gt; Parts &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098292/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_One/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098293/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_Two/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, are 50 percent off or available together for $15 as the &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098291/DOOM_Eternal_Year_One_Pass/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Year One Pass&lt;/a&gt;. That is a ton of collective hours of fast-action, FPS chaos for cheap. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doom Eternal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s app indicates a rowing machine may finally be coming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yXshOGZE5I1Ka4DI0YS5_nieCnA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69756000/akrales_190328_3240_0067.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bAM8Zz"&gt;Peloton’s rumored rowing machine may finally be on the way, according to text that &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/20/peloton-app-confirms-rower-prepares-scenic-waterways/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; discovered in the Peloton Android app&lt;/a&gt;. When looking through the app’s code, &lt;em&gt;9to5 &lt;/em&gt;discovered references to the rowing machine we’ve been hearing about for the past couple of years — including instructions on how to do a rowing stroke, as well as language suggesting Peloton will offer real-world water scenery that people could view on a screen while rowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFX2M3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/peloton-to-sell-cheaper-treadmill-and-a-rowing-machine-in-2020?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;wrote about plans for a Peloton rower&lt;/a&gt; nearly two and a half years ago. More recently, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/peloton-rower-job-posting/"&gt;job listings&lt;/a&gt; mentioning a rower, and Peloton’s CEO has made multiple comments &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/peloton-john-foley-rower-strength-bloomberg/"&gt;about rowers&lt;/a&gt; and rowing. If information about the rower is starting to show up in the app’s code, though, it may signal that the machine is already in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLTTM7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; found two potential code names for the project: “Mazu” and “Caesar” (&lt;em&gt;9to5 &lt;/em&gt;had to be clever to find the names, as they were scrambled using a cypher). Mazu is one of the names of a legendary Chinese water deity, which fits with the idea that the product is a rower. It’s also a name that’s &lt;a href="https://www.pelobuddy.com/apple-watch-gymkit-integration-product-code-names-bike-titan-tread-prism-rower-mazu/"&gt;shown up in Peloton’s code before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DBhLHd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It makes sense that Peloton would want to compete with machines being called “the Peloton of rowers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HaGhm8"&gt;Peloton won’t be the first to get to the smart-rower market, however — &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/tmrw/i-tried-peloton-rowing-it-earned-its-reputation-t214266"&gt;other companies&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/hydrow-rower-review"&gt;already produced machines&lt;/a&gt; that some reviewers have called “the Peloton of rowers,” one of which was even released in 2019, months before &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;revealed Peloton might have one as well. Still, it makes sense that the actual Peloton would want a piece of that market. It could also give another class of athletes an entry point into the Peloton ecosystem, which might help the company gain more subscribers for its memberships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFkwRB"&gt;Recent months haven’t been kind to Peloton — it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627383/peloton-tread-recall-update-repair-fix-screen"&gt;working to make its treadmills safer&lt;/a&gt;, after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;issued a recall for the machines&lt;/a&gt; due to a string of injuries and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;tragic death of a child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khu85a"&gt;When asked for comment about &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s findings, Peloton responded “while our R&amp;amp;D team is always working on new ideas, we have no new products to announce at this time.” There have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545560/peloton-wearble-heart-rate-monitor-fitness"&gt;recently been rumors&lt;/a&gt; that the company is working on another new hardware product: an armband to monitor your heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has already discontinued the Pixel 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFKZY6bXeGT0HV_l6DYodE_VOts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755977/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 (top) and 4A 5G (bottom) will likely sell out soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmNmf8"&gt;Amidst the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627253/google-pixel-5a-specs-price-screen-battery-availability"&gt;news of a new Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; this week, Google quietly indicated that it’s the end of the road for two other Pixel devices: the Pixel 4A 5G and the Pixel 5. Both are currently listed on Google’s online store as sold out, and remaining stock at other retailers likely won’t last long. A company spokesperson offered the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aijLY1"&gt;With our current forecasts, we expect Google Store in the U.S. to sell out of Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 in the coming weeks following the launch of Pixel 5a (5G). These products will continue to be available through some partners while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vZ4hZ6"&gt;It’s not too surprising that the 4A 5G being discontinued given that the 5A 5G looks to be a fairly direct successor. However, it is a little unusual to see the Pixel 5 discontinued well in advance of the Pixel 6’s arrival this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgLLT"&gt;Maybe that’s because the Pixel 5 bears more of a similarity to the budget-oriented A-series phones than it will to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Google appears to be pulling out all the stops for the 6-series, positioning them as true flagship competitors to Apple and Samsung’s heavy hitters. While the Pixel 5 offers step-up features like wireless charging and robust IP68 waterproofing not available in the A-series, it wasn’t quite specced out to compete with the iPhone 12 Pros and Galaxy S21s of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dtg2K6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gv7Azf"&gt;Or maybe this is just how Google does things now — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356745/google-pixel-4-xl-discontinued-out-of-stock"&gt;stopped selling the Pixel 4 and 4 XL&lt;/a&gt; less than a year after their introduction. But on the bright side, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;the LTE-only Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt; is still on sale for now, and it’s a steal for its $349 price tag. You’ll just need to like baby blue... er, &lt;em&gt;barely blue&lt;/em&gt;, since the “just black” model is sold out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook suppressed report that made it look bad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9FWXI1kITJeifpLLl1M12W8Ab4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755807/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V13Di4"&gt;On Wednesday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"&gt;released a report&lt;/a&gt; about what content was most viewed by people in the US last quarter. It was the first time it had released such a report. But &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/facebook-popular-posts.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook was working on a similar report for the first quarter of 2021 that it opted not to share because it might have reflected poorly on the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYUyXH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, which obtained a copy of the report, says that the most-viewed link in the first quarter had a headline that could promote COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330428/facebook-research-vaccine-hesitancy-doubt-coronavirus"&gt;been an issue on the social media platform&lt;/a&gt;. The headline read, “A ‘healthy’ doctor died two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why.” The article was published by &lt;em&gt;The South Florida Sun Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; and republished by &lt;em&gt;The Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlnMWp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Executives feared it could be a public relations issue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdOyEp"&gt;Facebook was working on releasing this report, but executives, including Alex Schultz, Facebook’s CMO and VP of analytics, apparently “debated whether it would cause a public relations problem, according to the internal emails” and ultimately decided not to publish it, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mgn0u9"&gt;“We considered making the report public earlier but since we knew the attention it would garner, exactly as we saw this week, there were fixes to the system we wanted to make,” Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement. Stone also clarified Schultz’s opinion on if Facebook should release the report, saying that Schultz “advocated for putting out the report.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEYVkp"&gt;It’s been a busy week for Facebook. In addition to publishing the report about the top-viewed posts, it has also had to contend with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22627032/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-complaint-monopoly-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company by the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans shares its new policy banning sexually explicit content</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4J_yBcxRxOru_E9pDP4eIT3iHBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755572/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEuVCT"&gt;On Thursday the video and image sharing site OnlyFans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;announced plans to ban “sexually-explicit content”&lt;/a&gt; starting October 1st. While we’re still not sure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633411/onlyfans-banned-explicit-porn-sex-content-after-bbc-investigation-leak"&gt;exactly why&lt;/a&gt; it’s changing so drastically, it just sent out an updated Terms of Service policy to the creators who’ve built the site detailing exactly what won’t be allowed going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olv5aF"&gt;Comparing &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/aup"&gt;the new OnlyFans Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms#acceptable-use-policy"&gt;the old one&lt;/a&gt; makes the additions clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldp61G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not upload, post, display, or publish Content on OnlyFans that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uQlMlr"&gt;Shows, promotes, advertises or refers to “sexually explicit conduct”, which means:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WdnGw0"&gt;actual or simulated sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, between persons of any sex;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vyQkWo"&gt;actual or simulated masturbation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5JghHn"&gt;any exhibition of the anus or genitals of any person which is extreme or offensive;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qVoqtP"&gt;actual or simulated material depicting bodily fluids commonly secreted during sexual conduct;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RvKYs8"&gt;All existing Content that shows, promotes, advertises or refers to “sexually explicit conduct” (which has the meaning given to it in section 5(b) of this Policy) must be removed before December 1, 2021, or by any other date which we communicate to Users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="R2BTyO"&gt;Other sections of the policy that ban deepfakes, drugs, or violence, remain unchanged. In an email to OnlyFans creators, the site specified that “Content containing nudity will continue to be allowed as long as it is consistent with the policy.” Posts can show off body parts, but doing anything explicit (or zooming in too close) means they will be in violation. Any breach “may lead to your account being suspended or terminated, and access to your earnings being revoked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2vQWc"&gt;OnlyFans has largely built its billion-dollar business and brand on sex workers providing exactly the kind of content that’s being banned. Now those content creators have until December 1st to wipe any traces of the suddenly unacceptable content from their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance to attempt second Mars soil scoop, hoping rocks don’t ‘crumble’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UcLnp0uMv2ii2W91r3ydGMKA1AE=/0x29:1280x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755428/26115_NavCam_Left_LF_0164_0681506334_116CWS_N0060000NCAM00315_0A00LLJ01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo showing the hole drilled during Perseverance’s first sample collection attempt, that left the rover’s sample tube empty. | NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dpGLWZ"&gt;NASA’s Mars rover, Perseverance, is getting ready for another attempt, in the coming weeks, to scoop up Martian rocks after its first attempt earlier this month didn’t play out as engineers expected. The rover’s sample-caching arm worked, engineers say, but the sampling tube turned up empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdRc2b"&gt;Now the rover, a science lab on wheels that landed on Mars in February, will drive to a new location called Citadelle for a second shot at picking up its first rock sample. This time, to make sure a sample is actually collected, engineers will wait for images of the sample tube to come back before it gets processed and stowed inside the rover’s belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzpnPc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘No sample? What do you mean no sample?’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DeFyBB"&gt;“We were just super excited that the hardware worked from beginning to end without any faults. And then there was that surprise — ‘No sample? What do you mean no sample?’,” Louise Jandura, the Chief Engineer for Sampling &amp;amp; Caching on NASA’s Perseverance team, says of the first attempt on August 5th. “So quickly, after that sunk in, we started to do the investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr746o"&gt;The rock that Perseverance’s sampling drill bit dug into wasn’t as sturdy as scientists thought it’d be. What was supposed to be a fairly solid rock core turned out to be a crumbly powder that slipped out of the rover’s sampling tube. After finding the sample tube was empty, mission staff used the rover’s cameras to analyze remnants of the hole that Perseverance drilled. They figured the mound of dust around the hole and some material at the bottom of the hole were what slipped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VpGUBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10711752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fsFhuu"&gt;“The rock simply wasn’t our kind of rock,” Jennifer Trosper, Project Manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Although we had successfully acquired over 100 cores in a range of different test rocks on Earth, we had not encountered a rock in our test suite that behaved in quite this manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qOvkK"&gt;Perseverance’s seven-foot, five-jointed sampling arm reaches out from the front of the rover toward a rock of interest with a large shoe box-sized head, or turret, on the end that weighs 100 pounds. That head packs a hollow drill bit, formally called a &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25565/rotary-percussive-corer-drill/"&gt;Rotary Percussive Corer Drill&lt;/a&gt;, that drills into the rock and traps material inside a tube, which gets stowed back into the rover and processed inside another tube until it’s ready to get left somewhere on the Martian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRhAY0"&gt;The drill bit used for Perseverance’s first sampling attempt is for collecting rock cores. Some of the rover’s 9 drill bits are better suited for collecting regolith — the more crumbly, dirt-like material that engineers accidentally encountered during the first sampling attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4cdQmktesLoKSKzW6ls5W0T3_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22796020/Aug_20_2021_17_07_53.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RvHkpa"&gt;Perseverance’s mission to collect up to 35 samples of Martian rocks is the first leg of a three-pronged endeavor to return those samples back to Earth sometime in the 2030s. The rocks, stowed inside tiny chalk-sized sample tubes, would represent the first pristine Mars samplings ever captured and returned to Earth by humans. Perseverance will leave the tubes somewhere on the Martian surface for a future NASA robot to collect and launch into Mars’ orbit, where another spacecraft built by the European Space Agency will catch and carry it the rest of the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPDtSL"&gt;NASA engineers spent nearly a decade designing and building the rover’s sampling system, which Perseverance’s chief engineer Adam Steltzner has described as “the most complicated, most sophisticated thing that we know how to build.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdeYj0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story on the tiny details that make game development so hard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_81k_pKy_JQd7_NZqRx3mPS-Wh8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755412/vpavic_180607_2652_0093.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wRHSzi"&gt;While many video games might feel nearly effortless to play, letting you make impossible jumps, drive cars at breakneck speeds, cast magic out of thin air, and so much more, actually &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; those games is a superhuman feat of its own. Just one game often requires the efforts of a huge team laboriously crafting every minute detail, and very little of it that comes easy, as detailed by numerous developers who spoke to &lt;em&gt;IGN’s&lt;/em&gt; Rebekah Valentine in &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-hardest-part-making-game-everything"&gt;this article that you should read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AqQzN"&gt;Valentine’s article has a lot of fascinating stories from developers answering this question: “What is a thing in video games that seems simple but is actually extremely hard for game developers to make?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ws3n1j"&gt;Take elevators, for example, which, in a video game, aren’t just a moving platform behind doors. &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; lead level designer Bill Gardner described the potential problems of just trying to get inside one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1YlbrY"&gt;First off, you have to summon [an elevator] via a button or whatever. By calling the elevator, you open the opportunity for the player, objects, or AI to wander underneath it and get squished or trapped. So suddenly you have to deal with that. It’s an invitation to make your enemies or companions look dumb, for physics objects to go flying, or for quest items to get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o1nKCT"&gt;Or how about the act of responding to any player input? Here’s how Johnnemann Nordhagen, a developer at Dim Bulb Games, discusses it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="USqAwU"&gt;Something I’ve spent many hours on is player input. It seems simple — you press spacebar; you jump. But then you start to fall into all the special cases. What if the player is crouching? What if you want the spacebar to also activate items that the player is standing near? What about players using controllers instead of a keyboard? What about letting players remap their control scheme? What happens when the game is paused, or in a menu? What if, God help you, this is a networked game and you need to send that to a server? It turns into a system that requires multiple layers of abstraction to be able to handle all the possible things that might happen in a game when a player wants to jump, or presses the spacebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="CdP82n"&gt;And developers in the article don’t just discuss the challenges of game mechanics; they also describe difficult aspects of things like storytelling and localization. Here’s just one really good anecdote, from JC Lau, a producer at Harebrained Schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GqABYb"&gt;When I worked at Xbox in localization, it was when the console rolled out its friends list feature and there was a little popup that said, ‘Socialize with your friends’ directing people to use the friends list. In Polish, that got translated to ‘Support socialism with your friends,’ which was thankfully caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pVyfFR"&gt;The whole article is packed with other interesting details and stories. Great games are easy to take for granted while playing them, but these developers’ tales are a good reminder that game development can be very hard. I highly recommend taking a few minutes out of your day to &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-hardest-part-making-game-everything"&gt;go read Valentine’s story on &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM recalls all Chevy Bolts for fire risk </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0LUgRKwKZ0R2xp_Ta2_R1XRQFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755322/akrales_170313_1481_A_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZY2mfP"&gt;General Motors is &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/aug/0820-bolt.html"&gt;expanding its recall&lt;/a&gt; of the Chevy Bolt to include all models — including the two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs"&gt;new versions&lt;/a&gt; released earlier this year — after multiple fires in the electric vehicle’s battery packs caused by defects in the LG Chem cells found inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKfAVd"&gt;GM is warning owners not to charge their Bolts in or near their homes overnight, and to park the vehicles outside when not being charged. It’s also asking owners not to charge their Bolts above 90 percent, or to deplete the battery to below 70 miles of remaining range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79Mv2L"&gt;Owners should follow these guidelines until replacement modules — the groups of batteries that make up the pack — are ready. It’s not clear when that will be, though. GM says it will “only begin replacing battery modules in customer vehicles when GM and LG are confident in the safety of LG’s product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ncAfjV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Replacement batteries will only be available when “GM and LG are confident in the safety of LG’s product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WrGDf3"&gt;“We are working aggressively with LG to adjust production to have replacement modules available as soon as possible,” Daniel Flores, a spokesperson for GM, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs8yDc"&gt;GM had already recalled the 2017-2019 model year Bolts twice after the initial fix — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;in which new software was supposed to help stop any fires from happening&lt;/a&gt; — appeared not to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPALkR"&gt;The expansion of the recall comes after a 2020 model year Bolt caught fire this week in the United States. A video of the fire had been posted to YouTube but was removed a few hours later, and users on Reddit had noticed that it was a newer Bolt that wasn’t subject to the original recalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evc6Zg"&gt;GM confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the vehicle was in fact a 2020 Bolt, but said it has not had a chance to inspect the remains of the electric car. “That vehicle is certainly troubling but we base recall decisions on data,” Flores said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr0K7f"&gt;In July, GM confirmed that the fires happen when there are two defects present in the LG Chem batteries that power the Bolt. On Friday, the company specified that the defects are a torn anode tab and a folded separator in the cell. It also shared that the defects are in cells made at multiple plants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UQtvy3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The recall has cost GM nearly $2 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9QwCn"&gt;“After further investigation into the manufacturing processes at LG and disassembling battery packs, GM discovered manufacturing defects in certain battery cells produced at LG manufacturing facilities beyond the Ochang, Korea, plant,” GM wrote in a statement. “GM and LG are working to rectify the cause of these defects. In the meantime, GM is pursuing commitments from LG for reimbursement of this field action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEMln9"&gt;The recall has cost GM some $800 million to date, but the company said Friday that the expanded recall will cost an additional $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkELeb"&gt;GM is not alone in having trouble with LG’s batteries. Hyundai had to recall the Kona EV earlier this year after a handful of vehicles caught fire. The company even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396480/hyundai-discontinue-kona-ev-korea-battery-fire-recall"&gt;discontinued the electric SUV in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, as sales cratered following the fires and the recall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Th6wda"&gt;But GM’s partnership with LG runs deep. GM and LG are spending billions of dollars building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387129/gm-lg-tennessee-ultium-battery-factory-spring-hill"&gt;battery factories in the US&lt;/a&gt; to supply cells for the automaker’s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, including the Hummer EV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos reportedly used his unlimited wealth to put an ice cream machine in his house</title>

  &lt;p id="SiQBww"&gt;We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264856/jeff-bezos-worth-amazon-founder-ceo-193-billion-dollars"&gt;made suggestions to Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; about what he could do with his hundreds of billions of dollars before, and we’re certainly &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JC083abgY1w?t=36"&gt;not the only ones to do so&lt;/a&gt; — but it seems like we’ve all been thinking small. While the public has been calling on Bezos to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HasBezosDecided"&gt;end world hunger&lt;/a&gt; or buy vaccines for almost two-thirds of the planet’s population, Bezos has been able to live out every child’s wildest dream by putting a soft-serve ice cream tap in his house, according to ice cream machine maker CVT Soft Serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cM37kX"&gt;The “What The Actual. Fuck? !?” part of CVT’s caption seems to express surprise that the billionaire would do this, but I’m honestly unsure why. Who wouldn’t want their own ice cream machine if they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246203/data-visualization-billionaires-wealth-inequality-jeff-bezos-net-worth"&gt;all the money&lt;/a&gt;? If I were as rich as Bezos, I’d have an entire Golden Corral (which, from what I remember, has soft serve machines along with those garbage, delicious &lt;a href="https://www.georgehowe.com/jelly-beans/"&gt;big jelly beans&lt;/a&gt;) built next to my house. I might even be generous enough to let the general public eat there for free — ice cream is best when shared with others, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQWBua"&gt;Of course, the reaction online to Bezos’ ice cream has been hilarious. The &lt;em&gt;Washingtonian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/08/20/finally-we-have-learned-what-amazons-hq2-is-supposed-to-resemble/"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon’s HQ2 design looks suspiciously like a cone of soft-serve (which is a much nicer mental picture than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262149/amazon-helix-arlington-virginia-design-hq2-campus"&gt;imagining it as a poop emoji&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported the story with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VICE/status/1428061712247410702"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt; saying that “Big boy Jeff no longer has to leave his house for ice cream.” And, of course, there have been untold numbers of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_EeCkHs-e0"&gt;Bo Burnham&lt;/a&gt; references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaS4Cn"&gt;All of this raises one serious question — what’s Jeff Bezos’s diet like? There are &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-elon-musk-bill-gates-mark-zuckerberg-diets-2019-3"&gt;other billionaires who have famously bizarre diets&lt;/a&gt;, like Warren Buffet, who &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-diet-2017-10#of-course-buffett-eats-ice-cream-for-breakfast-of-course-i-was-the-idiot-who-saved-it-for-the-last-day-17"&gt;eats ice cream for breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, tons of McDonald's, and drinks Coke almost constantly. Will Bezos be joining him on the ice cream for breakfast train, or saving it as a special treat? These are the questions the world needs answers to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FzNLcB"&gt;Oh, and we did ask CVT Soft Serve if we could interview the person who delivered the ice cream to Bezos. Unfortunately, the company told us that it couldn’t share any details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is using a custom logging device to track the trucks moving its freight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ZzGjwwumMl0EIxmLA3WJ_9adJM=/150x0:4050x2600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69755052/1155745555.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FjSI4T"&gt;Amazon has developed electronic tracking technology for the trucks used by its partners to monitor their movement and hopefully improve driver safety, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-amazon-tracking-device-to-monitor-trucker-safety-collect-data"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Electronic logging devices (ELDs) are federally required to prevent fatigue-related accidents on trucks, but now it seems Amazon will offer its partners a custom ELD offering, possibly giving Amazon direct access to a lot more data from a tool it maintains itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlYtjo"&gt;Amazon’s Relay ELD — named after the company’s &lt;a href="https://relay.amazon.com/"&gt;Relay platform&lt;/a&gt; for booking delivery jobs — works by plugging hardware into the diagnostics port of trucks to directly digest information from the engine, &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;writes. It then communicates that data over Bluetooth to be logged in an accompanying app. ELDs typically track location, movement, and when a truck turns on or off, to monitor drivers' hours. When asked, Amazon didn’t explicitly confirm that it had created its own ELD hardware. “As with many solutions, we use a third party for hardware manufacturing,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K4xQrL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ELDs are required, whether they’re made by Amazon or not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="StUgu4"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon’s ELD product is being offered to members of the Amazon Freight Partners Program (who often also lease trucks from the company) with the plan to have them installed in hundreds of tractor trucks by the end of the year. Amazon was able to confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it had begun piloting new ELDs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LS7AZB"&gt;“We are actively investing in safety mechanisms across our operations and recently started piloting new electronic logging devices, which are required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, with a select number of carriers to capture driver compliance with Hours of Service regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gb9fkp"&gt;Amazon says that currently the new ELDs are being piloted on six tractor trucks, to monitor &lt;a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service"&gt;hours of service (HOS)&lt;/a&gt; compliance — basically the maximum amount of time a driver is on duty, including breaks. The company didn’t share if the data is used for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjZJ9Z"&gt;The location and movement data Amazon sees could help make sure drivers are taking rest breaks on long-distance trips, or potentially help the company make other logistics-related decisions. Previous plans that put cameras in the cabs of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-amazons-trucking-ambitions"&gt;semi-trucks&lt;/a&gt; have also raised questions about what kinds of Amazon monitoring go too far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fPq72"&gt;Still, an ELD seems far less invasive than a camera — and again, the ELDs would be there anyway — but it’s still a valuable piece of a larger information puzzle, for keeping drivers safe, and Amazon packages on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ed4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
