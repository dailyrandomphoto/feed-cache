    <title>Here are two podcasts from our Windows 11 coverage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tY3Pw3BFITeX-bNZjmse_0d9hRo=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504359/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xnoEEN"&gt;On Thursday, we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;official reveal of Windows 11 at Microsoft’s event&lt;/a&gt;, which showed off a redesign of the Microsoft operating system — including a replaced Start menu, updated app store, and lots more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvOUrq"&gt;This week on&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;dedicate a majority of the show to talk about &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/microsoft"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. Co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Tom Warren discuss the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548950/microsoft-windows-11-skype-onenote-live-tiles-cortana"&gt;biggest changes from Windows 10 to 11&lt;/a&gt;, the complications of bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Android apps to Windows with Amazon’s app store&lt;/a&gt;, and how Microsoft’s stance on being an open platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"&gt;has evolved among the other tech giants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jb4s6f"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9322407846&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RARQ6f"&gt;We also have a sort of companion piece to this week’s show: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22549385/microsoft-satya-nadella-interview-windows-11-decoder"&gt;Nilay spoke with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a&gt; on our other podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/decoder"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder with Nilay Patel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to chat about Windows as a platform, what Microsoft’s responsibilities are, and how he thinks the various antitrust bills in Congress will affect Microsoft’s plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ccx5uN"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3710346080&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bisrWQ"&gt;I would suggest listening to the interview with Satya Nadella first, as Nilay makes a few references to the interview in the &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; episode. Both episodes together cover everything you need to know about the new update of Windows announced this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon acquires encrypted messaging app Wickr</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN-TzdSqLMdRsg91tiRP7eyPM10=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504312/1232270762.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeff Halstead/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bfl2Dv"&gt;Wickr, the encrypted messaging app founded in 2012, has been purchased by Amazon, the company &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-welcomes-wickr-to-the-team/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvoPHE"&gt;“We’re excited to share that AWS has acquired Wickr, an innovative company that has developed the industry’s most secure, end-to-end encrypted, communication technology,” Stephen Schmidt, Amazon Web Services’ vice president, wrote. With a nod to the company's ever-deepening relationships with the military, and Washington in general, Schmidt added that Wickr’s features give “security conscious enterprises and government agencies the ability to implement important governance and security controls to help them meet their compliance requirements.” Schmidt himself has a background in this space: his LinkedIn &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenschmidt1/"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; notes he spent a decade at the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvE2Zs"&gt;Wickr’s app — like secure messaging competitor Signal — has been popular with journalists and whistleblowers; it's also been a go-to for criminals, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnapp/amazon-acquires-encrypted-messaging-app-wickr"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear if the proximity to the tech monolith will impact the app’s popularity for free users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygW8SR"&gt;In Amazon’s case, Schmidt indicates the acquisition was at least partially influenced by the need to preserve information security while working remotely. “With the move to hybrid work environments, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, enterprises and government agencies have a growing desire to protect their communications,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54vlBU"&gt;Schmidt says AWS will be offering Wickr services effective immediately. Current Wickr users shouldn’t see significant changes for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s new virtual concert might be its trippiest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZtrQr6-_2scW0MEcxi4Y9V_1o4=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504241/Fortnite_20210625085348.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mRwckH"&gt;Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello first took the virtual stage in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, developer Epic Games has experimented with different ways to bring music into the game. That could mean &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;a gigantic Travis Scott stomping around the battle royale island&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;building a separate space dedicated explicitly to live performances&lt;/a&gt;. This week’s musical experience featuring English band Easy Life is yet another new technique: a strange world built in&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s creative mode. It might be the trippiest virtual concert yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="neQ73F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"},{"title":"Fortnite is launching a concert series it hopes will become a ‘tour stop’ for artists","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pFYuGF"&gt;It starts out normal enough. Players are ushered into a virtual re-creation of The O2 Arena in London, where the band welcomes you via gigantic screen. From there, things get progressively weirder. First, you’re pushed into a room that slowly fills with water before you’re flushed down a gigantic toilet into a surreal desert filled with massive tube TVs. It’s a bit like a pop art take on Salvador Dalí. Subsequent locations are just as odd: you’ll dance inside the corpse of a huge monster, ride a hoverboard across a twisted city straight out of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;, and then float amid the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cb9t9UjBTCSjPJJ0p094Mgp0Kes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681124/Fortnite_20210625084911.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzgEEhpfSXlI8EmMEcoAvulSROo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681089/Fortnite_20210625090538.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWqM5fMjZpV8RWcBuCcPXmeJi80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681210/Fortnite_20210625085727.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="innItU"&gt;Each area is also outfitted with lots and lots of screens where you can watch the band. There are TVs floating in the sky and even some wedged between the ribs of the deceased monster. It’s kind of like watching a series of music videos while hanging out in a bunch of weird virtual spaces. You can dance, run, and jump, but there are no guns or ways to mess with other players. The videos also match the theme of the locations: when you’re in the desert, for instance, all of the band are buried to their necks in sand. At the end, a sense of normalcy resumes, with players transported to a luxury box back at the arena, like you’re waking up from a dream. The whole thing lasts about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrD6ld"&gt;The Easy Life event, which runs until 7PM ET on June 27th, presents an interesting middle ground for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concerts. The Travis Scott and Marshmello shows were impressive but were also huge undertakings; the entire battle royale game comes to a halt in order to accommodate them. (That’s likely the reason there have only been two since 2019.) Meanwhile, concerts in party royale — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242668/fortnite-party-royale-social-space-metaverse-travis-scott"&gt;a violence-free social space that debuted in 2020&lt;/a&gt; — are relatively simple, as players can gather together to watch a performance on a big screen. Easy Life’s show, meanwhile, has the best of both worlds. It was built in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-like creative mode, so it exists in its own space distinct from the main game, but it’s also much stranger and more interactive than the party royale events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWgAFI"&gt;Music is clearly a big part of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s plans as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;it continues to shift into something much more ambitious than a multiplayer shooter&lt;/a&gt;. “Our lofty goal is to create the entertainment experience of the future,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;Epic’s chief creative officer Donald Mustard told me in March&lt;/a&gt;. And utilizing the creative seems like a good way to make these experiences both more interesting and more regular. At the very least, it’s a chance to listen to an up-and-coming band while riding a hoverboard across some skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK antitrust watchdog investigating Amazon and Google over fake reviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NSvDmpli0c9roK5vI-hjdFn3gb0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503997/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tSRFlx"&gt;The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is probing whether Amazon and Google broke consumer laws by failing to take action against fake reviews on their sites, the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-amazon-and-google-over-fake-reviews"&gt;agency announced Friday.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yhtNr"&gt;“We are investigating concerns that Amazon and Google have not been doing enough to prevent or remove fake reviews to protect customers and honest businesses,” Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations.” She added that it was unfair to businesses that adhere to the rules if other businesses can give their own products fake 5-star reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wheaY"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that the company devotes “significant resources to preventing fake or incentivized reviews” from appearing on its platform, adding that the company works to ensure reviews accurately reflect a customer’s experience with a product. “We will continue to assist the CMA with its enquiries and we note its confirmation that no findings have been made against our business,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qqBOR"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience"&gt;June 16th blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said some “bad actors” were using external platforms to buy and sell fake reviews, and it blamed social media companies it said had been slow to act in flagging fake reviews on their own platforms — although it noted the response time had improved somewhat over the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQqfGb"&gt;“While we appreciate that some social media companies have become much faster at responding, to address this problem at scale, it is imperative for social media companies to invest adequately in proactive controls to detect and enforce fake reviews ahead of our reporting the issue to them,” the blog post reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DaVSdR"&gt;Amazon recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;removed several gadget brands’&lt;/a&gt; storefronts from its site following a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; into fake reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTg7Y5"&gt;A Google spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that it has strict policies that clearly state that reviews must be based on real experiences, “and when we find policy violations, we take action— from removing abusive content to disabling user accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZezrMt"&gt;Once it concludes its investigation, the CMA can take enforcement action if it finds Amazon or Google broke UK consumer protection laws, which could range from getting commitments from the tech firms to change how they handle fake reviews to possible court action. The CMA noted that, at this stage, it “has not reached a view” on whether the companies broke any laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7adHW2"&gt;The investigation is the UK regulator’s latest attempt to scrutinize fake reviews on US tech platforms. In April, Facebook removed 16,000 groups that were trading fake reviews after the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-intervention-leads-to-further-facebook-action-on-fake-reviews"&gt;CMA raised concerns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CZ2pp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbPtjS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfPEJr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF48ml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Panos Panay on building Windows 11 during a pandemic, Android, and the leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AQi48XT8wsTqfHHsaJ4cMU3xFWY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503946/Panos_Panay_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NhV8Zu"&gt;The big &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;Windows 11 leak&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month was never part of Microsoft’s plan. Developers at the company have spent the majority of the pandemic working from home and secretly building a new version of Windows that’s designed for a post-pandemic era. “It didn’t really leak. It was some early weird build,” says Microsoft’s Windows and devices chief Panos Panay in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It didn’t matter, when something like that gets out incomplete, you’re like: okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1JrPc"&gt;Panay describes it as just another test of patience in the distinctive journey of how Windows 11 came to be. Just months before the pandemic began, Panay stood onstage and introduced the world to two new dual-screen devices: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;. These were supposed to revolutionize the way we work on the go — then the pandemic hit, and the world stopped going anywhere. Panay says he still believes in dual-screen devices, but the world of PCs has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcFMPevTNZw1fOQabEDKCqhp0RQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19247635/akrales_190930_3649_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Neo device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zeHGBr"&gt;“You have to step back and consider what’s most important for people right now, and so much has changed over the last 18 months,” explains Panay. “A lot of the time spent over the last 18 months&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;[within Microsoft]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was looking at Windows and what it means to be for what’s next [with hybrid work].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8TRBc"&gt;Microsoft was planning to ship Windows 10X, a simplified version of Windows made for dual-screen devices, on its Surface Neo device. The company quickly pivoted toward &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;promising Windows 10X for laptops&lt;/a&gt; once the pandemic began and then eventually reworked the OS into Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GhSzN"&gt;The PC market had its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth spurt in a decade during 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s clear Microsoft saw a big opportunity in the reported 75 percent year-over-year increase in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;time spent in Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;All signs are pointing toward a mix of working from home and the office, and Windows 11 is the result.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“The PC started to move from fitting into people’s lives to shifting our lives to fit into the PC,” says Panay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_OcrdhinUDzFoBkEbHtpt-BLM6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681057/Wondows_11_Start.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gDZNqD"&gt;Windows 11 was born out of a pandemic, and that influence is clear. “We designed this product living through the pandemic worldwide,” says Panay. Windows engineers used Microsoft Teams to communicate daily, and that way of working has clearly inspired at least one Windows 11 feature: universal mute. A new mute button appears on the taskbar in Windows 11, and it works across apps to prevent embarrassing microphone moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpZSeN"&gt;It almost feels like time away from the office made Microsoft realize some of the other pain points in Windows for remote workers. This is highlighted best in a new Windows 11 feature that will finally group your apps on the screen you left them on if you’re using multiple monitors or connecting up a laptop to a monitor. (In Windows 10 currently, your apps will often be randomly rearranged when you disconnect or reconnect a monitor.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z28RbJ29WRoywRhihamjB5AEcRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681063/mute_unmute.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s new universal mute button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B6vqo8"&gt;The distinction between work and play has blurred considerably during the pandemic, and Windows 11 seems designed to tackle both states equally well. For the former, Microsoft Teams is integrated directly into Windows 11. Android apps will also run alongside Windows apps and offer access to the mobile and tablet apps that aren’t typically associated with the productivity world of Windows.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Think about it this way: what is it that you want to do with your device, and where do you want to do it?” asks Panay. “Ultimately, Android plays a key role in that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y9OEG"&gt;Microsoft has been trying to get tablet and mobile apps onto Windows for years, and whether developers share that same desire remains to be seen. Microsoft is now supporting UWP, PWA, win32, and Android apps in its own app store, which is good news for developers and consumers alike. It’s a far more open store and a significant change that could see additions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550103/microsoft-new-windows-app-store-steam-welcome"&gt;Steam being part of the Windows store&lt;/a&gt; one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abQ3lI"&gt;Windows 11 isn’t finished yet, though. Microsoft now has months of testing to complete before a wide release is available in October. And yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546801/microsoft-windows-11-free-upgrade-details"&gt;upgrades for existing Windows 10 users are free&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m proud of what the team has done, and I feel super proud of that team holding together and getting to this point today,” says Panay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hybrid work is coming to big tech. Its contractors might not be so lucky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FRANCE-ECONOMY-HEALTH-VIRUS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJeccnQcyc1wYovV-Wtr19gpbMM=/0x0:5453x3635/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69503849/1229318293.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRoNjf"&gt;In fits and starts, the US is reopening — in many cases to the chagrin of office workers who have settled into work-from-wherever setups they’ve had the past 16-ish months to perfect. And given the willingness of many of those same workers to quit rather than go back to full-time cubicle life, many companies have offered some form of “hybrid” arrangement as a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrj36O"&gt;It seems that benefit isn’t being extended to all workers, though. Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft were short on concrete answers as to which contingent workers — which comprise sizable, sometimes majority portions of their workforce, and perform functions from hospitality and security to content moderation and coding — if any would be allowed to work remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="CCIz44"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10619076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sbMzdw"&gt;Each of these tech giants appear to be instituting some version of partial remote work for corporate employees, with some minor variations. &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/22/the-philosophy-and-practice-of-our-hybrid-workplace/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; each announced these changes publicly on their corporate blogs, while internal memos to the same effect within Facebook and Apple were reported on by the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-lets-more-employees-choose-full-time-remote-work-or-return-to-the-office-11623258049"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. All instituted a future of what Microsoft hazily described as “working from home part of the time (less than 50%) as standard for most roles,” and its competitors as some variation of requiring three days per week in the office. Apple took the extra step of mandating which three days — Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WerBel"&gt;There are of course, caveats in both directions. Some roles were flagged by Facebook and Amazon as not being remote work-applicable: jobs like hardware engineers and data center workers. On the other hand, nearly all of these companies noted that eligible employees could remain fully remote if they were granted that permission by their manager. Google even &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-rolls-out-tool-to-show-its-employees-compensation-changes-for-transferring-offices/"&gt;developed a tool&lt;/a&gt; that will show remote workers how much it plans to shave off their salaries if they go the remote option and move somewhere with a lower cost of living. (Thanks?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA3t6B"&gt;Missing from any of these memos or announcements, though, was any mention of whether remote work options were available to the legions of contractors that help these companies function. Spokespeople for most of these companies sidestepped the question. “When it comes down to our contractors and partners, I wouldn’t be able to speak on their behalf or how they would implement our policy,” an Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Facebook provided a similar answer. Facebook’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for a list of which agencies they used for contract labor so that we could ask each company about its remote work policies, while Amazon declined to provide one citing “confidentiality reasons.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8YErj"&gt;A spokesperson with Google stated that temporary staff would likely be required to come in the same days as the teams of employees that oversee them, while the companies that employ its contingent “vendors” had already determined which jobs could or could not perform their work remotely. The same spokesperson was not able to provide an approximate percentage for how many of these vendors would have that benefit extended to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hzmjz"&gt;Through an external communications agency, a spokesperson for Microsoft wrote that aforementioned corporate blog was “all the company has to share.” Apple did not respond to multiple requests for information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qnZ98"&gt;It’s logical to defer to these external agencies, but it also belies how much leverage tech companies have in these relationships. Microsoft has previously &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/076474aa0b1b47b6b4790dbf98ed6108"&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; firms it works with provide paid childcare leave for its contractors; Google too has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-require-suppliers-give-benefits-workers/"&gt;mandated&lt;/a&gt; contractors receive at least $15 per hour, healthcare, and parental leave. Facebook has also &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/05/compensating-and-supporting-contractors/"&gt;instituted&lt;/a&gt; “well-being and resiliency training” for its contractor moderators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBDFO2"&gt;It’s also a bit hard to believe — especially in instances where these workers would be reporting to these companies’ facilities — that these companies lack any direct oversight over who is coming into their offices at a time when indoor capacity limits are not only a matter of corporate policy, but often a matter of state mandate too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgpBMi"&gt;The issues of remote work for contractors is also not a new one — and much earlier in the pandemic it caused quite a bit of bad PR for several of these companies. Facebook took heat from having some of those same content moderators working from the office back in November, a month where the US was seeing around 100,000 new cases of covid daily — and from awarding monetary bonuses to employees &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/17/facebook-coronavirus-bonus-contractors/"&gt;but not to contractors&lt;/a&gt;. Google was requiring some contractors to report to work in person in March of 2020, sparking internal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184495/google-employees-memo-contract-workers-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;backlash from its own employees&lt;/a&gt;; it also rescinded job offers to around 2,000 contractors — citing the economic downturn — while apportioning $1,000 each for employees to purchase desks and other items for their from-home workspaces. Around the same time, hundreds of contractor jobs with Apple were reportedly suspended without pay — only to be restored after a contingent of unionized janitors and the Wall Street Journal began &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-commits-to-paying-contractors-after-some-were-told-theyd-lose-work-11585667276"&gt;asking questions&lt;/a&gt;. Most of this &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7j7mb/amazon-delivery-drivers-are-overwhelmed-and-overworked-by-covid-19-surge"&gt;barely holds a candle&lt;/a&gt; to what Amazon’s considerably more frontline delivery contractors experienced, as a whole country, trapped inside, dramatically increased its online purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqZlJx"&gt;This is all relevant insofar as it illustrates that the two-tiered system of employment within these companies is alive and well, but also that these very big, very wealthy companies, supposedly staffed by the best and brightest, had many, many months to consider a return to office plan that would be transparent and comprehensible. Contractors themselves, and a news media willing to report on them, has been asking how tech companies will handle this disparity in benefits &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/09/tech-contractors-coronavirus/"&gt;essentially since the pandemic began&lt;/a&gt;. A year and a half later, there’s still no clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDduGv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From surfing Facebook’s wake to trying to get big enough for a better deal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uIu3gS"&gt;How much is it worth to be shareable? BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti is hoping for about $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PHgnQ"&gt;BuzzFeed &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210624005657/en/"&gt;has agreed to go public&lt;/a&gt; through an acquisition by 890 Fifth Avenue Partners, a publicly traded company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;with no purpose except to buy another company.&lt;/a&gt; (890 Fifth Avenue Partners is part of a recent wave of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;some startups are using to go public&lt;/a&gt;.) As part of the deal, BuzzFeed is also acquiring Complex Networks, another media company, for $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tAq5pe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BuzzFeed was an experiment to discover what content people would share on social networks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lpzbjP"&gt;Cast your mind back, if you are able, to the antediluvian era, before the 2008 crash. Peretti, who had graduated from the MIT Media Lab, had taken his expertise in online popularity — which, in that era, was search engine optimization — to found &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post &lt;/em&gt;in 2005. A year later, he created BuzzFeed as an experiment to discover what content people would share on social networks. In 2011, when AOL bought &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Peretti left — and BuzzFeed became his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIC9Az"&gt;This was a significant shift, one that Peretti was quicker to understand than a lot of other web types. In the SEO era, you could fake it based on the right keywords — “What time is the Super Bowl?” — but people wouldn’t share that kind of thing. People had to &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; share something on Facebook because they liked it or because they liked what sharing it said about themselves. From the jump, BuzzFeed was interested in truly massive scale, and most of its content was aimed at surfing Facebook shares to traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODYZp7"&gt;It worked. At first, BuzzFeed focused mostly on quizzes and memes, but in December 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/business/media/at-buzzfeed-the-significant-and-the-silly.html"&gt;Peretti hired Ben Smith&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; to build out a news division. People shared news, too, after all — and sharing was the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsALyQ"&gt;“One thing Jonah was saying very early on that people thought was crazy — &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; thought he was crazy — was that platforms were like cable networks, and we had to find distribution on the new networks,” says Smith, now the media columnist for &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. “Ultimately, directly or indirectly, they were going to pay.” This turned out to be true, to some degree; BuzzFeed set up several lucrative relationships with platforms such as Snapchat. Smith declined to comment on whether the news division was profitable while he ran it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="48FZbz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At the time, BuzzFeed’s dependence on Facebook was seen as savvy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jK1FnX"&gt;From the beginning, BuzzFeed did headline A/B testing — and the headline that got more shares was the one that won. The revenue bet, at first, was on sponsored content since there were no display ads. HBO would pay for a quiz (&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hbogameofthrones/how-would-you-die-in-game-of-thrones"&gt;“How Would You Die In “Game Of Thrones”?&lt;/a&gt;) or Pillsbury would pay for a listicle (&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/pillsbury/10-things-you-never-knew-you-could-do-with-a-cresc-2pec"&gt;“10 Things You Never Knew You Could Do With a Crescent Roll”&lt;/a&gt;). People would share things if they liked them or if they thought they were good — something most people won’t do for other kinds of ads. That meant BuzzFeed’s sponcon traveled further than competitors’ ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpdQfw"&gt;At the time, BuzzFeed’s dependence on Facebook was seen as savvy: it had unlocked some kind of secret formula, and suddenly, BuzzFeed was everywhere. Other media companies scrambled to catch up with how BuzzFeed was reinventing the culture of a newsroom. BuzzFeed was &lt;em&gt;fun,&lt;/em&gt; several early news hires tell me. “You’d be working in the office, and an army of people would walk in,” Charlie Warzel, a former BuzzFeed tech reporter, says. “And it’d be like, Tyler the Creator and Grumpy Cat. One day, we were working in the newsroom, and we heard this bellowing. And Tracy Morgan came in, just yelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LIx71"&gt;In 2013, Facebook was sending &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/out-of-the-blue-facebook-is-now-driving-enormous-traffic-to"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of traffic&lt;/a&gt; to publishers. The company had tweaked its algorithm such that traffic spiked a nice 69 percent from August to October that year. Facebook was, at the time, trying to compete with the reporters’ platform of choice, Twitter. In retrospect, this should have been a warning shot, but the party went on — and BuzzFeed continued expanding after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html"&gt;an injection of $50 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $850 million. BuzzFeed moved offices, and it was hard to keep up with the influx of new employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="gMXOlY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In 2015, someone wrote to an advice columnist to say, “I hate myself because I can’t work for BuzzFeed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gy9YR2"&gt;“From 2013 to 2015, we mostly looked at platforms as playgrounds,” Warzel says. Sure, they’d be volatile, but they were places to experiment and learn. Several people I spoke to for this article described this period as playful. There was a kind of trust in the platforms, they say. If BuzzFeed evolved and changed with them, there would be nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oaGNX"&gt;Plus, BuzzFeed was considered a cool place to work. In 2015, someone &lt;a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/03/i-hate-myself-because-i-dont-work-for-buzzfeed/"&gt;wrote to an advice columnist&lt;/a&gt; to say, “I hate myself because I can’t work for BuzzFeed.” The letter went on to call BuzzFeed “the most successful media company of our time,” “the future of the media business,” “the most widely recognized media brand among young people,” and predicted it “will inevitably eclipse the major media organizations and one day become a super-hegemonic media power the likes of which we’ve never seen.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQGTeR"&gt;Later that year, NBCUniversal &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-269B-4293"&gt;invested $200 million in the business&lt;/a&gt;, giving it a valuation of $1.5 billion, about double its value in 2014. BuzzFeed wasn’t the only new media company with a sky-high valuation; in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-media-raised-money-at-a-sky-high-valuation-now-the-bill-is-coming-due-11581450643"&gt;Vice was valued at $5.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Vox Media, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, was valued at $1 billion in 2015. (Vice is now in talks for its own SPAC merger that would &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/vice-is-said-target-3-billion-valuation-in-ipo-via-spac-merger"&gt;value it at just $3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Vox Media was valued at $750 million in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-media-valued-at-about-105-million-in-vox-media-merger-11569452124"&gt;when it acquired New York Media&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNwLjA"&gt;Around then, Facebook began favoring video content. BuzzFeed’s strategy, up to that point, had been based on YouTube — to get some ad revenue. But the success of Tasty convinced the company to pay more attention to Facebook, some former BuzzFeed staffers say. The company invested in Facebook Live, Facebook’s livestreaming service. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/brendanklinkenberg/this-exploding-watermelon-was-facebook-lives-biggest-hit-to"&gt;BuzzFeed’s 2016 Facebook Live event of a watermelon being wrapped in rubber bands&lt;/a&gt; until it exploded was viewed as a massive success for the company. “That was massive and exciting in the office,” Warzel says. “Like, ‘Oh, we figured it out again!’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="K8ftYC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was a sense of ‘These people are just dicking us around.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B1g4dL"&gt;But then, Facebook changed its algorithm, deprioritizing video — and traffic tanked. (Later, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/facebook-settlement-video-advertising-lawsuit-40-million-1203361133/"&gt;Facebook would pay $40 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle advertiser lawsuits, after the company admitted it had inflated view counts in 2015 and 2016.) That seemed to sour Peretti and others on the platform. “There was a sense of ‘These people are just dicking us around,’” Warzel tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2wXUx"&gt;In October 2017, Peretti criticized Facebook’s News Feed for supporting low-cost content. “The business model of news is changing, and if Google and Facebook take all the revenue but don’t want to pay for the fact checking, the reporting, the more-intensive investigations, who does that work?” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-ceo-google-facebook-should-share-more-revenue-1508356543"&gt;Peretti said at a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;. That year, BuzzFeed laid off 100 employees after missing its revenue targets by 15 to 20 percent, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-nears-deal-to-go-public-via-spac-eyeing-digital-media-rollup-11624485898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DG6Ab"&gt;By 2018, Peretti was floating the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/business/media/buzzfeed-jonah-peretti-mergers.html"&gt;a merger with other media companies&lt;/a&gt; — to increase their leverage against the platforms and make more money. This struck some staffers as ironic. In 2015, Peretti had told staff, “I don’t think a union is right for BuzzFeed.” Now, suddenly, he was suggesting that media companies should band together, as a group, to increase their bargaining power. But Peretti had clearly been thinking about acquisitions for some time. He almost never said anything publicly that he hadn’t discussed in detail privately, a source says. If he was saying it publicly, he was already committed. (BuzzFeed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/business/media/buzzfeed-news-union-walkout.html"&gt;unionized in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFPwNU"&gt;BuzzFeed tightened its belt in 2019, cutting 43 journalists’ jobs. It sought other revenue streams, selling merch and investing in affiliate agreements with companies such as Amazon. In November 2020, the company announced its plan to acquire what was now called &lt;em&gt;HuffPo,&lt;/em&gt; Peretti’s previous company. (That acquisition valued BuzzFeed at $1.7 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/buzzfeed-to-go-public-in-spac-deal-valuing-it-at-1-5-billion"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;) To welcome them, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; staffers pooled their money and bought a Cameo of Fiona the hippo. Less than a month after the deal closed, BuzzFeed fired 47 &lt;em&gt;HuffPo&lt;/em&gt; journalists in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/mar/09/huffpost-layoffs-buzzfeed-jonah-peretti"&gt;in an online meeting&lt;/a&gt; with the password “spr!ngisH3r3.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="45YZY1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Staffers are trying to figure out how much their options are worth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0yttV"&gt;BuzzFeed turned a profit in 2020 for the first time since 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-nears-deal-to-go-public-via-spac-eyeing-digital-media-rollup-11624485898"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Complex did not; its profits actually fell 14 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BICZ1R"&gt;The deal gives BuzzFeed more cash — $438 million, about $150 million of which is debt financing. Because it is going public through this merger, rather than an IPO, the company wasn’t constrained from giving future projections. In a&lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60cbbb36879f9269a9b2c1e5/t/60d46000058c421e525ff0d2/1624530951725/BuzzFeed+Investor+Presentation.pdf"&gt; slide deck&lt;/a&gt;, BuzzFeed projected that its 2021 profit will be $57 million before taxes and $117 million in 2022. Peretti &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/media/buzzfeed-merger-spac.html"&gt;suggested in a press conference&lt;/a&gt; that his acquisition spree isn’t over with Complex, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfThav"&gt;Now, staffers are trying to figure out how much their options are worth, two current employees told me. Some people who left and bought their options on the way out are just hoping to break even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwDPKN"&gt;Smith, the former &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; head, referred me to his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; disclosure about his stock and declined to say anything further (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/business/media/coronavirus-union-newsrooms.html"&gt;In April 2020&lt;/a&gt;: “I retain stock options in the company, which could bring me into conflict with The Times’s ethics standards. I also agreed to divest those options as quickly as I could, and certainly by the end of the year.” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/business/media/capitol-anthime-gionet-buzzfeed-vine.html"&gt;In January 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Smith again disclosed he still held some options).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gG21nz"&gt;In the meantime, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has been aggressively poaching BuzzFeed journalists. Besides Smith, the former editor-in-chief, and Warzel, who worked as an opinion columnist at &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;before launching his own subscription newsletter, Virginia Hughes, Davey Alba, Sheera Frenkel, and Sapna Maheshwari are among the more than 20 journalists the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;has lured away. Today, as BuzzFeed announced its SPAC deal, &lt;a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/ryan-mac-joining-technology-team/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;announced that it took one more&lt;/a&gt;: Ryan Mac, who recently won a Polk Award for his tech coverage. In the end, it seems an awful lot of the journalists who’d attempted to redefine journalism for the internet age defected to the stuffiest, most old-school journalism institution of them all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re on the Un-carrier, the N200 offers 5G and a high-quality screen for the right price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6BOFeg"&gt;The answer to whether you should buy the $239 OnePlus Nord N200 5G depends a lot on who your wireless carrier is. If you’re on T-Mobile — and thanks to a generous trade-in offer and a carrier exclusive, you probably are if you’re considering the N200 — then this is a fine, basic device that will allow you to take advantage of the company’s good 5G network at a very low price. The N200 5G will only work on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G networks, however, so if you’re with either of those carriers, it’s not your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z2160"&gt;Why does your carrier make such a difference? Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G networks aren’t great at the moment, so using the N200 as a 4G-only device isn’t actually a big deal right now. But they’ll start getting much better over the next couple of years thanks to some newly acquired spectrum, and when that happens, being stuck on LTE could become a real drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgNgq"&gt;The N200 5G has a few things going for it aside from 5G connectivity, starting with a big 5,000mAh battery. It has a large 6.5-inch display with a faster refresh rate that’s one of the best available in this class. You’ll also get three years of security updates, which isn’t &lt;em&gt;stellar&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but is an improvement over the two years more common among sub-$300 phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZaQMw8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10620908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQOFEo"&gt;On the downside, the camera system is basic. While overall phone performance is fine for day-to-day email and browsing, it’s a little slow with more processing-intensive tasks. And while you can get by on the 64GB of built-in storage, most people will need to add in the cost of a MicroSD card to their purchase for expanded storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OHbxB"&gt;The N200 is an acceptable, inexpensive 5G device, and it’s even a relatively good deal as a 4G device at the moment. But your mobile carrier and your inclination toward keeping your phone for more than one or two years makes recommending the N200 5G complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hF4edUedso0aYhx715Y3XtHFSZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677496/ajohnson_210623_4644_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200 5G is one of few devices in its class to offer a screen with 90Hz refresh rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cwU1sh"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sMDXOX"&gt;As far as screens on budget devices go, the N200 5G has one of the nicest out there. It’s a big 6.5-inch LCD panel with 1080p resolution, which is an upgrade from 720p that’s more typical in this class. It also stands out with a faster 90Hz refresh rate, making scrolling and animations look just a little smoother than usual. The screen is usable even in very bright, direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pP5DfO"&gt;The N200’s battery life is very good, thanks to a big 5,000mAh cell. It also supports 18W charging with the included wired charger — not &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;like OnePlus’ pricier devices&lt;/a&gt;, but good enough to take it from 12 percent to a full charge in about two hours. With moderate use I got two days out of the N200 before I dipped into low battery territory; a full day of heavy use should be no problem, and many will see it last well into the second day, if not longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oBPkla"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5gxBHT"&gt;The N200 uses a Snapdragon 480 5G processor, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;relatively new chipset designed for budget 5G phones&lt;/a&gt; like this one. It’s coupled with 4GB of RAM and keeps up well in day-to-day use switching apps and scrolling social media. It doesn’t take a lot to push it outside of its comfort zone where you’ll notice slight hesitations and stuttering, especially with intensive tasks like zooming in and out of Google Maps and starting navigation. But considering the price, it feels appropriately equipped to provide usable daily performance over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwKCyE"&gt;While you might be able to get by on the N200’s 64GB of built-in storage, it’s on the lower side and a healthy chunk of that is occupied by system files. Most people will need to add a MicroSD card for more space, so consider that extra $20 or so part of the overall cost of the phone unless you’re really frugal with your storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yjFr7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OAKrz"&gt;As noted above, the N200’s 5G connectivity works on T-Mobile, but on AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the phone is 4G-only. It supports sub-6GHz 5G only — no super-fast mmWave, but that’s not a big deal since it’s hard to find and T-Mobile doesn’t offer much of it. There’s also no support for the C-band spectrum that will be put to use for 5G starting early next year, but that would be a bigger deal if the phone could use AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon 5G. It can’t, so it’s not. What you do get access to is T-Mobile’s 5G sub-6 5G network, which is good and has broad coverage, even if it’s not mind-bogglingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTYZKp"&gt;Android 11 is loaded on the N200 out of the box, and OnePlus says it will provide one more major OS platform update during the phone’s life span. It will also get the aforementioned three years of security update support, which is a better-than-average policy for a budget Android phone. OnePlus’ implementation of Android is less fussy than most and is mercifully low on clutter and pre-downloaded apps. It’s a grown-up-looking interface that’s about as close as you’ll get to a “pure” Android experience outside of Google’s own Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHgFURqjsIIuX5f-FJa0V9wrf6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677497/ajohnson_210623_4644_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200’s main rear-facing camera uses a 13-megapixel sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vhpB9d"&gt;OnePlus N200 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m4NjF8"&gt;The N200’s camera performance is acceptable, if a bit disappointing even considering the phone’s price. Included are a 13-megapixel f/2.2 main camera, 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front there’s a 13-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3weoTJ"&gt;That 13-megapixel main camera will do fine for snapshots in good lighting, but it quickly reaches its limits with high-contrast scenes, like landscapes with deep shadows and bright highlights. Noise starts to creep into shots taken in moderate lighting conditions, like interiors, and dark scenes show a lot of smeared details and noise. Night mode works well enough to preserve a little more detail, but it’s only suitable for scenes without moving subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cnALW6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621086"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWs5CO"&gt;The N200’s camera system may be more of a disappointment considering that the higher-tier Nord N10 5G’s 64-megapixel camera is surprisingly good. The N10 costs $60 more than the N200 (a full 25 percent higher) so it’s not a totally fair comparison, but I can’t help feeling that the N200 could have been a little better equipped. Pixel count isn’t everything, but in this case, a newer, higher-resolution sensor would probably have made a significant difference in detail retention and its handling of high-contrast scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xsuqtRm9MA0ww26SXO3QNUW-LRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677495/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re on T-Mobile, the N200 is a good pick for a nice screen and 5G at a low price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XqudbD"&gt;If you’re considering the OnePlus N200 5G because T-Mobile is offering you a good deal on one, then I think there’s a good argument for this phone. It doesn’t offer a lot in the way of nice extras and features, but you will get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGDJZ"&gt;If you live in an area with poor T-Mobile 5G coverage, or you’re with another wireless carrier, then you’ll be better served by another option. You could save some money and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22213714/oneplus-n10-5g-n100-nord-north-american-release"&gt;go with the $179 4G-only N100&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a lot of the same features. The screen isn’t quite as detailed (720p vs. 1080p) but you still get that 90Hz refresh rate, big battery, and nice OnePlus user interface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NRBOsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you’ll get a good screen, long battery life, and a 5G device that should last a few years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABv6hi"&gt;On the other hand, if you can spend a little more, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung A32 5G is worth considering&lt;/a&gt;. The interface is more cluttered and its screen isn’t as nice with its 720p resolution and standard 60Hz refresh rate, but almost every other aspect of the device is meaningfully upgraded, from the camera to wider 5G compatibility to a stronger four-year security support policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2h8CDU"&gt;All of that said, if you’re comfortable with the N200’s shortcomings and you’re tempted by a sweet deal from T-Mobile, I won’t be the one to stand in your way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lucid Air is nearing the finish line</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZnUzk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;The Lucid Air&lt;/a&gt; has been in the works for a very long time, nearly a decade by some accounts. The first time I rode in the 1,000-horsepower electric sedan was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/9/14186108/lucid-motors-air-electric-car-ride-along-ces-2017"&gt;in Las Vegas in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when Lucid Motors had an engineering prototype on hand at the Consumer Electronics Show. I rode in the Air again just this past Monday, in a near-final version of the massive, roomy vehicle. Suffice to say, it was better the second time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rshbcg"&gt;In the four years between then and now, the EV startup struggled to raise money and very nearly went out of business. But thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;timely investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund&lt;/a&gt;, in which it put up its own intellectual property as collateral, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;recent SPAC deal&lt;/a&gt; that will leave the company with $4.4 billion in cash, Lucid Motors is now on track to starting delivering its first EVs to customers later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AUjuC6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I rode in the Grand Touring version of the Lucid Air&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oRU2lb"&gt;In advance of that, the company is opening up design studios (just don’t call ‘em dealerships) in bustling neighborhoods around the country, in the hopes that the reopening economy and increased foot traffic will send more EV-curious customers their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vub8Pz"&gt;I rode in the Grand Touring version of the Lucid Air, the second highest level trim with just 800-horsepower and a starting price of $139,000. The company says that this version, with its 113kWh battery pack, will get up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21358613/lucid-motor-air-electric-vehicle-ev-range-517-miles"&gt;517 miles of range&lt;/a&gt; on a single charge, which is really just an unfathomable amount of battery power. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENVOgNI20WLtwK6b-q7CTpE3XTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677729/ahawkins_210623_4646_0007.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NsLf9X"&gt;Just like last time, I came away impressed with the car’s acceleration, which should come as no surprise. Pretty much every EV on the road today has near instantaneous torque, and trying to compare one EV’s acceleration to another has become a bit of a joke. Lucid said the Air can sprint from 0 to 60mph in two seconds, while Tesla says the Model S Plaid can do it in under two seconds. Can you tell the difference? Of course not. And there are so many caveats involved in both claims that it hardly seems worth mentioning. Did the electric car go fast? Yes it did.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWoddB"&gt;The exterior design hasn’t changed much from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15052752/lucid-motors-air-electric-car-alpha-photos"&gt;alpha prototype we saw in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. With its rounded edges, low-slung stance, and dramatic glass roof, the Air makes a great first impression — which is exactly what Derek Jenkins, the former Mazda designer and Lucid’s senior vice president of design and brand, is hoping for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd8lNR"&gt;After all, Lucid is about to run head first into a very competitive market. The luxury EV segment is already crowded with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;Audi E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13628872/jaguar-ipace-concept-electric-car-suv-unveiled-la-auto-show-2016-photos"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt;. Other vehicles are soon to follow, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes-Benz EQS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;BMW i4&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357789/lexus-lf-z-electrified-concept-car-ev-toyota-electric"&gt;Lexus LF-Z&lt;/a&gt;. And don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Model S Plaid&lt;/a&gt;, which started rolling out to customers earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JwOSRf-GZKjIzRQDP_pOX8qvio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677726/ahawkins_210623_4646_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BQagPW"&gt;Under direction of the former Model S lead engineer Peter Rawlinson, then Lucid Motors’ CTO, now its CEO, there is a sense in the automotive world that Lucid has the internal knowledge and technical chops to tease Tesla’s grip as maker of the ultimate electric luxury sedan. It seems as if every electric vehicle that’s released these days is inevitably held up against Tesla for a comparison. But few electric vehicles have actually Tesla DNA running through their bloodstream. The Lucid Air is one of those vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcBN5O"&gt;“Model S is obviously a pivotal vehicle,” Jenkins said. “This car is going to offer a lot more space, a lot more comfort, nicer material, trim, cargo... I just think it’s a more luxury-focused product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzsFOA"&gt;The interior of the Air is simple without straying into minimalist territory. The main feature is a 34-inch, high-resolution 5K horizontal curved display which starts to the left of the steering wheel and stretches to the middle of the dash. A second, retractable screen known as the “Pilot Panel” sits above the center console. And with the touch of a button, the screen folds away neatly into the dash, revealing some extra cargo space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="l5xXIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I just think it’s a more luxury-focused product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UrH9dk"&gt;The two screens can interact with each other, too. Jenkins demonstrated how items on the main screen can be “swiped” down on to the Pilot Panel for further perusal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkOTzl"&gt;“We really wanted to get back to just a simple, elegant screen dedicated for the driver to make the driver experience awesome,” he said. “And then have a nice panel that’s for both driver and passenger, and make sure there’s still a relationship between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csBmLhSng9YeZgr-AvS17J_aBHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677738/ahawkins_210623_4646_0015.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LBOVTq"&gt;The ride itself was fine, with the Air’s suspension (which is not air suspension, but conventional springs and active shocks) handling itself well on the cobblestone streets. Despite its wider than average stance, the sedan was able to slip in and out of some tight spaces with relative ease. And while traffic in Manhattan was generally pretty terrible, the driver did get the opportunity to demonstrate the acceleration when the cars cleared momentarily on the West Side Highway. (Reader, I woo’d.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aofTBA"&gt;Lucid’s retail strategy — opening studios in areas with heavy foot traffic — is smart, but the company will still run into headwinds as it tries to navigate the legal landscape. Dozens of states have laws on the books that protect car dealerships and &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/03/22/electric-vehicles-direct-sales-dealerships-evs/"&gt;prevent direct-to-consumer sales by automotive newcomers&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has managed to get by with some exemptions, and Lucid is hoping to piggyback on that success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9oW2z"&gt;“In each state, it’s either allowed or allowed with conditions,” said Zak Edson, Lucid’s senior director of retail operations. “We’re working with local authorities to try to find a way to make it allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8atn3ox0auR1Un5FJuAcbBrFz4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677733/ahawkins_210623_4646_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zo4Pd1"&gt;New York is one such state that bars a manufacturer from selling cars directly to customers. As such, anyone visiting the company’s Manhattan studio will be directed to make a reservation online, and when they actually take delivery, the car will likely come from another state, like Illinois, which allows direct-to-consumer sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PItudm"&gt;The New York studio is Lucid’s seventh, with Chicago, Boston, and Phoenix locations slated to open by year’s end, and 21 total by mid-2022. Lucid plans to open service and delivery centers to support each showroom, including one in New Jersey for New York-area owners. The majority of Lucid’s service calls will be handled by mobile technicians, with Edson predicting that “80 percent” of repairs will be handled in customer driveways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2AJtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was a herculean effort to get to this point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CBMM7X"&gt;Lucid had previously said it would start making deliveries in the spring of 2021, but that’s been delayed to later this year. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21739985/lucid-motors-ev-factory-construction-arizona"&gt;finished the first phase&lt;/a&gt; of its $700 million factory in Arizona late last year, and has built over 100 vehicles so far. “We are already producing cars at the factory, with the focus on ensuring the highest possible quality for a high-end luxury brand,” a spokesperson said. Next year, the company plans to unveil an SUV, codenamed “Project Gravity,” which won’t go on sale until 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxfgJ5"&gt;It was a herculean effort to get to this point, and Lucid very nearly didn’t make it. Starting a new car company from scratch is nearly impossible to do, as evidenced by Tesla’s several close brushes with total disaster. Lucid was no different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjvUaX"&gt;It’s not a guarantee that Lucid will succeed and the Air will become the new Model S. There’s no question that the company is about to reach an important milestone. But everything else is still up in the air. &lt;/p&gt;
