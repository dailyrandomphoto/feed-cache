    <title>I do not understand this chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVDeK5-Ff3m8sDc8T5hJIpTPS4g=/207x0:2103x1264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325068/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_2.12.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjR97U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Stevens/status/1395447923463245824"&gt;It started with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Tim Stevens. A picture of a chair that seemed to effortlessly skim the line between office chair, La-Z-Boy recliner, and Victorian throne. An utter affront to design, taste, and style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWUDDx"&gt;This chair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sZZa0W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Stumbled across this chair online today. I find its middle-management, aspirational evil overlord aesthetic oddly chilling. &lt;a href="https://t.co/0I41mxQNjF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0I41mxQNjF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Stevens (@Tim_Stevens) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Stevens/status/1395447923463245824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ALNW"&gt;The tweet first crossed my timeline yesterday, and my mind has been consumed for the past 24 hours by the very existence of this chair. Why does it exist? Has anyone actually bought one? Does the chair come with a menacing-looking cat to hold when spinning around to fire your minions? Are you required to shout “I’ll get you next time, Gadget?” when you encounter minor setbacks while seated in it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GyluF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Penn-Executive-Office-Chair-Reclining/dp/B08XQTF8SW/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Wood+Executive+Chair&amp;amp;qid=1621612598&amp;amp;sr=8-6&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Amazon listing&lt;/a&gt;, however, only added to the perplexing nature. The original picture, for example, did not convey the &lt;em&gt;built-in footrest&lt;/em&gt; that this relic possesses. It’s a fact that seems important, although I cannot quite convey why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLntpN"&gt;Another important nugget of information: the Penn Executive Chair’s price, a whopping $1,950, puts it above the cost of the most expensive office chair from Herman Miller or the cushiest, comfiest La-Z-Boy recliner. Then again, why shouldn’t a chair like this, which aspires to ascend beyond the limits of both of those products, feature a price tag that similarly soars above either of its lesser halves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F31is"&gt;(That said, this thing does feature genuine leather, the lowest grade of leather, a disappointing choice for something this pricey.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1F3YgZ04ccFgoLkxyCYQuNKvHdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531202/81lXq9NCVKL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgkpej"&gt;The main vibe of that image is “spikes and manacles are about to pop out of the arm and headrests to imprison a James Bond-style spy in a low-budget (or lowish-budget, again these chairs cost like two grand) thriller movie.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoCEvE"&gt;The rabbit hole tunneled ever deeper. I found the &lt;a href="https://www.pennexecutivechairs.com/"&gt;website of the manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, Penn Executive Chairs, showcasing new styles of the dreaded chair in ever-maddening color schemes, patterns, and tufted leather backs. A second image — the only one I’ve found of a human sitting in one of these chairs — alludes to the scale, one that seems more fitting for a throne than a seat for an office desk. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L2uBKq2NtvXi8AXsRe5xQb2SODU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531193/66036e_bf709998d2394edfa837f70b02510ffd_mv2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYUVSaPpIJcQh-qr9zgpYnr85Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531191/66036e_33d959332384427799fc704d1a52a770_mv2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENJOY THE BUSINESS– NETWORKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bsv0ES"&gt;I do not think writing this has helped me understand the chair — indeed, I don’t think it is possible to truly &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the nature of this item — but if a giant throne-like recliner shows up as my new desk chair whenever we all return to office life, this is why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PuVVN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the features I actually want from my pregnancy tracking app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Diana Diller and Pregnancy data" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqNY_rV2YH7F-ohdrPmHpvzzf8E=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324685/1139388741.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pregnancy apps could use some new features.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Philip Cheung for The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7wvV3q"&gt;A great scholar once noted that “there’s an app for that.” Pregnancy is no exception. I use my phone to manage just about everything else in my life, so when I found out I was pregnant, it was a natural next step to go looking for an app to hold my hand through the experience. I’ve been using a couple of popular apps interchangeably — &lt;a href="https://info.oviahealth.com/join"&gt;Ovia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/mobile-app/"&gt;What to Expect&lt;/a&gt; — and generally, they’re pretty good. But I have notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5QYOS"&gt;So without further ado, here’s a list of demands from me, a pregnant lady with no app development experience, to the pregnancy app creators of the world. It’s the impractical pregnancy tracking app of my dreams. And believe it or not, you can use these ideas for free in your next update. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NWmzWi"&gt;A nap alarm that sends a push notification to the other inhabitants of my house to not disturb me when I set it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6GMwXT"&gt;A shortcut to order a Popeyes chicken sandwich on DoorDash with priority delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ksUoul"&gt;A hotline to call when I know I’m being unreasonably emotional but need to cry about something trivial that happened, like “The pharmacist was a little short with me,” or “I just really need to eat a Frosty right now and I’m miles away from the nearest Wendy’s.” My spouse does not need this kind of added stress in his life right now, and I just need a virtual shoulder to cry on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nU1Yxq"&gt;Fetal size comparisons to fast-food menu items. Speak my language, please! I do not know how large a mille-feuille is (and I’ve even seen &lt;em&gt;Bake Off&lt;/em&gt;!), but I know exactly how large a McDonald’s chicken nugget is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HJ1wNL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re not eating for two!” The &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; I’m not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YUD0wX"&gt;Zero mentions of healthy snack recipes, excessive weight gain warnings, or, god forbid, the phrase “You’re not eating for two!” The &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; I’m not. My body is literally creating a whole-ass human from scratch. Sometimes I’m just exhausted, sick of eating baby carrots with hummus, and my soul needs the kind of soothing only a bowl of peanut M&amp;amp;Ms can provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FPQ065"&gt;Push notifications for useful things, like when I actually need to start shopping for a crib or a stroller. In fact, just pick one for me and schedule a Target pickup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3lLUi1"&gt;A “good vibes only” community forum. I like being able to connect with other pregnant people who are due around the same time, but reading about complications in other people’s pregnancies sends me into a worry spiral that I just don’t need right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JV2Dvy"&gt;Daily affirmations that I’m doing fine and whatever food or beverage item I’m worried about putting in my body is probably fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JEGUDm"&gt;Fellow armchair app developers: did I miss anything? Let me know in the comments — just, you know, good vibes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnUK7u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1V5bbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An online community’s shared stories against anti-Asian hate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elizabeth Kari at the AAP(I Belong) exhibition at the Museum of Chinese in America in New York City." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gwlGIfVHEaoUaPBAK1sUdX_Pzyc=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324632/solo_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A video of her mom’s assault went viral — now she wants to tell a different story about anti-Asian hate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="g7tSsb"&gt;After tucking her mom in for the night, Elizabeth Kari found herself scrolling through comments on her GoFundMe campaign well past 3AM. She had started the campaign to raise money for her mom’s recovery from a now-infamous assault that took place in New York City and to support community groups and other survivors of anti-Asian hate. Soon, people were sending more than donations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7WusY"&gt;Some comments shared stories of being brutally attacked, similar to her mother’s. Other heartfelt messages referred to Kari’s mom as “Auntie” or “Tita,” which are terms of respect and endearment for elders in the Filipino community. “You and your mom Vilma make me proud to be an American and a New Yorker,” one comment from April says. “She looks like my mom and it could be any of our mom if we don’t defeat hate crimes and get rid of racism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o7T8A7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How great it would be to bundle up my inbox in a sense, and share it with the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bNDyJq"&gt;“I thought, like, ‘Wow, this is so amazing,’” Kari tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It empowered me, it kept me positive. Every time I faltered a little bit, or got tired, or upset, I would open this GoFundMe,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvz5PF"&gt;It was a welcome change from the exhausting stream of headlines about her mom and other recent incidents of violence against Asian Americans. “It almost makes you kind of want to curl into a ball a little bit more,” Kari tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. To shift the narrative, she started her own storytelling initiative this month called AAP(I Belong).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebG4jr"&gt;After reading the stories on her GoFundMe page, Kari launched a &lt;a href="https://aapibelong.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where people who have experienced anti-Asian hatred can anonymously share “stories and words of encouragement.” She works in fashion and says this is the first time she’s ever undertaken a project like this. Some of the stories are now adorning the walls of the Museum of Chinese in America in New York City. It’s part of an exhibition that’s open until May 22nd during Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. After the exhibition closes, she says she plans to share selected stories online on the AAP(I Belong) website and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/aapibelong/"&gt;Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64N2qT"&gt;“I thought, how great it would be to bundle up my inbox in a sense, and share it with the world,” Kari says. “I could give back to a community all this energy and love they gave to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elizabeth Kari (right) and her mother (Vilma) visited the AAP(I Belong) exhibition at the Museum of Chinese in America together one night before it opened." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Sd3flU3O-UMACZB_XhAelf5PtA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530947/DSC03946__2_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Kari (right) and her mother Vilma (left) visited the AAP(I Belong) exhibition at the Museum of Chinese in America together one night before it opened. “I had chills and a bit of a smile I couldn’t hold back because it was so weird,” Elizabeth says. “Stepping back and actually seeing it and being ready to open the doors was just a very big moment of relief.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BUJR9R"&gt;The outpouring of support came after a video of Kari’s mother, Vilma Kari, went viral a couple months ago. In the footage, a man suddenly kicks Vilma in the stomach as she’s walking past a building. After she falls to the ground, he stomps her in the face three times before walking away. The video sparked outrage, not only because of the violence, but because a bystander can be seen in the footage shutting the door after the incident, leaving Vilma on the ground outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI6XSz"&gt;The name of Kari’s new initiative, “AAP(I) Belong,” is a response to what the man told her mom that day, according to Kari. “He had said, ‘You don’t belong here’ before he assaulted her. So I wanted to kind of use that as a cornerstone of my project and reclaim that word, [belong],” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJRSEe"&gt;Kari also wanted to clear up one misconception that emerged in the media storm that followed the video: that her mom was left to fend for herself after the assault. “What this video did not capture was that there was someone who was standing across the street that witnessed my mom getting attacked who yelled and screamed to get the assailant’s attention,” she writes on the GoFundMe page. “This gesture of action is what we need in our world right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="357JuT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What this video did not capture”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8A6Iya"&gt;What happened to Kari’s mom is part of a rise in violence against Asian Americans that has rocked the community over the past year. Hate crimes against Asian Americans skyrocketed by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-nearly-150-2020-mostly-n-n1260264"&gt;150 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. That year, former President Donald Trump continued the long &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196100/immigration-borders-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;history of using immigrants as scapegoats&lt;/a&gt; for epidemics, repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9578992/donald-trump-chinese-virus-racist-comment-coronavirus"&gt;using racist terms like “China virus” and “Kung Flu”&lt;/a&gt; when talking about COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHFLew"&gt;“We know that people will look at our black hair and ‘yellow’ skin and target us… There’s a lot of anger, a lot of resentment, and also a lot of dread to know that when we go out, we could be subject to racism,” Erin Wen Ai Chew, a 37-year-old with Chinese ancestry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121358/coronavirus-racism-social-media-east-asian-chinese-xenophobia"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last February as prejudice against Asian Americans mounted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ko1iDD"&gt;Advocacy groups rallied last year to take stock of what was happening. In March 2020, several groups came together to create the Stop AAPI Hate reporting center to track hate incidents. More than a year later, their work is still grueling. The group documented &lt;a href="https://stopaapihate.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stop-AAPI-Hate-Report-National-210506.pdf"&gt;6,603 hate incidents&lt;/a&gt; — mostly verbal harassment, but also physical assault, civil rights violations, and online harassment — between March 2020 and March 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbGKSH"&gt;AAP(I Belong) has the potential to paint a fuller picture of what Asian Americans are facing, says Kevin Nadal, an author and professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and Graduate Center at the City University of New York. There are gaps in police reports because of cultural, language, or bureaucratic barriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHab2O"&gt;Kari hopes that by creating a place where people can share their experiences anonymously, she might also encourage them to report those incidents. “One of the biggest things that my mom felt with this incident was, ‘Why me?’ But also, ‘Okay, this happened to me — how many other people have experienced this and didn’t have the resources, or the help, or the support, or, you know, video footage?” Kari says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TCVvwA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How many other people have experienced this and didn’t have the resources, or the help, or the support, or, you know, video footage?” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gzuSrP"&gt;“When you’re targeted by violence, that might feel shaming or that you’re bringing some sort of stigma to yourself and your family,” Nadal says. “They might not want to report hate violence incidents just because it’s a lot of hassle. They might question, for what? To have to go through the process of reporting to several people and sharing your story over and over again when in reality there may not be any justice that you may gain from all of this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcqykq"&gt;There was no justice after the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2021/03/27/981718272/how-vincent-chins-death-gave-others-a-voice"&gt;1982 murder of Vincent Chin&lt;/a&gt;. Chin was beaten to death with a baseball bat by two white auto workers during growing resentment in the US over competition from Japanese carmakers (even though Chin was Chinese American). One of Chin’s assailants was cleared of all charges, while the other was eventually acquitted in a retrial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDlbQH"&gt;That case became a rallying point for Asians in America who have since fought for more protection and recognition within the judicial system and outside of it. Storytelling plays a big role in that movement. The 1987 documentary &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/who-killed-vincent-chin-documentary-anti-asian-violence_n_6054aa02c5b6bd95117c9980"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Killed Vincent Chin?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a film classic directed by Asian American women, has become a grassroots organizing tool often screened during informal teach-ins. Not long after the film was made, the nonprofit Asian American Writers’ Workshop was founded in New York City. It considers itself a &lt;a href="https://aaww.org/about-us/"&gt;“community of activists”&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on “taking stories from the margins and pushing them to the center.” The AAP(I Belong) website adds to that tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvjA3m"&gt;“Using our own language is more empowering — but it’s also better data, it’s more informational. You’re sharing the lived experiences of the people who are actually from those communities who are actually surviving and thriving through many different obstacles,” Nadal says. “Previously, people of historically marginalized groups — especially Black, Indigenous, Asian people, Latinx folks — we were told stories about us, written from colonizers’ or settlers’ perspective, as opposed to using our own language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="84vkqi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Using our own language is more empowering — but it’s also better data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DFfp7V"&gt;Mainstream narratives around hate crimes have been used to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22321234/black-asian-american-tensions-solidarity-history"&gt;sow division between Black and Asian communities and other historically marginalized groups&lt;/a&gt;. Social media was rife with “dehumanizing” language used to describe the man who assaulted Kari’s mom, Nadal says. “It was also something that the media kind of perpetuated like, ‘Here’s a photo of this larger Black man who is just out of jail and killed his mother and now he’s attacking this innocent Asian Filipino woman,’” he says. “Those are things that I find to be problematic because when it comes to these anti Asian American hate crimes, we don’t really hear a lot about the white assailants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRDFno"&gt;Storytelling projects like Kari’s, on the other hand, can bring people together. That’s an important point for Kari, who is multiracial. After her mom was assaulted, organizers reached out to Kari with photos from rallies to stop Asian hate. “I looked at the pictures, it’s really like a sea of all types of people,” Kari says. “It’s really beautiful to see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NlGmZT"&gt;Kari says she’s received some 200 submissions so far for the AAP(I Belong) website. She and her mom pored through them to choose which ones to add to the gallery exhibition that’s open this week. “She’s just happy that while she’s healing she has this,” Kari says. “It’s nice I think for her that there’s a project, something good coming out of the bad so when people talk to us it’s not as fixated on or as associated with her attack. It’s more about this healing process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbdAaf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxg9w9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter labels some Indian politicians’ tweets about COVID-19 as manipulated media</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;India’s government has criticized Twitter for applying its “manipulated media” label to some Indian politicians’ tweets about COVID-19 efforts, and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Indian news &lt;a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.opindia.com/2021/05/govt-slams-twitter-for-labeling-congress-toolkit-tweets-manipulated-media-meity/"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday. The government has asked Twitter to remove the tags out of “fairness and equity,” saying the application of the labels affects the platform’s image as “neutral and unbiased.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68PiW7"&gt;The government sent the notice to Twitter two days after it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1395714092837457931?s=20"&gt;applied the “manipulated media” label&lt;/a&gt; to a tweet by Sambit Patra, of India’s ruling BJP party. Patra said in the tweet, which appears to have been deleted (it’s not clear whether Twitter removed it or if Patra deleted it himself), that opposition party Congress had used a “toolkit” in attempts to subvert the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKkB36"&gt;The BJP party accuses the Congress party of creating the toolkit to damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-the-congress-toolkit-controversy-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/82761578.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, but the Congress party claims the version of the toolkit the BJP is spreading is a faked version of a research note about an unrelated project.  &lt;a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/"&gt;Indian fact-checking organization &lt;em&gt;Alt News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found images of the so-called “COVID toolkit” that Patra and others had tweeted contained some falsified information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzI35U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257"&gt;According to Indian news site &lt;em&gt;The News Minute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Patra’s tweet read: “Friends look at the #CongressToolKit in extending help to the needy during the Pandemic! More of a PR exercise with the help of Friendly Journalists &amp;amp; Influencers than a soulful endeavour. Read for yourselves the agenda of the Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiN2WA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter introduced its manipulated media policy last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AmNwcM"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Friday. The platform &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-approach-to-synthetic-and-manipulated-media.html"&gt;introduced its manipulated media policy&lt;/a&gt; last February, which applies to media that is “significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated.” Video clips or images that have been altered to change their meaning or context could get a label under the rules, and false content presented as true or content found to be “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm” could be removed entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8CLes"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;Several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/trump-tweet-label-video/"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; by former US President Donald Trump, who has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, received the manipulated media label last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RDUdx"&gt;Twitter has grappled with local legal requirements in India, particularly with regard to content about the coronavirus pandemic. Late last month, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;removed more than 50 tweets critical&lt;/a&gt; of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic there, at the government’s request. The censored accounts included a sitting member of Parliament and other prominent figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76ZZ3L"&gt;And during protests by farmers in India in February, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/india-twitter.html"&gt;Twitter permanently blocked&lt;/a&gt; more than 500 accounts and removed others from being visible within the country. At the time, the Indian government issued a notice of noncompliance to Twitter, which could have meant jail time for Twitter’s employees in India if the company had refused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGyO25"&gt;According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;India reported&lt;/a&gt; 259,551 new cases of COVID-19 and 4,209 new deaths on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Amazon union case has come down to a mailbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-POLITICS-LABOR-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4DHL2B5fEm9giUqVClDdVbzeMb0=/0x0:5154x3436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324220/1232001976.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vW8zMc"&gt;For months during the union drive, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, felt like they were being watched. There were cameras around BHM1, the 855,000-square-foot warehouse where workers sorted, scanned, and packed boxes. A uniformed police officer patrolled the parking lot all hours of the day and night. Managers came up to peoples’ workstations to ask how they felt about the organizing campaign. So when Amazon had a new USPS mailbox installed — ostensibly to increase voter turnout — many felt they couldn’t trust it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRvtR3"&gt;“Amazon said only the post office had access to it, but that’s not how it felt,” said Serena Wallace, an employee BHM1 who testified on behalf of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). “I avoided the mailbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y9MFzN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon is trying to paint RWDSU as living in fantasy land&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9dvBwT"&gt;Wallace’s comments came during a National Labor Relations Board hearing, where the union is contesting the results of the election it lost in early April. Like most court proceedings, it is both theatrical and crushingly boring. RWDSU is trying to convince the labor board to throw out the results of the vote by proving Amazon violated US labor law. Amazon is trying to paint RWDSU as living in fantasy land, refusing to admit that workers simply do not want a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZFcI"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Amazon spokesperson said: “Despite heavy campaigning from union officials, policymakers, and even some media outlets, our employees overwhelmingly rejected the union’s representation. Rather than accepting that choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda. We look forward to continuing to present the facts of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNovWS"&gt;During the first week of the hearing, the union brought up workers to testify about &lt;a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/rwdsu/pages/764/attachments/original/1618837432/Union's_Objections_to_the_Election__10-RC-269250.pdf?1618837432"&gt;each of its 23 objections&lt;/a&gt;. One of these workers was Hope Pendleton — an employee at BHM1. Pendleton said she attended a captive audience meeting in February where she was told that her benefits and health insurance could be taken away if the union drive was successful. The anti-union messaging was relentless, Pendleton explained. “It was a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ct3ql"&gt;Employees said Amazon texted them multiple times a day with anti-union messages. “Don’t let outsiders divide our winning team,” read one, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1357797923598262280/photo/2"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The union may accept fewer benefits for you in return for taking dues directly out of your check and sending them directly to the union.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrl1bm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What have you ever done for me?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KsTwsj"&gt;Kristine Bell, another worker at BHM1, said she attended a meeting where Amazon managers handed out car tags with anti-union messages like “leave RWDSU in the rear view” and “Vote no.” When a manager asked Bell how she felt about the union, she said she felt good. “But it’ll change the way we communicate and what I can do for you,” the manager allegedly responded. “What have you ever done for me?” Bell asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we3yxg"&gt;Workers testified that they were told that the union would take away their voice and that they wouldn’t be able to speak to managers if they had concerns in the workplace. (This is false; unionized workers can of course still raise concerns to managers.) Amazon’s broader message was clear: the union would come in between the company and its employees — and leave workers worse off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlDaAI"&gt;The barrage of communications made some workers feel pressured and monitored. Voting was supposed to be anonymous — but the constant surveillance made some doubt that was possible. If they supported the union, would Amazon know? Could they lose their jobs in retaliation? The atmosphere grew more tense as the vote drew near. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BUc2s4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If RWDSU can demonstrate that employees &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; the company held sway over the vote, it could be enough to overturn the results&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jSVgOM"&gt;The environment workers describe here is critical for the proceedings. The union doesn’t need to prove that Amazon had access to how people voted or manipulated the results. If RWDSU can demonstrate that employees &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; the company held sway over the vote, it could be enough to overturn the results, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/amazon-had-key-to-usps-mailbox-used-for-union-vote-witness-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJeXkQ"&gt;That’s why so much of the case hinges on the mailbox. Employees who testified during the hearing say they were suspicious about its providence — particularly when Amazon erected a tent around it with signs that read “Speak for yourself!” and “Mail your ballot here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YdkLV"&gt;Witness testimony also alleged that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-14/amazon-had-key-to-usps-mailbox-used-for-union-vote-witness-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Amazon security guards had access to the mailbox&lt;/a&gt; and were seen opening it on at least one occasion. RWDSU even presented emails showing that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/amazon-exec-dave-clark-pushed-for-mailbox-in-alabama-union-election.html"&gt;Amazon executive Dave Clark supported the mailbox installation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJmkV"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson said the company only had access to incoming mail addressed to the building. “As we’ve said from the start, this mailbox was secure and Amazon had no access to outgoing mail. Similar to any other mailbox that serves businesses, we had access only to the incoming mailbox where we received mail addressed to the building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQk5jC"&gt;During cross-examination, Amazon’s lawyers tried to get workers to say they hadn’t been forced to use the mailbox, regardless of what it looked like. Here’s an exchange between an attorney for the online retail giant and Darryl Johnson, a BHM1 employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bj39n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; You understood that you could mail your ballot at any mailbox in the Birmingham area, and to the extent that anyone wanted to use that mailbox, that was their choice, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtEbtG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson: &lt;/strong&gt;You could say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dut6CG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon never required employees to use that BHM1 mailbox to mail their ballot, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rItxA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson: &lt;/strong&gt;You mean&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;did they tell employees to use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SG4Qo0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; No, did they require it? Did they command it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08IUuN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnson:&lt;/strong&gt; You could say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PkOsoW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; The mailbox was a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LgrUOR"&gt;Sounds like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7falf1"&gt;“Even though the NLRB definitively denied Amazon’s request for a dropbox on the warehouse property, Amazon felt it was above the law and worked with the postal service anyway to install one,” said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum &lt;a href="https://www.rwdsu.info/amazon_illegally_interfered_in_union_vote_rwdsu_to_file_objections_and_related_ulp_charges_to_hold_amazon_accountable_for_their_actions"&gt;in a previously published statement&lt;/a&gt;. “They did this because it provided a clear ability to intimidate workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qaYp8"&gt;Amazon’s lawyers have suggested that the mailbox was just an option; no workers were required to use it. But the pressure-cooker atmosphere that workers described during the hearing suggests otherwise. Whether that will be enough to convince the labor board to throw out the results of the election is anyone’s guess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAk2Tt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZUSKR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Apple TV 4K lets you play any TV audio through a HomePod</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pnB1aCr1PINh7qb269C4LjovO0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69324126/jbareham_180202_2266_0089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IoIl6l"&gt;Apple might have discontinued the original, full-size HomePod smart speaker, but the company is continuing to add new functionality to it. The latest one relies on you also buying the new, second-generation Apple TV 4K, however. If you own both products, there’s now built-in support for HDMI ARC and eARC, which lets the HomePod play audio from other devices plugged into your TV — not just an Apple TV streaming box. Gaming consoles should work; same goes for Blu-ray players or even another streaming gadget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv22Xu"&gt;The feature can be &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/play-audio-from-tv-inputs-homepod-apple-tv/"&gt;enabled in the “video and audio” area&lt;/a&gt; of the Apple TV settings menu. There you’ll see a field labeled “Audio Return Channel (beta),” where you can tell the Apple TV to route all television audio through HomePod speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNZn0V"&gt;I haven’t tested this yet, so I can’t speak to any latency issues that could negate its appeal for gaming, but it’s nice to see the HomePod gaining new tricks even after Apple has officially brought an end to sales of the product. (You can still find them at retailers including Apple itself.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2fWzyc"&gt;This continued evolution of home theater features is also a hint that Apple could have more speakers in the pipeline. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported last month that the company is in the early stages of development on a product that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379470/apple-tv-homepod-speaker-camera-video-call-soundbar-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;combines an Apple TV, speaker, and camera&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the $99 HomePod Mini stands as the lone smart speaker that Apple is actively marketing. Unfortunately, that device does not support the new audio return channel feature described above. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fisker is building an electric popemobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bqb3rmpmwB9AQRpxOmgKd7TjfO4=/46x0:2686x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69323983/PF_rendering_p4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fisker Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yRe00V"&gt;EV startup Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://investors.fiskerinc.com/news/news-details/2021/Fisker-Set-to-Make-First-All-electric-Papal-Transport/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it will make the first all-electric popemobile, using a modified version of its forthcoming Ocean SUV. Automotive designer Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker (his wife and Fisker Inc. co-founder) presented Pope Francis with images of the proposed design during a meeting at the Vatican on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouqWcJ"&gt;Those images show a white Ocean SUV with a glass cupola on top that would let the pope greet the public. The company says it will deliver the vehicle sometime next year. (The regular version of the Ocean SUV is supposed to launch near the end of 2022.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="waGMmw"&gt;Traditionally, the official popemobiles are made by Mercedes-Benz and have to be properly armored and outfitted with bulletproof glass. It’s not clear exactly how the Vatican would use Fisker Inc.’s electric SUV; messages to the Holy See’s press office were not immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rVVHVo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Vatican has used electric and hybrid vehicles before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7A0yds"&gt;Still, the pope rides in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/popemobiles-pope-francis-rode-in-year-2019-12#the-pope-also-rode-in-a-carbon-neutral-hydrogen-powered-toyota-mirai-around-japan-during-his-visit-in-november-according-to-the-associated-press-8"&gt;all sorts of modified vehicles&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-evolution-of-the-popemobile-5054965"&gt;his travels&lt;/a&gt; and has even used electric zero-emissions cars. The Vatican was gifted &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19508637"&gt;a Renault Kangoo electric van in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, but they were used for less official transport, like tooling around the Papal Palace in summer. Pope Francis was driven around in a hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai in Japan in 2019. Mercedes-Benz has even made hybrid popemobiles for his holiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty5U0I"&gt;However the Vatican decides to use the vehicle, here are some very funny photoshopped images of Pope Francis riding in the modified Ocean provided by Fisker Inc., including one where it looks like the holy father is falling over (perhaps thanks to the electric SUV’s instant torque?): &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uyka3jgtCMi5R5ZxumtSoGZgr0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530877/rear_pic.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SPjcjS3Kl9ewM3GiaYikeQGygs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22530876/PF_rendering_p4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K5bk3J"&gt;Henrik Fisker is known for designing Aston Martins, the BMW Z8, and for a brief stint at Tesla during some of its earliest years. He left Tesla to start a company called Fisker Automotive, where he designed a hybrid sports car called Karma. But the company ran into a lot of trouble with the batteries that powered the car, and it ultimately went bankrupt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJi34o"&gt;He founded Fisker Inc. in 2016 and was originally giving the idea of a sports car another go — though all-electric this time around. Fisker has since pivoted his new startup away from that idea and toward far more affordable and supposedly sustainable electric SUVs. The company recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac"&gt;went public in a SPAC merger and raised nearly $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and it has struck a deal with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; to build an even smaller more affordable “personal electric vehicle.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAbbs0"&gt;“I got inspired reading that Pope Francis is very considerate about the environment and the impact of climate change for future generations,” Fisker said in a statement. “The interior of the Fisker Ocean papal transport will contain a variety of sustainable materials, including carpets made from recycled plastic bottles from the ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citizen CEO offered to personally fund LA arson manhunt — for the wrong person</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘We make this sort of heinous crime impossible to escape from’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yZ0mhG"&gt;As wildfires raged through Southern California last weekend, an app called Citizen offered an unorthodox bounty over livestream and in push alerts to local residents: “hunt down” the alleged arsonist, and we’ll give you $30,000 cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FarmHW"&gt;In the hours that followed, it became clear the app was mistaken. The man pictured had no connection to the fires, and once he was located by law enforcement, he was quickly released for lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtSRlH"&gt;“We are actively working to improve our internal processes to ensure this does not occur again,” the company said in a statement after the release. “This was a mistake we are taking very seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6p6a8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are safety and we make this sort of heinous crime impossible to escape from. That needs to be our mindset.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3MS9ww"&gt;But according to internal communications obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the bounty was personally mandated by Citizen founder and CEO Andrew Frame, who saw it as an opportunity to exercise the app’s policing powers and even offered to fund it with his own money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFsufs"&gt;On Saturday afternoon, before the livestream was broadcast, Frame wrote in a company Slack thread that he would pay a $10,000 reward personally to catch an arsonist still in the area “as a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmj3YQ"&gt;“Let’s find this guy, activate safety network completely,” Frame wrote, according to screenshots of internal Slack messages obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a great transition of Citizen back to active safety. We are not a news company. We are safety and we make this sort of heinous crime impossible to escape from. That needs to be our mindset.” The bounty was later raised to $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abzs21"&gt;First released under the name Vigilante in 2016, Citizen had a rocky rollout. The app was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/01/vigilante-app-removed-apple-store"&gt;pulled from Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; over concerns that it encouraged users to directly take on crime themselves. It was relaunched as Citizen in 2017, providing information transcribed from police and fire dispatch audio. Users also have the option to livestream incidents on the app with guidance to “never approach a crime scene, interfere with an incident, or get in the way of police.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="824J5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Unfortunately, in this instance, on-the-ground tips were used in place of the proper verification with public safety agencies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JOD2y"&gt;The app now provides alerts about crime in more than 30 cities. Citizen’s website boasts that it has sent more than 4 billion alerts and has more than 7 million users. Critics have said the app creates false perceptions about the level of danger to its users and allows users to spread racism in chat replies. More recently, the company raised alarm for &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv88q/citizen-los-angeles-car-private-security"&gt;operating an SUV labeled as “private patrol” in downtown Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, although company representatives insist the vehicle is not engaged in security work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV9iLc"&gt;The Saturday broadcast came &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/5/18/22442024/citizen-app-manhunt-california-fires-arson"&gt;through Citizen’s recently launched OnAir feature&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended as a means to broadcast public safety notices. It’s only the 16th time the feature has been activated, although it’s the first time a cash bounty has been put forward so aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnCrjj"&gt;OnAir has “strict validation protocols to limit the spread of misinformation,” a Citizen spokesperson said in a statement. “In the 15 instances it has been used before, those protocols were followed, unfortunately, in this instance, on-the-ground tips were used in place of the proper verification with public safety agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQxBbu"&gt;“We deeply regret our mistake and are working to improve our internal processes to prevent this from happening again,” the spokesperson continued. They did not address why the service chose to offer a bounty for the suspect in the case specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KaYJ97"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is a huge cohort of engaged users who want to help.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85CjHE"&gt;Frame may have had a personal stake in the fire; property records indicate he is the current owner of a Bel Air mansion within 10 miles of the blaze, with little development in between. In the days following the alert, the fire has grown to 1,158 acres and is still expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vpvCC"&gt;A Citizen spokesperson denied any personal motivation and said Frame’s current residence was not threatened by the fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQdN9a"&gt;The Palisades Fire was set by an arsonist in a steep canyon west of Los Angeles just after 10PM on May 14th, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The county ordered evacuations of the surrounding area the following evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8Fxbe"&gt;It is not clear where Citizen first obtained information indicating an arsonist was responsible for the fire. On Saturday, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jay Balgemino told the Pacific Palisades Residents Association that police were searching for an arson suspect. “It appears as though a homeless man living in our hillsides with a criminal past has planned out a wild rampage,” read a post on the association’s Facebook page just after 6PM. “We cannot take the risk of allowing more homeless in a neighborhood with such a fragile environmental landscape.” The association took the post down after an inquiry from &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl6zBS"&gt;However Frame first saw the false identification, the Slack messages show he saw it as an “opportunity” for Citizen to fulfill its “true mission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzYpHh"&gt;“Those people all live there and their homes/families are being threatened,” he wrote in Slack. “There is a huge cohort of engaged users who want to help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdgbIs"&gt;Around 10PM that day, Citizen broadcast a livestream where it displayed a photo of the man and offered the reward for his capture, according to journalist Cerise Castle, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cerisecastle/status/1393804890384728064"&gt;who reported the event on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The hosts did not elaborate on the source of the information but encouraged users to “hunt this guy down.” Twitter users identified one of the hosts as Prince Mapp, Citizen’s head of community and culture, although Citizen declined to confirm the identities of the hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnblBn"&gt;“We know the guy is out there,” said one host, according to Castle. “We need our users to get out there and bring this guy to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D05iTV"&gt;But the man they identified was detained a short time later and released, sheriff’s Lt. Jim Braden told Kate Cagle, a reporter for Spectrum News. Braden said the deputies did not have evidence to charge the man with a crime. He called the actions by Citizen potentially “disastrous” and would only lead to someone getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1w0kTs"&gt;Citizen promoted the livestream on its Twitter account but later deleted the tweet. On Sunday morning, deputies arrested a different man on suspicion of arson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VC61t8"&gt;And while Citizen said it plans to get it right next time, Frame suggested in a Slack message that it won’t be the last time Citizen offers a cash reward. “We need to build this into the product and we will,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter previews Ticketed Spaces, says it’ll take a 20 percent cut of sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQP3BZcUkHLGJeegR5300puR7TY=/0x0:3849x2566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69323358/twittermonetization.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter will launch its Ticketed Spaces in the next couple weeks.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GHLiI9"&gt;Twitter’s getting ready for the launch of its Ticketed Spaces feature, and today, it’s previewing what users can expect when they go to host their first one. US users will be able to apply to host paid live audio rooms starting in the next couple weeks. Anyone who wants to charge has to have 1,000 followers, have hosted three spaces in the past 30 days, and be at least 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izegSw"&gt;The company is partnering with Stripe to handle payments, and it says users will receive 80 percent of revenue after Apple and Google’s in-app purchase fees are taken. So if you sell a $10 ticket, Apple would presumably take a 30 percent cut, leaving you and Twitter to split the remaining $7. Eighty percent would go to you, and 20 percent would go to Twitter. The company says it’ll cover the cost of Stripe’s transaction fees. (Hosts will also need a Stripe account.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKWFmH"&gt;You can see the full product flow below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jifOLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10512000"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn7H9L"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson says initial applications, when they open, will be processed within a few weeks, and the team plans to start with a small test group. Although only US users will be able to host these ticketed spaces for now, anyone around the globe can purchase access. Spaces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;just began&lt;/a&gt; allowing anyone with more than 600 followers to host and added &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1395423942400102401"&gt;the ability to schedule&lt;/a&gt; an event, and the company says it’s working on co-hosted spaces as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhXLmy"&gt;This live audio function is among the multiple ways Twitter has announced that it will help its users monetize. It’s planning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;, too, which will let people pay for bonus content, like a newsletter subscription and more tweets, and it’s launching a communities feature. The company hasn’t said whether the 80 / 20 split will also apply to Super Follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLvuHQ"&gt;Twitter also might offer a bigger subscription product called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;, which could let people pay for additional features, like the ability to undo tweets. Although Twitter’s product has remained mostly stagnant for years, it’s issued a rapid-fire succession of consumer-facing product announcements this past year, seemingly all in an effort to diversify its revenue and build a more fully rounded place where people can consume a variety of content across text, audio, and video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin Enduro review: marathon runner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The fitness watch that lives up to its name&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kllDRC"&gt;Battery life has been the Achilles’ heel of smartwatches and fitness watches. While solid state storage and processing power have been evolving at a rapid clip, battery life has remained stagnant. This goes quintuple for watches that track your activity using GPS, which is a particularly power-hungry thing to do. And yet, somehow, the Garmin Enduro now exists. If you’re the type of person who likes to run until their kneecaps have been ground into a fine powder, this is the watch for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfZn0F"&gt;The $800 Enduro is a multisport fitness watch. And by multi, I mean pretty much all the sports. Built-in activities include: Run, Ultra Run, Trail Run, Treadmill, Virtual Run, Track Run, Indoor Track Run, Bike, Mountain Bike, Indoor Bike, Pool Swim, Open Water Swim, Triathlon, SwimRun, Hike, Expedition, Climb, Indoor Climb, Bouldering, Ski, Snowboard, Cross Country Ski, Cross Country Skate Ski, Backcountry Ski, Surf, SUP, Kayak, Row, Indoor Row, Navigate, Track Me, Pilates, Yoga, Breathwork, Cardio, Strength, Golf, and others (including downloadable options made by third parties) but honestly I’m tired of typing. Basically, it has all of the same activity modes as Garmin’s current multisport flagship, the Fenix 6 (starting at $550, up to $1,100), but there are some significant tradeoffs, which I’ll get to in a sec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pfhMCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10510917"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cnlwFb"&gt;Let’s start with the body. Physically, the Enduro is a perfect twin of the larger Fenix 6X. (You can see a more in-depth comparison between the two &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2FcompareResult.ep%3FcompareProduct%3D702902%26compareProduct%3D702797&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22446410%2Fgarmin-enduro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Garmin’s site&lt;/a&gt;.) It has a 1.4-inch transflective (sunlight visible) color LCD screen. It’s extremely easy to read, particularly outdoors (at night it lights up with the push of a button). The screen also doubles as a low-key solar panel, giving you extra juice when you wear it outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q518KM"&gt;The body is just over two inches by two inches and 0.6 inches thick. In other words, it’s a bit chunky, and people with smaller wrists probably will not like it. I have weirdly big wrist bones, so I didn’t mind the way it felt, and it didn’t look like I was wearing a tablet on my arm. Despite its size it’s quite light, coming in at 71 grams for the steel version or 61 grams for the more expensive titanium version. That weight is partly due to the new, slightly stretchy nylon strap, which is comfortable and dries quickly. There are a lot of other strap options to choose from, should you so desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZKj2s"&gt;Like the Fenix and most other Garmin watches, the Enduro has five physical buttons which you use for navigating in lieu of a touchscreen. This is the most intuitive of any of the fitness watches I’ve used, and the UI has only gotten better with age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xCwrh_eM59NvoYODZzR-guvHz8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529263/20210518GarminEnduro6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Enduro lacks a touchscreen but has five physical buttons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvxfhP"&gt;In addition to being a training watch, it has basic smartwatch features, including displaying notifications from your phone. Android users (like me, I tested it with a Pixel 5) can quick reply to messages from the watch (unfortunately Apple has blocked this feature on the iPhone for any device except the Apple Watch, which seems pretty anti-competitive if you ask me). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlAGKp"&gt;From the main screen, pressing the bottom left button (the down button) gets you to a bunch of widgets that provide a lot of data at a glance. It’s just the right amount of information density. If you want more granular info, you can dive into the Garmin Connect app (iOS and Android), which has a lot of detail, but its design is very dated and it can be tricky to find what you’re looking for in it. It’s not bad, but it could benefit from a refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xCriW"&gt;In addition to daily tracking of things like steps, floors climbed, heart rate, sleep quality, and even respiration rate, the Enduro also has a pulse oximeter which uses a special red LED. In my testing, it was roughly as accurate as the finger-based (medical grade) one I bought toward the beginning of lockdown last year. You can choose to have it track your pulse ox 24/7, but that will take a big bite out of your battery life. You can also choose to just track pulse ox as you sleep, which might be good for someone who suffers from sleep apnea. If you don’t have any underlying health concerns, though, I’d just leave it off and check it on demand whenever you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wb1pLk"&gt;The Enduro is primarily a training watch, and it has all of the excellent tools that the Fenix line has, including Body Battery (which surprisingly mapped quite closely to how well rested or depleted I felt), Stress, VO2 Max over time, as well as Training Status. There are some new features debuting on this watch as well. One of the most useful I found was Trail Run VO2 Max. It takes terrain into account, so if you’re running slower because of rocks, it won’t give you an artificially low V02 Max score. Garmin has also upgraded its ClimbPro features, which take ascend and descend into consideration in both your stats and your pace recommendations. The watch can even alert you before you get to a hill (you have to preload a route into the watch) so you can prepare yourself for a climb. There are also new Ultrarunning specific features which I was unable to test because I prefer other ways of injuring myself. It’s worth noting that these new features are also making their way to the Fenix line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Ea76QtOBZgk201lnMNY7MXqXdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529273/20210518GarminEnduro5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Enduro’s soft velcro strap is comfortable and dries quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tU51eTEIHjE3GQyUPEfbQWJRjSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529278/20210518GarminEnduro3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the underside of Enduro’s titanium chassis are the sensors necessary for tracking your vitals, including a pulse oximeter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8xQ9v0"&gt;So, why might you want the Enduro over the Fenix? Capital B Battery life. That is really the one and only reason. The battery lasts more than twice as long as the Fenix, and the Fenix is one of the longest-lasting training watches I’ve tested. If you currently use an Apple Watch, you may weep when you read this, but here are the numbers the company claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JPzPHB"&gt;Smartwatch mode: up to 50 days / 65 days with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x0p5al"&gt;Battery Saver Watch mode: up to 130 days / one year with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="akLdXC"&gt;GPS: up to 70 hours / 80 hours with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qmyILE"&gt;Max Battery GPS mode: up to 200 hours / 300 hours with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1SX1wd"&gt;Expedition GPS Activity: up to 65 days / 95 days with solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1laEto"&gt;That is absolutely unparalleled. It’s also conservative in my estimation. I wore this watch for a solid month, constantly using it as a smartwatch (checking notifications, checking my vitals, etc). That included 12 hours and 51 minutes of surfing (GPS tracked), four hours and three minutes of running (GPS tracked), and three hours and 16 minutes of strength training (non-GPS). I did not have to take the watch off to charge it at all. Not one single time. It is easily the longest-lasting training / smartwatch I have ever tested, and by a gigantic margin. Garmin claims that it didn’t do this by stuffing in a larger physical battery but by optimizing the underlying platform. I tried to get more details, but they were understandably tight-lipped about the secret recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZICheo"&gt;So, you may see that and think “well then, obviously this is an easy choice over the Fenix 6, right?” Well, not quite. There are some things the Enduro doesn’t have, and they aren’t insignificant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nS6dqYCeN2-USHlpcgyy2ePgJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529275/Screenshot_20210517_090713_Connect.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garmin’s app is functional but in need of a refresh. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vv8Z6e"&gt;The biggest thing the Enduro lacks is maps. The Fenix 6 has topographic maps of the entire US built right into it, and that’s been incredibly useful to me. It’s actually kept me from taking wrong turns while hiking on a number of occasions. You can still track back with the Enduro, bread-crumb style, but it will appear as a disembodied trail without any context or landmarks to help guide you. This also means the Enduro doesn’t have some specific cycling training and other navigational features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHHCqU"&gt;The other big thing the Enduro is missing is music. The Fenix allows you to store songs on it and play them via Bluetooth earbuds, so you can leave your phone at home. The Enduro doesn’t. If you want tunes to go with your workout, you’re going to need to carry a second device. This brings up a somewhat frustrating point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jul91"&gt;With those things missing, you might assume that it’s because the Enduro has less storage compared to the Fenix. It doesn’t. In fact, it has double the storage of the Fenix at 64GB vs. 32GB. As far as I can tell, the only reason the Enduro doesn’t have maps and music is because Garmin didn’t want to cannibalize sales of the Fenix 6, which is frustrating. If you compare the Enduro to the Fenix 6 Pro Solar edition (which has the same hidden solar-panel display as the Enduro), both watches are a wince-inducing $800. The Fenix is a bit more svelte and has a very slightly smaller screen, but otherwise they’re the same. You just have to choose, do you want maps and all the features they come with, or do you want double the battery life? Garmin could have easily given you both — and perhaps the Fenix 7 or Enduro 2 will have both, or a firmware update could bring maps and music to the Enduro — but for now it’s an either / or between two fantastic features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-ncM3NX5tXQcuzXsJNljwZntzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22529280/20210518GarminEnduro8_sq.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Enduro is the watch to get if you never want to worry about charging it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VgxMDZ"&gt;It’s a strange dilemma. Ultimately, I think the Fenix 6 is the better, more complete watch, and so that’s the one I would lean toward recommending. You just have to remember to charge it three times as often. That being said, the Enduro is still an excellent watch, and being able to go on a very long trip and leave the (proprietary) charger at home is a real boon, and if you do any ultra-length activities, then this is absolutely the watch you want. For now, I’ll stick with the Fenix 6 in case I get lost, again. &lt;/p&gt;
