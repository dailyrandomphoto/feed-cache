    <title>How to watch the Xbox 20th anniversary event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1CRDSyaqECl1YlFfhYW7-4KPAzQ=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143735/xbox_anniversary_event_savethedate_3840x2160.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GaBzky"&gt;Microsoft is holding a special Xbox anniversary event today to celebrate 20 years to the day since the original Xbox debuted alongside &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. “While we won’t announce any new games, this broadcast will be a special look back at all the memories we’ve shared with the Xbox community over the past two decades,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynVM2A"&gt;While the event is designed as a celebration rather than a news event, that doesn’t mean there won’t be news. Rumors suggest we may well see an early beta of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer to mark 20 years of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and plenty of Xbox fans have spotted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1458932415439593474"&gt;suspicious updates&lt;/a&gt; to existing original Xbox and Xbox 360 games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvR9zz"&gt;We’re expecting the event to run for around 30 minutes in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CR1IjE"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE XBOX 20th ANNIVERSARY EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the livestream, which starts at 10AM PT / 1PM ET on Monday, November 15th. If you miss the livestream, you’ll be able to catch a replay after the event wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH IT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rJG3mU"&gt;Microsoft is hosting the stream on Xbox’s official &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; channels and its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/xbox/"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;. The YouTube stream is embedded above for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft blocks EdgeDeflector to force Windows 11 users into Edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jIbGHDIr-9FROnY5LPK1YPpybk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143561/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3NJz7"&gt;Microsoft has already made it more difficult to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;switch default browsers in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company is going a step further by blocking apps like EdgeDeflector. Third-party apps like EdgeDeflector and even Firefox have offered workarounds to Microsoft forcing people to use Edge in Start menu search results, even if their default browser is not Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GF5MZ"&gt;Microsoft has been forcing Windows 10 and Windows 11 users into Edge and its Bing search engine in the Start menu search results, and now with the new Widgets panel in Windows 11. It’s a frustrating part of Windows that doesn’t respect your default browser choice. EdgeDeflector lets you bypass these restrictions, and open Start menu search results in your default browser of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5alTy"&gt;The EdgeDeflector block first appeared in an early preview build of Windows 11 last week. While the block initially looked like a bug, Microsoft has now confirmed the changes will arrive for all Windows 11 users in a software update that’s arriving in the coming weeks. Microsoft has decided to prevent app developers from invoking &lt;em&gt;microsoft-edge&lt;/em&gt; protocol links, which are now restricted to the Edge browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KTFns9uTRYxamL4Apxllkq4IOQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015540/windows11defaults.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 makes it harder to set default apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sKIzLw"&gt;“Windows openly enables applications and services on its platform, including various web browsers,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “At the same time, Windows also offers certain end-to-end customer experiences in both Windows 10 and Windows 11, the search experience from the taskbar is one such example of an end-to-end experience that is not designed to be redirected. When we become aware of improper redirection, we issue a fix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir3QOt"&gt;This “fix” is now part of an upcoming &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/12/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-346-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;imminent update to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; that arrived for Beta and Release Preview users late on Friday, and the developer of EdgeDeflector isn’t happy with Microsoft’s changes. “These aren’t the actions of an attentive company that cares about its product anymore,” &lt;a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/microsoft-edge-protocol-competition.html"&gt;says Daniel Aleksandersen&lt;/a&gt;, developer of EdgeDeflector, in a critical blog post last week. “Microsoft isn’t a good steward of the Windows operating system. They’re prioritizing ads, bundleware, and service subscriptions over their users’ productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zzrYkX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"},{"title":"Mozilla has defeated Microsoft’s default browser protections in Windows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671182/mozilla-default-browser-windows-protections-firefox"},{"title":"Mozilla’s Firefox browser arrives in the Windows store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771845/mozilla-firefox-microsoft-store-windows-download"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VBV6ty"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t explained why it has suddenly started to block EdgeDeflector and other apps, but it’s very clear why. “The 500,000 EdgeDeflector users were probably never more than a nuisance to Microsoft,” explains Aleksandersen. “However, last month both the Brave and Firefox web browsers &lt;a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/anti-competitive-browser-edges.html"&gt;either copied EdgeDeflector’s functionality&lt;/a&gt; or signaled it was on the roadmap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tp2fAe"&gt;Firefox has 200 million users, so that’s likely to have caught Microsoft’s attention and lead them to patch this workaround. Mozilla isn’t impressed with Microsoft’s block here, either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwtIGJAi6Ju8Jz35JiMyYASqZXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015541/1PwQMSA.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox in the Microsoft Store doesn’t include default browser workarounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SlNYVp"&gt;“People deserve choice. They should have the ability to simply and easily set defaults and their choice of default browser should be respected,” says a Mozilla spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have worked on code that launches Firefox when the microsoft-edge protocol is used for those users that have already chosen Firefox as their default browser. Following the recent change to Windows 11, this planned implementation will no longer be possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCfoF9"&gt;Mozilla also implemented its own workaround to quickly and easily set Firefox as the default browser on Windows 10 and Windows 11 in a single click. It’s a feature that Microsoft limits to its Edge browser. While Mozilla’s workaround is available in the version of Firefox you download from the web, if you download &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771845/mozilla-firefox-microsoft-store-windows-download"&gt;Firefox from the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; then the default browser workaround is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRziqp"&gt;“Firefox ships an MSIX package in the Windows Store so that our users on Windows 10 and Windows 11 are able to download Firefox from the Store,” explains a Mozilla spokesperson. “MSIX packages run in a ‘Windows package environment.’ The aspects of the Windows environment that Firefox relies on when users choose Firefox to be their default browser do not work in a MSIX environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ673E"&gt;Microsoft’s changes here are gross, particularly the Windows 11 ones that make it more difficult to switch default browsers in the first place. It’s an aggressive strategy that reminds me of the ugly antitrust battle for bundling Internet Explorer in Windows. Microsoft also faced multiple fines in Europe over its anti-competitive Internet Explorer bundling, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/6/4069126/eu-fines-microsoft-for-windows-7-sp1-browser-ballot"&gt;$730 million fine for breaking a 2009 antitrust agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9mGcU"&gt;The strangest part of Microsoft forcing people to use Edge and ignoring browser defaults in Windows is that Microsoft Edge is a good browser. Microsoft shouldn’t need to force you into using it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ Nord 2 Pac-Man Edition pays tribute to the arcade classic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUf0nxAEZkWgxBQUdFeIdLFAwcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143278/jporter_211111_4874_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are eight Pac-Man-themed wallpapers installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYJOef"&gt;OnePlus has announced a special Pac-Man Edition of the Nord 2. It’s a new version of the company’s latest mid-range smartphone with design tweaks inspired by the classic ‘80s arcade game. But underneath the new theme this is fundamentally the same hardware as the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; released in July this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOaPFL"&gt;The Pac-Man enhancements made to the phone are mostly cosmetic. Its back has a small Pac-Man logo on it and glows in the dark to reveal a Pac-Man maze, and there’s also a semi-translucent themed case featuring the titular character alongside ghostly antagonists Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. Boot up the phone and you’re presented with a dynamic Pac-Man-themed wallpaper, one of eight in total. There’s a Pac-Man themed charging animation, and other 8-bit-style touches include redesigned icons for OnePlus’ stock apps and retro notification alert sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJy2OAWbleYMN0gKDAxkeh_rYY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007013/jporter_211111_4874_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_7l1HI8IRhD_ZWw3pKUeHR-apg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007019/jporter_211111_4874_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63qdarShk-0knxf1YblIEQ9ZbjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007018/jporter_211111_4874_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m5oT1yl1Z9ura_uuh5jL02Yrcgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007014/jporter_211111_4874_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s also a Pac-Man-themed case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="si9nzF"&gt;If you order the phone directly from OnePlus, you also get a Pac-Man-themed stand which you build yourself out of Lego-style building blocks. Oh, and there’s also a Pac-Man game that comes pre-installed on the phone: 2015’s free-to-play &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 256. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouWO5k"&gt;Otherwise, in terms of hardware the Pac-Man Edition is the same as the original Nord 2. That means it’s got a 6.43-inch 1080p 90Hz OLED display, is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI processor, and has a 4,500mAh battery which can be fast-charged at 65W. There are three cameras on the back: a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel monochrome camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Snv7A"&gt;OnePlus is of course no stranger to co-branding its devices, having previously worked with brands including McLaren with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18135063/oneplus-6t-mclaren-edition-specs-price-announcement-warp-charge"&gt;OnePlus 6T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/10/20906256/oneplus-7t-pro-release-date-price-news-features-pop-up-selfie-camera-90hz-screen"&gt;7T Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732353/oneplus-harry-potter-limited-edition-smartwatch-watch-faces"&gt;Harry Potter for a recent India-exclusive watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0OXzH"&gt;The Pac-Man edition of the phone is available with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and will cost £499 (€529 / ₹37,999) in the UK, Europe, and India when it goes on sale on November 16th. That’s a small premium over the £469 / €499 / ₹34,999 OnePlus charges for the non-Pac-Man Nord 2 with the same specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeVVQb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylvrdU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung releases Android 12-powered One UI 4 for Galaxy S21 phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lwf6FBj-SQLfnJEJcWEABooTDMU=/0x0:1377x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143277/image5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One UI 4 includes redesigned widgets.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sz6dsU"&gt;Samsung is making its One UI 4 software update available for the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra starting today, the company has announced. The update is based on this year’s Android 12, was released in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22672780/samsung-android-12-beta-galaxy-s21"&gt;public beta in September&lt;/a&gt;, and adds new theming options, keyboard tweaks, and privacy settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Og4k"&gt;The new features coming with the latest version of Samsung’s software should look familiar to anyone who’s been keeping up with Android 12’s upgrades. First up is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Material You-style&lt;/a&gt; overhaul, including the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/all-samsung-stock-apps-with-material-you-design-one-ui-4-0/"&gt;change the operating system’s color scheme&lt;/a&gt; based on your chosen wallpaper, and there are also redesigned widgets. New privacy-focused features include a Privacy Dashboard that keeps track of how often apps are requesting sensitive information from your phone, and there are also new indicators that show when the phone’s camera or microphone are in use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_X1Bk9yT2FmtEtgk4STYdqS5-Ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015468/image2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Privacy Dashboard shows how often apps are requesting sensitive info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="pHicdw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vJwjLz"&gt;Other new features include a tweaked keyboard that offers more animated emoji and stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1Iwfv"&gt;Although the One UI 4 update is currently limited to Samsung’s S21 series, the company says it’ll be available “soon” on a range of its other devices including older Galaxy S, Galaxy Note, and Galaxy A devices, as well as Samsung’s foldables, and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pS7BRK"&gt;Although its press release doesn’t give an official timeframe for the update’s release on these phones, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrontTron/status/1460132525657845761"&gt;notice that appeared&lt;/a&gt; in the Samsung Members app in Korea earlier today gives a better idea of timings. According to this notice, which was deleted shortly after being posted, the Z Flip 3, Z Fold 3, S20 series, Note 20 series, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip 5G could receive their One UI 4 updates in December. Older foldables, as well as Note 10 and S10 devices appear likely to follow in January, while Samsung’s tablets could start receiving the update from February, starting with the Tab S7 and S7 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1X7bsU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uV4xZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop has heart, style, and some rough edges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpf4i9VLCjwdhRW37IBwsZ8IziA=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70143160/COWBOYBEB_Unit_08114RC4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Two perspectives on the live-action series&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="udRy8j"&gt;Netflix’s live-action take on &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; comes with a lot of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPn8a5"&gt;Much of those come from the existing fans, of course — those who loved the original anime with its jazz- and corgi-infused mix of noir and sci-fi and are hoping the new series does it justice. Then there are those coming to the show without existing expectations, who are just looking for some great space capers. On top of this, Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is also the latest in a growing list of attempts at turning classic anime into live-action shows or movies. For the most part, these have been an unqualified disaster, whether it’s the Americanized &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; movie or M. Night Shyamalan’s forgettable take on &lt;em&gt;The Last Airbender.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Z9lz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, though, has offered glimpses of hope in the lead-up to its debut. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691323/cowboy-bebop-netflix-opening-title-sequence-watch"&gt;the painfully stylish opening credits sequence&lt;/a&gt;, a promising cast featuring the likes of Daniella Pineda, John Cho, and John Cho’s hair, and the all-important news that Yoko Kanno would return to compose the main theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnZ2D6"&gt;To figure out whether or not the series will satisfy any of these audiences, we enlisted long-time &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; fan Ash Parrish and newcomer Andrew Webster to binge all 10 episodes and report back. Let’s go, space cowboys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="jI7aw2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULCIHP5dc44?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft9kL2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I have to admit, the show didn’t grab me at first, which was surprising. It has a lot of things I love: great music; a retrofuturistic world; elements of noir, westerns, and even a hint of samurai movies; and characters defined by mystery. The Netflix series is centered on a trio of bounty hunters — called cowboys, in this universe — who form an uneasy alliance. There’s Spike (Cho), the prototypical badass with a dark and mysterious past. Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir), his self-serious partner who used to be a cop and is trying his best to be a good dad. Soon enough, they’re joined by Faye Valentine (Pineda), an amnesiac looking to find out who she really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EaMZc"&gt;It’s a great setup, but something about it felt… off, at least early on. Some of it was the aesthetics — Jet’s strange beard that’s obviously a wig or Spike’s odd-fitting suit. The action felt stiff, and the CG looked cheap. Meanwhile, everyone behaved like a flat caricature in the early episodes. It seemed like the show expected me to already know and understand these characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYt93m"&gt;But things changed the more time I spent with them. The highlight of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; for me has been the found-family dynamic between Jet, Faye, and Spike. The way Jet can’t help but be a dad, taking everyone out for bowling and forcing them to have fun, or how Spike &lt;em&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to do the right thing but keeps getting caught up in his old life. I went from not caring about these characters to tearing up when Faye finally gets the smallest hint about her past. It took some time and looking past some of the show’s rough edges, but I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOhje7"&gt;Ash, what was it like coming to this from the anime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49YLRu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash: &lt;/strong&gt;I felt what you felt initially. &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; was such a formative experience for me as a teenager covertly watching the anime long after my appointed bedtime. I can definitively state that I wouldn’t become the person I am now without this show. Its aesthetic, from the noir-style storytelling to its jazzy soundtrack, became the foundation from which most of my taste, style, and ambitions come. But instead of recoiling with horror when the show was announced, which is understandable whenever an anime gets life action-ified, I was cautiously optimistic. If the show failed, at least I’d get new Yoko Kanno music. If the show succeeded, I’d finally have an anime adaptation worth a damn, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I’d get new Yoko Kanno music. I couldn’t lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUpevs"&gt;But my cautious optimism deflated after the first two episodes. I already didn’t like that the opening credits was a shot-for-shot reproduction of the anime’s credits, and the first episodes looked amateurish — like Netflix was putting on a &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; community theater performance rather than an ostensibly million-dollar production. It wasn’t any of the actors’ fault; I just felt they were doing their best with less than stellar dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OGy5c"&gt;John Cho (and his hair) can do no wrong, and he perfectly embodies the kind of nonchalant, wiseass I know Spike Spiegel to be. You’d be forgiven if you heard Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black and thought you were listening to Beau Billingslea from the anime dub. Pineda’s Faye was the breakout character, though. She’s not the Faye Valentine I knew but a better one, updated for modern audience sensibilities. She’s funnier than her anime counterpart, and her sexiness is transformed to make her feel more competent and less like an object to ogle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLu3h5"&gt;Faye’s transformation is the first evidence of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; being a faithful representation of the spirit of the show and not a simple recreation to the letter. A lot of characters got refreshing updates that translate better to a 2021 live-action show than a straight copy / paste from a 1996 anime would. In particular, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; the anime wasn’t particularly nice to queer characters, framing them as jokes to ridicule or tricksters to be repulsed by. Gren, from the two Jupiter Jazz episodes, was a man who became intersex after he was experimented on in prison. There’s a particularly nasty exchange when Faye catches him naked in the shower and asks, “What are you?” in a disgusted and alarmed tone. Live-action Gren, played by non-binary actor &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4317622/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t15"&gt;Mason Alexander Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;retains their&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;same&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;gender queerness but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;suffers none of the same queerphobia and is instead an integral member of the cast (while also being the best dressed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msaUBL"&gt;When the story failed for me early on, the characters kept me hooked. So we’ve talked about the cast a lot, but what did you think of the world of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2yjXZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t understand how they made this universe work. There’s so much going on, all pulled from so many very obvious inspirations, and yet it feels cohesive. We’ve seen shows like &lt;em&gt;Firefly&lt;/em&gt; struggle to pull this off, for instance; the Western and sci-fi elements of that show worked together, while the attempt to add aspects of Chinese culture seemed forced. But here, everything feels seamless. When the main villain, Vicious (played by a wonderfully menacing and maniacal Alex Hassell) wields a katana, it doesn’t feel out of place, even if he’s a blonde with an English accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5WdKt"&gt;I think the reason for this is the sheer attention to detail in the worldbuilding. The universe feels like a real, lived-in place with history. You can see it in the grim, dirty streets of New Tijuana or the old Macintosh computers and pager-like cellphones everyone has. (Between &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;it’s been a good year for retro hardware&lt;/a&gt;.) The Bebop itself looks like a beat-up space truck on the outside and a dorm room on the inside. You can see various cultures on display everywhere: Jet relaxes with a bonsai garden, listens to Coltrane, keeps a stash of Jamaican rum, and is always on the lookout for new dumpling recipes. I also loved some of the more offbeat worldbuilding elements, like the goofy infomercial-style show that cowboys watch to stay up to date on new bounties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6ki54"&gt;The only thing that lets it down is the uneven CG work. The sets, props, and costumes in &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop &lt;/em&gt;are almost uniformly good (I even warmed to Spike’s suit), but the various effects mostly looked cheap and out of place. This is especially true for just about every scene that takes place in outer space. It goes from a gritty noir western to a made-for-TV sci-fi movie very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKfqkR"&gt;Still, though, there’s something undeniably stylish about it, even when the show’s reach sometimes extends beyond its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKOoLQ"&gt;Now about that music...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMVQ8W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ash:&lt;/strong&gt; Did someone mention &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; music?! When this project was first announced, I remember stating loudly in all caps that this endeavor would unequivocally fail without Yoko Kanno’s music. If she declined to participate or the show’s producers neglected to consider her involvement, then the project should cease, full-stop, because &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; without its music. The soundtrack, produced by Kanno and performed by her jazz band The Seatbelts, is &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s sixth man. The music is integral to &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s defining moments; Spike walking up to the church in “The Ballad of Fallen Angels” just does not have the same impact without the blaring organ of “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/6GB3_O9-iEw"&gt;Rain&lt;/a&gt;” accompanying him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTSbNL"&gt;I was happy, jazzed if you will, to hear my favorite songs in the world remixed and repurposed for a new show. I broke into the biggest grin when Spike appeared for the first time and “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/MduJjbcLSqE"&gt;Spokey Dokey&lt;/a&gt;” was playing on his headphones. One of my biggest concerns early on was that the new &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; would be a shot-for-shot recreation of the anime. I’m so glad it’s not that at all, but there’s a moment that I won’t spoil when the show is a shot-for-shot recreation down to the music, and it works so perfectly that I stood up and hollered. In that moment, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; understood its assignment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTHdxM"&gt;I wish the show dug out some of its less well-known tracks like “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FAgYC89I73Y"&gt;Want It All Back&lt;/a&gt;” — which would have made a great chase sequence song — instead of relying on old standards. I’m also mightily annoyed that I didn’t hear “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YA4P1A3jtu0"&gt;What Planet Is This&lt;/a&gt;” once during the whole show. Missed opportunity. There’s one new song that shows up in the penultimate episode that oozes Kanno. I heard its moody, synthy vibes and instantly recognized Kanno at her best. It will be a crime of the highest order if Netflix doesn’t release the soundtrack. Better yet, a Netflix-sponsored The Seatbelts North American tour. A girl can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAZ7Yb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: The best thing I can say about the show is this: despite the occasionally stilted action, goofy wigs, and uneven CG, it has finally convinced me to binge the anime. It only took 23 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="w7ArVO"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cowboy Bebop &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;starts streaming on Netflix on November 19th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about how Amazon tries to evade responsibility in delivery vehicle crashes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ReGLnf4GWtuNxNoByKgoMzSsID4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70142050/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLQpW9"&gt;Amazon’s fleet of delivery drivers may be detached from Amazon warehouses, but the company still monitors its drivers; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;installed always-on cameras in its delivery trucks&lt;/a&gt; and even asked drivers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347945/amazon-delivery-drivers-ai-surveillance-cameras-vans-consent-form"&gt;consent to yawn-detecting AI surveillance&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s that very surveillance system that puts Amazon in the crosshairs of a lawsuit that claims Amazon is at fault for a life-altering car accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6MC0a"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-12/amazon-com-algorithms-blamed-in-crash-that-paralyzed-aspiring-doctor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report describes the details of the accident, as well as how one lawsuit may change the way legal teams approach similar situations in the future. The accident happened earlier this year, when 24-year-old Ans Rana was riding in the backseat of a Tesla Model S on a bustling Atlanta highway. After the car came to a stop behind a disabled vehicle, an Amazon delivery vehicle slammed into the back of the Tesla, leaving Rana with major brain and spinal-cord injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sityiZ"&gt;Rana filed a lawsuit against Amazon in June, claiming that Amazon is responsible for the accident. But as the report notes, Amazon says it can’t be held accountable due to the fact that the delivery driver technically wasn’t an employee of Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDg0sd"&gt;The delivery driver actually worked for Harper Logistics, LLC, one of the many Delivery Service Partners that Amazon uses for shipping. The Delivery Service Partners program was rolled out in 2018, and according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon’s partners employ over 260,000 drivers globally, some of who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423560/amazon-delivery-drivers-unsafe-reckless-driving-monitoring-app"&gt;claim that their employers tell them to turn off their safety apps&lt;/a&gt; to meet quotas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xstcKI"&gt;That’s why Rana’s lawsuit cruxes on Amazon’s algorithms, apps, and devices that Amazon uses to micromanage its workers. The lawyer on Rana’s case, Scott Harrison, aims to prove that Amazon still exerts control over its Delivery Service Partners using technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="94zLuN"&gt;Amazon closely tracks delivery drivers’ every move, the lawsuit states, including ‘backup monitoring, speed, braking, acceleration, cornering, seatbelt usage, phone calls, texting, in-van cameras that use artificial intelligence to detect for yawning, and more.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OcG3ST"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, most commercial vehicle lawsuits like this are typically resolved without much attention. However, Rana’s case is noteworthy due to his legal team’s claims that Amazon’s monitoring systems make the company liable. Rana’s attorney wants to look into exactly how Amazon’s machines control its operations, but doing so would reveal Amazon’s algorithms, which Amazon reportedly argues could be classified as “trade secrets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="idnUkT"&gt;The company designs and assigns routes and determines how many deliveries each driver should be able to accomplish in a 10-hour shift. It monitors each driver’s performance via smartphone app, cameras and other hardware installed in Amazon-branded delivery vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OIzgGk"&gt;The company can tell the delivery partners to take drivers it deems too slow off the road, essentially firing them. Rana’s lawsuit argues that such practices made Amazon negligent in the crash because they ‘forced drivers to rush to the point it was unsafe’ and ‘focused on speed and delivery efficiency without giving due consideration to the safety of the public.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P0i68b"&gt;If Rana’s legal strategy works, this could influence the outcome of a number of lawsuits to come. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; mentions that Amazon Logistics has been the defendant in 119 vehicle injury lawsuits this year alone, which reportedly quadruples the number of incidents that occurred last year. And with the holiday season coming up, that number may be on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F09TBI"&gt;In February, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; states that a Texas couple reportedly sued Amazon for $1 million in damages following an alleged crash with a delivery driver — but the case has since been dismissed. Another man in Massachusetts reportedly suffered from brain injuries after a head-on collision with an Amazon delivery driver who allegedly fell asleep at the wheel. Amazon supposedly has yet to respond to that case, which &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says was filed in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baV1xz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-12/amazon-com-algorithms-blamed-in-crash-that-paralyzed-aspiring-doctor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report&lt;/a&gt; is an eye-opening story that’s both heartbreaking and angering, but still provides a small shred of hope that something might change. Most importantly, it sheds light on Amazon’s treatment of delivery drivers, as well as how that may have an impact on everyone else on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Business Essentials subscriptions support small businesses that only use Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Business Essentials" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/214E4eCO0GHP-fXd2cfEyioGrgM=/0x33:1500x1033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141412/Apple_Apple_Business_Essentials_11102021_1500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Business Essentials | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="epZ2WM"&gt;This week Apple unveiled another beta program, but instead of offering early previews of software for your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, it’s a new initiative &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/business/essentials/"&gt;called Business Essentials&lt;/a&gt;. In line with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;recent shift toward selling services&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a subscription package aimed at small businesses with three different plans and a move that has been anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.fleetsmith.com/fleetsmith-acquired-by-apple"&gt;since it acquired the device management platform Fleetsmith&lt;/a&gt; a little over a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOgfna"&gt;Starting at $2.99 per device per month, they can cover employees across a single device, more than one device, or a more expensive plan that covers multiple devices and adds more cloud storage. An AppleCare+ package will be available when it launches full in spring 2022, adding 24/7 phone support, access to training, and on-site repairs from Apple-trained technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cpUisD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OushE7mq0Ak?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mgUa2W"&gt;Like many other device manage platforms, it streamlines the onboarding process, preinstalled apps, as well as management of security settings like FileVault for disk encryption and Activation Lock to secure devices if they’re lost or stolen. There’s also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212754"&gt;a new Business Essentials app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that puts all of the various settings in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSjMeu"&gt;I spoke to Vox Media senior VP of IT, Oumar Sall, who points out that it could be beneficial for startups during periods of high growth. Particularly while dealing with more remote workers, it can help get new employees up and running as quickly as possible even if a business doesn’t have the other parts of its network fully formed yet. It could also be helpful for schools if Apple’s existing &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/education/k12/it/"&gt;School Manager&lt;/a&gt; system isn’t a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bYN5BX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vox Media’s Eric Arredondo on working as IT support","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22444109/it-support-slack-macbook-keychron-zendesk"},{"title":"How Apple’s enterprise app program became the new Wild West of mobile apps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18232583/apple-ios-developer-enterprise-program-store-mobile-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H9JRyT"&gt;It also has the advantage of being available from Apple itself. However, it’s unlikely to challenge mainstays in the industry since, at least so far, it is limited by the number of employees supported, and it isn’t available across different platforms. There’s also the question of how exporting data works if a company wants to leave iCloud, endpoint security management, and the other issues that can crop up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nsP40"&gt;Jamf is one of those companies, as it provides device management to a number of organizations, including Vox Media. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4468740-jamf-holding-corp-jamf-ceo-dean-hager-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;On an earnings call Friday&lt;/a&gt; after Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-introduces-apple-business-essentials/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Dean Hager said that he expects the service will help improve Apple’s built-in management tools that Jamf also relies on, without competing directly with many features Jamf provides. If Business Essentials helps kickstart adoption among small businesses or startups, it gives them a basis to buy even more Apple devices and services as they grow, even if they eventually move to more on-premises support or another provider altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly relying on states to pay for digital ID rollouts</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MSYOHsRuYaylI_sE51MNxp6dFS0=/129x0:2871x1828/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70141339/license.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ftM9p0"&gt;Apple will soon let users in participating states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;digitally store their driver’s licenses&lt;/a&gt; or state IDs on their iPhone’s wallet, but according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/apple-sticking-taxpayers-with-part-of-the-bill-for-digital-id-rollout.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the initiative will be partially funded by the states — and their taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPDAbi"&gt;CNBC got ahold of contracts signed by Georgia, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, and found that Apple will maintain tight control over its deployment. It reports that Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program, including its device compatibility, the service’s launch date, states’ marketing campaigns, as well as how states report on the initiative's performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qXNBn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple gets “sole discretion” over a number of aspects of the program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R1qbG0"&gt;The contract also says that each state will have to “allocate reasonably sufficient personnel and resources (e.g., staff, project management and funding) to support the launch of the Program on a timeline to be determined by Apple.” This includes testing out the service on different types of Apple devices “in accordance with Apple’s certification requirements.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9AUXV"&gt;Additionally, states are responsible for promoting the digital ID service to citizens, as well as encouraging its adoption among members of the federal and state government, including local police and the Internal Revenue Service. State agencies are required to “feature the Program in all public-facing communications relating to Digital Identity Credentials,” which is subject to Apple’s review and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNp0wG"&gt;And if that isn’t enough, Apple is holding states accountable for the authenticity of the program’s identity verification. The contract absolves Apple from any discrepancies in its verification system, stating: “Apple shall not be liable for any Verification Results, and Agency acknowledges that all Verification Results are provided ‘AS IS’ and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i54w6P"&gt;Despite being an Apple-led program, taxpayers are footing the bill to roll out this single-platform digital ID program in their states — even if they don’t have an iPhone. The contract clearly says “except as otherwise agreed upon between the Parties, neither Party shall owe the other Party any fees under this Agreement,” meaning that the participating states will be funding its promotion and adoption using taxpayer’s tender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQQcCq"&gt;Having a digital ID program — especially one paid for by states — raises a number of concerns, the most obvious one being security. Users are expected to transfer their most sensitive documents to their iPhones, essentially establishing their identities on a single device. If implemented incorrectly, it sets a precedent for surveillance; what happens to user information when a digital ID is scanned at an airport or at an age-restricted concert? This type of tracking information is tempting to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDQ6WF"&gt;Much like what Apple is trying to do with its digital ID program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516653/clear-identity-health-covid-airports"&gt;Clear, a digital identification app&lt;/a&gt;, serves as a fast pass to the front of security lines in airports and sports stadiums, or as an app to store proof of your COVID-19 vaccination. As an article by &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes, Clear considered selling user data in the past, but instead uses that data to promote relevant ads to users. No matter how Apple chooses to leverage this data, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652051/apple-iphone-drivers-license-state-id-arizona-georgia-ios-15"&gt;digital ID system is making its way to Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, Maryland, and Utah, in addition to the four aforementioned states, very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG3sqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI’s email system was hacked to send out fake cybersecurity warnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AiPzwC66vkTZM6s1_aP5XHrUjMM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70140776/acastro_180109_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IiLLc3"&gt;Hackers targeted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) email servers, sending out thousands of phony messages that say its recipients have become the victims of a “sophisticated chain attack,” first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-system-hacked-to-email-urgent-warning-about-fake-cyberattacks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The emails were initially uncovered by &lt;a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/"&gt;The Spamhaus Project&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization that investigates email spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2NEWV"&gt;The emails claim that Vinny Troia was behind the fake attacks and also falsely state that Troia is associated with the infamous hacking group, The Dark Overlord — the same bad actors who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/29/15483850/netflix-hacker-orange-is-the-new-black-ransom"&gt;leaked the fifth season of &lt;em&gt;Orange Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, Troia is a prominent cybersecurity researcher who runs two dark web security companies, NightLion and Shadowbyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dcDNjt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These emails look like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sending IP: 153.31.119.142 (&lt;a href="https://t.co/En06mMbR88"&gt;https://t.co/En06mMbR88&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;From: eims@ic.fbi.gov&lt;br&gt;Subject: Urgent: Threat actor in systems &lt;a href="https://t.co/NuojpnWNLh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NuojpnWNLh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spamhaus (@spamhaus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459452609979371520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ppOmqb"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;, the hackers managed to send out emails to over 100,000 addresses, all of which were scraped from the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) database. A report by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/fbi-s-email-system-compromised-hackers-warn-of-cyber-threat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says that hackers used the FBI’s public-facing email system, making the emails seem all the more legitimate. Cybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont also attests to the email’s legitimate appearance, stating that the headers are authenticated as coming from FBI servers using the Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573813/google-authenticated-brand-logos-gmail-rolling-out-bimi-dmarc"&gt;that’s part of the system Gmail uses to stick brand logos on verified corporate emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BXSDJi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The email was sent from these FBI internal servers, per the headers (which validate with DKIM). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dap00025.str0.eims.cjis - 10.67.35.50&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; wvadc-dmz-pmo003-fbi.enet.cjis &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;dap00040.str0.eims.cjis - 10.66.2.72&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before anybody runs off the Russia cliff, I would check webapps.&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1459521411492589569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D1CLuK"&gt;The FBI responded to the incident in a &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-incident-involving-fake-emails"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s an “ongoing situation” and that “the impacted hardware was taken offline.” Aside from that, the FBI says it doesn’t have any more information it can share at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hERDn0"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;, the spam campaign was likely carried out as an attempt to defame Troia. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vinnytroia/status/1459515619838251010"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Troia speculates that an individual who goes by the name “Pompompurin” may have launched the attack. As &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; notes, that same person has allegedly tried damaging Troia’s reputation in similar ways in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpuFMK"&gt;A report by computer security reporter &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/hoax-email-blast-abused-poor-coding-in-fbi-website/"&gt;Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt; also connects Pompompurin to the incident — the individual allegedly messaged him from an FBI email address when the attacks were launched, stating, “Hi its pompompurin. Check headers of this email it’s actually coming from FBI server.” &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt; even got a chance to speak with Pompompurin, who claims that the hack was meant to highlight the security vulnerabilities within the FBI’s email systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffkjTy"&gt;“I could’ve 1000 percent used this to send more legit looking emails, trick companies into handing over data etc.,” Pompompurin said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;. The individual also told the outlet that they exploited a security gap on the FBI’s Law Enforcement Enterprise (LEEP) portal and managed to sign up for an account using a one-time password embedded in the page’s HTML. From there, Pompompurin claims they were able to manipulate the sender’s address and email body, executing the massive spam campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pHCpC"&gt;With that kind of access, the attack could’ve been much worse than a false alert that put system administrators on high alert. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761208/biden-administration-security-vulnerabilities-patch"&gt;mandated a bug fix that calls for civilian federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; to patch any known threats. In May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; that aims to improve the nation’s cyber defenses in the wake of detrimental attacks on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter shouldn’t be hiding basic app improvements behind its Blue paywall  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OY_aNasx_Uc2HKrj7dvYEYAqaa0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70140559/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwdK9A"&gt;Twitter launched its new subscription product, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt;, in the US this week — it’s a $2.99 per month service that &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-smarter--twitter-harder-with-twitter-blue"&gt;promises to make Twitter&lt;/a&gt; “more customizable, more frictionless, and simply put — better.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3s1y3"&gt;Let’s start just by looking at what’s actually included in a Twitter Blue subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2KqvJU"&gt;Ad-Free Articles (a take on Scroll, for articles you click through on Twitter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0D8PJC"&gt;Top Articles (a take on Nuzzel, for articles discussed on Twitter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P7QNrU"&gt;Themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A4438B"&gt;Bookmark folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cN2ZTs"&gt;Customizable navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E4SHaK"&gt;An “undo button” for Tweets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cloiiO"&gt;A “Reader” mode for reading threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RO3Oze"&gt;Twitter Blue Labs for early access features, including longer videos and pinned DMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="wsXQlU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter will now let you pay to undo tweets and read ad-free news in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="b3U36j"&gt;Looking at that list, there are two different categories of things here: features that enhance or support journalism and news in some fashion (which are, broadly speaking, good) and features that make the Twitter app better or otherwise easier to use, which I have more of an issue with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="881y4V"&gt;It doesn’t take much time using Twitter to realize that the ability to quickly fix a typo would be a nice thing to have. Or that the company should do something to fix threaded conversations, which have become such a mess that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152579/twitter-thread-easier-full-text-reading-unroll-how-to"&gt;there’s actually enough demand for a third-party service&lt;/a&gt;, Thread Reader, specifically to try and wrangle the chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTeB0i"&gt;But instead of just fixing the obvious problems with its product, Twitter Blue takes features like the undo button for tweets, the reader mode for threads, or the ability to edit the navigation bar — basic improvements that would improve Twitter’s usability for everyone — and limits them only to those willing to pay for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtMBGV"&gt;Like Twitter’s blog post says, the goal of Blue is to make Twitter “more frictionless” and “better.” But by limiting these changes to customers who are willing to shell out the $2.99 per month, Twitter is choosing to leave its product actively worse for the bulk of its users in an effort to try and squeeze extra cash out of the far smaller percentage of customers willing to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gwqg1C"&gt;Twitter has effectively spent years leaving much of its platform to stagnate, with inexplicable changes like changing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/3/9661180/twitter-vine-favorite-fav-likes-hearts"&gt;the like button to a heart&lt;/a&gt;, pivots to Instagram-chasing “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461070/twitter-fleets-stories-ads-monetize-instagram-snap"&gt;Fleets&lt;/a&gt;,” and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587583/twitter-new-tweetdeck-preview-beta-hands-on-editorial"&gt;controversial Tweetdeck beta&lt;/a&gt;. And now that the company &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have things that customers have been begging for for years (even if the undo button still isn’t the edit button that everyone’s been clamoring for), it’s charging users for the privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GvPfSf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fixing Twitter’s terrible-to-follow threads should be free, not $36 a year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ng4m56"&gt;Put another way, fixing Twitter’s terrible-to-follow threads should be the default, not something that requires spending $36 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOQyBT"&gt;The Scroll and Nuzzel-style features (Ad-Free Articles and Top Articles) make more sense to me. The idea here of subsidizing and supporting ad-free journalism with subscription payments is a good one, just like it was when Scroll first launched a few years back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGOzuL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111865/scroll-ad-free-website-subscription-launches"&gt;Scroll’s reliance on cookies&lt;/a&gt; (and the tech industry’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;general move away from them&lt;/a&gt;) meant that it was probably inevitable that it would have had to shift to a different model sooner or later. And given the prevalence of Twitter as a news source for millions of people, it’s probably not the worst fit for a successor to the service. Building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/18/5523128/nuzzel-keeps-track-of-twitter-and-facebook-so-you-dont-have-to"&gt;Nuzzel’s Top Articles&lt;/a&gt; into Twitter — where a lot of those conversations happen anyway — makes a lot of sense, too. I’m not wholly on board with the fact that these services are now walled into Twitter’s app exclusively, but that’s the cost of doing business in a world of service acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vipj4H"&gt;But the bulk of Twitter Blue’s features just feel weird to me. Watching Twitter ask users to pony up for extra quality of life changes, as though the company couldn’t take the time or expense to support an undo button without the extra fees, comes off as disingenuous to me in the same sort of way that Disney starting a Patreon to fund a Marvel show or Apple launching a Kickstarter would be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOQOxU"&gt;It’s still very much early days for Twitter Blue, so there’s a lot of time for Twitter to improve the service, roll out more functionality, and expand what’s included in its subscription. But for now, Twitter Blue feels weirdly caught between its news ambitions and a frustrating cash grab. &lt;/p&gt;
