    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Libertarians built a Bitcoin economy in a small New Hampshire town — then feds tore it down&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="BtajKc"&gt;The sky was still dark when the agents arrived at Leverett St. in Keene, New Hampshire, a leafy block of kit houses at the quiet edges of the small college town. They settled on a house at the corner, surrounding it with two armored BearCat G3s and a fleet of unmarked SUVs. Both BearCats had gunners stationed in a hatch on the roof, clad in camo fatigues. The only light came from the blue-and-red sirens, strobing off houses in every direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYzVNT"&gt;Inside, Ian Freeman was asleep with his girlfriend and their small dog Coconut. He woke to the sound of exploding glass. A ramming pole, tethered to the front of one of the BearCats, had plowed through a first floor window, tearing off the frame as it backed up. Freeman threw on a bathrobe and stumbled downstairs, still shaking off sleep. There was shattered glass everywhere. His first thought was that some stranger had thrown a brick. But then he heard a whirring sound, a small hovering drone that police had deployed to explore the house. He looked outside and saw blinding lights. Coming into focus beside the lights, men pointed rifles at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMxTOz"&gt;One mile east, Freeman’s talk radio co-host Aria DiMezzo stumbled downstairs in her underwear only to be met by a tactical assault team, who told her they would shoot her if she moved. At the town’s Bitcoin Embassy, a group of agents tore a Bitcoin dispenser from the concrete floor, leaving four symmetrical holes where it had been bolted down. They took another machine from the Campus Convenience in central Keene, another from a bar called Murphy’s Taproom, and a fourth from the Red Arrow Diner in Nashua. Together, they held more than $50,000 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8PwAG"&gt;There was even more money in Freeman’s home, seized by federal agents and later reported to the courts in a forfeiture filing: $180,000 in cash, a 100oz Swiss silver bar (worth roughly $3,000), and a platinum coin stamped with a portrait of Ron Paul. There were boxes full of gold-laced bills called goldbacks that were too obscure to even put a value on — some taken from Freeman’s home, others seized in transit by the postal service. The biggest prize was two Casascius physical Bitcoins, worth 10 and 1 btc respectively, first available in 2011 and now worth nearly $400,000.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZP1nD_julm23Gv4_9PMF466-4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750683/Mighty_Moose_Mart___Bitcoin_Embassy_Raids.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evidence being removed from the Bitcoin Embassy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wS0BPU"&gt;For police, the money was nearly as important as Freeman himself. For years, they had been tracking his Bitcoin business for evidence of money laundering or other crimes. As far as they were concerned, it was all part of an unlicensed money transmittal scheme processing millions of dollars a year. The purpose of the raid was to break that system, tearing out Freeman’s Bitcoin machines one by one and seizing any illegal proceeds along with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8iE74"&gt;News of the raid spread fast. A local Linux developer and crypto activist named Christopher Waid rushed to Freeman’s house to film the last gasps of the raid, catching footage of the BearCats, the drone, and the bizarre militarism of it all. When he was done there, he headed to the Bitcoin Embassy, where a crowd had gathered to watch police carry out duffel bags and plastic tubs full of loose paper. Despite the name, the embassy was little more than a side room to a convenience store. The most radical part of it was the bookshelf, offering DevOps manuals alongside copies of Ludwig von Mises’ &lt;em&gt;Socialism&lt;/em&gt; and Robert A. Heinlein’s &lt;em&gt;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2jzAM"&gt;For years, Freeman had been warning about federal encroachment, broadcasting every night on the radio about the tightening fist of the state. His Bitcoin venture was part of a broader Free State movement in New Hampshire, turning a quiet corner of New England into a libertarian paradise. Now the counterforce was here, like a prophecy fulfilled, and the Free Staters understood their role perfectly. They were ready with cameras, asking for warrants and litigating precisely where they were allowed to stand while the raid dragged on. When police herded the crowd across the street, it just meant they had to yell that much louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtK2m5"&gt;“You guys are the fucking enemy!” one of the protestors told the agents, as they carried out another tub of papers. “You’re not protecting anybody’s fucking freedom. You’re all a bunch of gangsters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gFwn2B"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oxpc6c"&gt;By the end of the day on March 16th, six people were in custody: including Freeman, his girlfriend, and a married couple who lived nearby. Two co-hosts on the radio show were also named: DiMezzo and a man born as Richard Paul, who had legally changed his name to Nobody in protest of the bureaucratic state. According to the indictment, all six had been involved in Freeman’s Bitcoin dispenser business. An indictment filed under seal the day before the raid counted out thirteen instances when someone from the group had contacted a bank on behalf of the business since April 2017, listing each call or email as a count of wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5aL3et"&gt;The defense lawyers describe the project in more idealistic terms. “The defendants were a loosely affiliated group of people with libertarian political leanings that included a strong belief that Bitcoin was a great development for those who champion human freedom,” one filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L2RMpoBl_8YSGlT6AKX3cZCn9Y8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729604/akrales_210614_4628_0094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Freeman in his home recording studio where he produces FreeTalk Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CwHjFq"&gt;There are lots of people like that in Keene, although you might not guess it from driving through. A quiet college town of less than 25,000 people, the libertarian migration to New Hampshire (also known as the Free State Project) has turned it into a magnet for cryptocurrency buffs, some of whom have unexpectedly become millionaires after the Bitcoin boom of the past few years. In 2019, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; called the town a “crypto mecca,” citing more than 20 businesses accepting some form of cryptocurrency payment. Many of those businesses were solicited directly by Freeman and his cohort, who saw cryptocurrency as a kind of moral crusade against the belligerence of the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UH2JY3"&gt;Freeman is best known as the host of &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt;, a libertarian talk radio show syndicated to 185 radio stations across the country. Many of the activists outside the embassy had appeared on the show at some point, including Waid. When the BearCat rammed through the window, it was ramming into Freeman’s studio, a maze of cables and audio racks where the show is recorded, mixed, and distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GC6p3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt; gave Freeman the power to draw together a community of crypto-minded libertarians in Keene, but it also amplified his ugliest mistakes. Most recently, it gave center stage to his still-active lawsuit against New Hampshire’s mask mandate. (“I was never really convinced that COVID was a particularly dangerous thing,” Freeman tells me when I ask about the case.) The show also gave an early home to the infamous “crying nazi” Christopher Cantwell, who appeared on &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt; when he was still trying to brand himself as a libertarian anti-police activist. (“When he became a racist, I fired him from &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt;,” Freeman says. “He just kept getting deeper into that world.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wEK9n"&gt;The chaotic world of libertarian talk radio made Freeman’s show a natural gathering point for the early Bitcoin community. &lt;em&gt;Free Talk&lt;/em&gt;’s first call about Bitcoin came in December 2010, the same month Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared from active development of the Bitcoin spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="caBY4L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Freeman’s cryptocurrency holdings are now worth well over $1.5 million, according to forfeiture documents&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k3Wjtg"&gt;Hyped on the &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live &lt;/em&gt;site as the first consumer media mention of Bitcoin, the episode now comes off as a bizarre time capsule. The first 20 minutes are taken up with a discussion of voluntarist alternatives to the fire department and municipal road maintenance, after which the conversation turns to crystal meth and Venezuela. Around 40 minutes in, a caller named Jeremy from Australia chimes in to talk about a new digital currency called Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbd8es"&gt;“It was about six cents for a Bitcoin in August and now it’s 26 cents, so it’s already increased quite a bit,” Jeremy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjohq1"&gt;“My initial concern was that it’s essentially a fiat currency, because it’s not backed by anything,” Freeman responds. “It’s a neat idea. I don’t know if it’s yet a fantastic alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ex8ry"&gt;Freeman came around to Bitcoin in the months that followed, eventually fitting it into broader complaints about the way the US government controls the value of the dollar. The price kept rising: within three years it had cleared $1,000, then $10,000 four years after that. According to the forfeiture documents, Freeman’s cryptocurrency holdings are now worth well over $1.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="np4ZOz"&gt;As more money flooded into cryptocurrency, something else came with it. The version of Bitcoin that’s become popular in recent years is less political and more straightforwardly interested in making money. Venture capital has embraced the blockchain as an opportunity on the same scale as targeted advertising or independent-contractor labor schemes. It’s rare to hear concerns about the Federal Reserve at a Bitcoin conference these days, and few are interested in standoffs with regulators — there’s just no money in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4na7I"&gt;But if you’re ready to work with regulators, the money is almost endless. Coinbase, an early adherent to federal Know Your Customer rules, is now processing more than $100 billion of transactions every month, while the company itself is valued at $50 billion. New wallet regulations are creeping forward from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and while some activists cry foul, most entrepreneurs have welcomed them with open arms. At the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, the Winklevoss twins promised a crowd of real estate moguls and retail investors that anyone who owns a Bitcoin will one day be a millionaire. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vuBEuuluCjeDh5TRKt0Uy6yDt_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729637/akrales_210615_4628_0976.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FreeTalk Live radio co-host Aria DiMezzo is facing unlicensed money transmittal charges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nhOO1L"&gt;For true believers like Freeman, that shift has been bittersweet. “There’s nothing wrong with somebody seeing it from that perspective and just wanting to invest in a thing and be successful,” Freeman tells me. “But in the libertarian Bitcoin community up here, they see it differently. They see it as a dramatic transfer of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qkb9F"&gt;But if Mt. Gox and the Silk Road represented a transfer of power, the power is now shifting back the other way. In 2017, international raids took down BTC-e (then the largest unregulated exchange), with a money laundering sting revealed the following year. An Ohio man was arrested last year for running a Bitcoin tumbler called Helix, which mixed blockchain records with obscure transactions; a month after the New Hampshire raid, a Russian-Swedish national was arrested for running a similar service called Bitcoin Fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OctrU"&gt;In public statements, prosecutors refer to these as “darknet” cases, treating the unregulated Bitcoin system as a loosely organized criminal conspiracy. There is a lot of tainted money on the blockchain: money from drug sales, online scams, or stolen from individual users as part of a breach. Tumblers and anonymous exchanges let criminals escape with that money, so law enforcement agencies are trying to shut them down one by one, like plugging holes in a dam. With so much dirty money trying to get clean, the prosecutions take on a kind of fatalist logic. Any unregulated exchange will eventually be used for money-laundering; any unmonitored flow of coins will eventually be an accomplice to a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSYDsc"&gt;For the Keene project, keeping those coins unmonitored was the whole point. Their goal was to maintain the privacy and freedom of Bitcoin’s original design while staying just inside the bounds of the law. But to the federal government, it just looked like one more hole to be plugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OLkxdb"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gBauwi"&gt;By the end of May, both Freeman and DiMezzo were out on bail, with the trial scheduled for October 2022. Freeman announced his release with a wry blog post on the Shire Society message board: &lt;a href="https://forum.shiresociety.com/t/after-significant-delays-hostage-takers-release-ian-from-from-merrimack-county-spiritual-retreat/12666"&gt;“After Significant Delays Hostage Takers Release Ian From From Merrimack County Spiritual Retreat.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVQmV3"&gt;The conditions of the bail are stringent, befitting the aftermath of the raid: they can’t leave their homes, trade Bitcoin, or communicate with other co-defendants. That last provision created significant problems for &lt;em&gt;Free Talk Live&lt;/em&gt;, since it meant the main two co-hosts could no longer speak to each other without risking more jail time. Within a few weeks, the court granted a relief order letting them talk for the purposes of coordinating the show, and the show returned to its usual troublemaking. By the end of July, they were drumming up support for a ballot measure that would allow New Hampshire to secede from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byjha9"&gt;Nobody took a more adversarial stance toward the legal system and stayed in jail for months longer. According to court records, his calls with the public defender broke down into screaming matches. After two weeks in jail, he made a phone call so alarming that it halted his efforts for pretrial release. The recording itself is sealed, but a filing gives alarming titles for the exhibits, including “audio clip — needs to die,” “audio clip — start shooting pigs,” and “audio clip — kill himself if sentenced.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mt058S"&gt;Prosecutors say he made threats against his public defender’s life, and the public defender withdrew from the case the next day, putting the bail hearing on hold. As last as August, he was still in jail. Supporters rallied outside the corrections building, waving signs that said “Free Nobody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y3YHdkK03rZOt11pkHr09fhS_hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729627/akrales_210614_4628_0553.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christopher Waid, a crypto activist, filmed the raids on both Freeman’s house and the Bitcoin Embassy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8QXr0"&gt;Freeman’s cohort had always lived at the margins of the broader Free State Project — but after the arrest, a new wave of libertarian activism sprung up around him. The Free Keene website became a flurry of daily news about bail hearings and protests. Waid &lt;a href="https://thecrypto6.com/"&gt;started a website&lt;/a&gt; to support “the Crypto6,” as he called them. Soon, T-shirts bearing the name were a regular sight around town. A longtime Free State activist named Dave Ridley started organizing jail rallies, lending more local credibility to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFwdhM"&gt;As the jail rallies tapered off, Ridley turned to a more ostentatious kind of activism: branding himself as “Bitcoin Gandhi” and launching a 24-day march from Keene to Concord dressed in robes in a historically accurate Gandhi costume. A string of YouTube videos show him walking down the narrow shoulders of two-lane highways, picking up trash and occasionally being questioned by confused but genial highway patrollers. In an open letter to the head of New England’s General Services Agency, Ridley called for the federal government to distance itself from the case, saying, “escalations of this type indicate a Venezuelan-style slide into currency-fascism.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The month after, Ridley’s Gandhi alter ego took part in another protest outside the Concord federal building with Mr. Bitcoin, a Mr. Met-style foam suit embodiment of a physical Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzxxKM"&gt;Freeman was familiar with this kind of civil disobedience, acting out to showcase the brutality of the carceral status quo. Years earlier, Freeman had sold marijuana on the main street of Keene, daring local cops to arrest him for a crime that usually goes unpunished. (A friend filmed the encounter from across the street.) A longer running gag is Freeman’s refusal to pay municipal fines, litigating every parking ticket or summons until the bureaucracy finds it easier to simply give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKWdL2"&gt;Looking at his Bitcoin business, it can be hard to tell where that activism ends and the straightforward business begins. Freeman’s machines were real, and he was making money by building out cryptocurrency infrastructure like any entrepreneur. But he arranged the business in a self-consciously risky way, avoiding financial licensing and other measures that insulate many Bitcoin businesses from prosecution. Even more than his Wall Street competitors, Freeman was deeply familiar with cryptocurrency prosecutions. He knew that his Bitcoin dispenser left him exposed, but it never slowed him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s0GfNo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was on a mission to spread Bitcoin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ezul7Z"&gt;Freeman believes he was under investigation as early as 2016, when he says a federal agent approached Renee Spinella with questions about Freeman’s Bitcoin dealings. Spinella refused to inform on Freeman; she and her husband were among the six arrested during the raids. But it was an ominous sign, the first indication of a federal case against Freeman’s Bitcoin business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDkYtF"&gt;Still, it wasn’t enough to make Freeman drop the project. As he tells it, his Bitcoin work was too important to give up, a kind of moral crusade against the American state and its ability to wage war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX7hoV"&gt;“I was on a mission to spread Bitcoin,” Freeman says. “To give people an opportunity to get out of this government money system that funds evil and funds violence and funds war. Dollar by dollar, people need to get out of that system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ehlMw"&gt;Freeman also didn’t think the FBI could make a case. “We believed that this was legal,” he says. “There was a legal opinion written by our church attorney that looked at both federal and state regulations and he said, this is just a sale of a product; this isn’t money transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Poo6Yt"&gt;That opinion, prepared by the Shire Free Church, rests on a unique technical point that makes Freeman’s Bitcoin dispensers more like vending machines than an ATM. The machines look like a Cupertino-fried version of your standard cash machine, but each one holds its own wallet, akin to a stash of Bitcoins held physically inside the machine. So instead of transmitting your money from somewhere else, Freeman argues it’s merely dispensing a locally controlled inventory. It’s a clever distinction, although one can see how the FBI might not be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_WaLyg5aQC5NwxpaJ436asEj-A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729635/akrales_210615_4628_0735.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Bitcoin Cash sticker remains on the door to the Campus Convenience store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kVZFZr"&gt;Freeman was operating the business openly and the New Hampshire Banking Department never told him to shut it down, but he kept receiving ominous signs from law enforcement. Earlier this year, he was cultivated by a stranger who claimed to be a drug dealer — and who Freeman believes was actually an undercover FBI agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLwBm5"&gt;“This guy had been a Bitcoin buyer, seemed like a decent guy. He’d shown up at one of our crypto meetups,” Freeman says. “He wasn’t even talking to me personally, but I was within earshot and I heard him say he was a heroin and ecstasy dealer and it was like, ‘Red alert! We have a possible fed here! You’re either a federal agent or you’re a fucking moron.’” Freeman says he recognized the legal danger and refused to sell to the man, thinking he’d avoided a money laundering charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPY1Na"&gt;But if Freeman was ready to butt heads with the federal government, he wasn’t ready for the dramatic violence of the raid. “They could have just come and knocked,” Freeman says. “No one had to get their windows busted in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaagWO"&gt;He also wasn’t ready for the full scope of the charges. Reviewing the case now, he’s particularly alarmed by the charge of operating a “continuing financial crimes enterprise,” which was levied against him specifically. It seems to have been triggered by the Shire Free Church allegedly bringing in more than $5 million in gross receipts over two years, which puts it in a different class of criminal organization. When we spoke, Freeman was still expecting more charges to emerge from ongoing grand jury proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEfOuO"&gt;“It was worse than I expected it to be,” he tells me. “And they’re not done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="FmD02o"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="d3dgpC"&gt;Once DiMezzo was released, one of her biggest surprises was the bail restriction on Bitcoin. It’s a reasonable request from prosecutors — you can’t let an accused diamond smuggler sell diamonds — but it’s meant a huge change in her lifestyle because, unlike most cryptocurrency enthusiasts, DiMezzo actually uses Bitcoin as money. She tells me she made about 80 percent of her purchases directly off the blockchain before the arrest, either through intermediary services like AnyPay or through the range of businesses in the Keene area that have been talked into accepting Bitcoin payments. DiMezzo says she could eat at a different restaurant every night and always pay in crypto. This isn’t how Bitcoin works for most people and it can feel like Keene’s crypto mecca is a kind of island, blissfully cut off from the broader motion of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO5Z2V"&gt;After the raid, the island is shrinking. In a phone call from the Merrimack jail, Freeman’s co-host Nobody spoke to me bitterly about Bitcoin developers’ refusal to increase the block size, a disagreement that ultimately led to the 2017 Bitcoin Cash split. His side lost that fight — the block size didn’t change, pushing the price of Bitcoin up while on-blockchain transactions got slower and slower. The Keene contingent still uses Bitcoin Cash where possible or fully anonymous alternatives like Monero, but it’s a much harder sell than Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibjtVu"&gt;The financial side of Bitcoin (the side you would find partying in Miami) isn’t interested in Bitcoin Cash. They don’t care about on-chain transactions or anonymity or anything else that would add friction to the vast sums of money pouring into cryptocurrency. For most of the new arrivals, Bitcoin is about profit, not politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzGpok"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They probably won’t speak up in any of our cases”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYjf8a"&gt;“There’s that division,” Freeman says, “between the people who want to be regulated and controlled and people who see [cryptocurrency] as a new freedom that we have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoaHGs"&gt;That division is particularly stark after the raids, now that supporters are trying to raise money and awareness. It would be a good time to have rich and powerful friends, but Freeman doesn’t have any expectation that the institutional Bitcoin world will step in. “They probably won’t speak up in any of our cases,” Freeman tells me. “We’re irrelevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV5gsa"&gt;Bitcoin was born as a way to escape from all this, to build a monetary system outside the reach of the dollar, the Fed, or the government. That was the dream that first drew Freeman into Bitcoin, before it was any more plausible of an investment than gold-laced currency or silver coins. In the decade since, Silicon Valley and Wall Street have gotten friendlier with Bitcoin, and prosecutors have learned how to tame it — but Freeman sees the same dream of escape still living beneath it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SC8jl"&gt;“They’re gonna regulate the exchanges,” he says. “We know that. They’re going to regulate the banks, wherever else they can apply pressure… But regardless of how much effort they put into trying to control cryptocurrency, it will fail because of the decentralized nature of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjKZ9n"&gt;It is a point of almost religious faith for him. No matter how hard the clampdown, it will be incomplete. The wilder forces will survive just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nod hosts ditch Spotify to relaunch their original show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuq5zi9gLmM4ucBbGH5-U0L7Qr4=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69665964/08_eric_brittany_duo_look03_005r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: For Colored Nerds hosts Eric Eddings and Brittany Luse | SiriusXM/Stitcher&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6sN7Zv"&gt;The co-hosts of &lt;em&gt;The Nod&lt;/em&gt; are back, and this time, they’ve separated from Gimlet Media and Spotify and are instead taking their work to SiriusXM’s Stitcher. Brittany Luse and Eric Eddings tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that they’re relaunching their Black culture show &lt;em&gt;For Colored Nerds&lt;/em&gt; this fall, which they created, hosted, and produced prior to working at Gimlet. The podcast will be available widely and isn’t exclusive to one platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpLF2j"&gt;Stitcher will produce the show along with them, and SXM Media will exclusively sell ads for it. The co-hosts last published a &lt;em&gt;For Colored Nerds&lt;/em&gt; episode in 2017, but the same feed will be revived for the comeback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMfY2E"&gt;Notably, Eddings and Luse retain total control over their show — they own the audio masters, the feed, and rights to derivative works — and they’ve landed on a revenue sharing agreement with Sirius. (The specifics of the deal, like how much Stitcher paid them to come over and the percentage of ad revenue they’ll receive, weren’t disclosed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gboCA9"&gt;“I can’t tell you how great it feels to be able to have the type of flexibility, and independence, and true support, that we have right now,” Luse says in a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The industry is no longer in its infancy; the industry’s maturing, and so I think people’s desires for what they’re looking for out of ownership deals and things like that are changing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cUfcpe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Luse and Edding’s ‘For Colored Nerds’ show will return this fall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qlSV3B"&gt;The ownership part of the deal was especially critical for Luse and Eddings, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308074/the-nod-spotify-rss-feed-another-round-buzzfeed-podcast-ownership"&gt;spoke out in June 2020&lt;/a&gt; about their frustration with Gimlet’s control over &lt;em&gt;The Nod&lt;/em&gt;’s feed and IP. The two pitched, hosted, and produced the show and felt like they owned it, but they never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkotXi"&gt;“Providing institutional support is not the same as producing the actual product,” Luse says in this recent chat. “So I think that eventually the industry is going to have to bend toward a situation where there are organizations that are providing institutional support to people who want to make quality audio without demanding that they also hand over all of their ownership.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTSaGf"&gt;The industry still faces challenges around IP and ownership, even if it’s a top-of-mind issue. The Ringer and Gimlet unions strived to reach an agreement on IP, but weren’t able to secure anything in their final contract with Spotify. In &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/08/the-state-of-collective-bargaining-in-podcasting.html"&gt;a chat with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;’s Nick Quah last August, prior to any finalized contracts, Lowell Peterson, executive director of the Writers Guild of America East, called fighting for IP rights an “uphill battle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHKfip"&gt;“Having some ability to share in the fruits of the creative labor and maybe even exploit it on your own or stay with it either financially or creatively if it becomes something bigger… yes, that’s definitely been an issue,” he said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ONOjd"&gt;And Eddings acknowledged in our recent chat that more resources need to be readily available to independent creators who might not know how to get started with creating, pitching, and ultimately owning a show, especially when negotiating with massive corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpSiOG"&gt;“I feel like we have to whisper sometimes in terms of asking about a lawyer,” he says as one example. “It needs to become a thing that that is normalized and standardized because it’s super important.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube ‘Premium Lite’ subscription offers ad-free viewing for less</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6NECyPc8xuv3SWADeaSNCuItoQ=/0x0:1622x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69665466/image__13_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Premium Lite offers ad-free viewing at a lower price.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/premiumlite" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRLkpV"&gt;Google is piloting a more affordable premium subscription tier for YouTube that offers ad-free viewing without YouTube Premium’s other features like offline downloads or background playback. The new “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/premiumlite"&gt;Premium Lite&lt;/a&gt;” plan was &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-youtube-premium-lite-ad-free-sub-is-a-thing-now-in-select-countries.465198/"&gt;spotted by a user on ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;, and YouTube subsequently confirmed the test offering in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Premium Lite is currently being tested in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkVuqp"&gt;“In Nordics and Benelux (except for Iceland), we’re testing a new offering to give users even more choice: Premium Lite costs €6.99/month (or local equivalent per month) and it includes ad-free videos on YouTube,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. In comparison, YouTube’s existing Premium plan costs around €11.99 a month in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Z0wbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re testing a new offering to give users even more choice”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQkv3n"&gt;Premium Lite includes ad-free viewing across YouTube’s main app on web, iOS, Android, smart TVs, and games consoles, as well as in the YouTube Kids app. However, it doesn’t include any YouTube Music benefits like ad-free listening, and it doesn’t include &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6308116?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cyoutube-music-premium%2Cyoutube-originals"&gt;Premium’s other features&lt;/a&gt; like background playback (for when you want to switch to another app while continuing to listen to audio from a YouTube video), or offline downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV8IOv"&gt;Speaking as someone who hates the amount of ads on YouTube, but isn’t too interested in Premium’s other features like offline downloads, Premium Lite sounds like a tempting proposition. But at its current pricing, it costs around 60 percent of the price of a regular Premium subscription, while only offering around a quarter of its benefits. YouTube says that the current subscription is in an experimental phase, however, and that it’s considering rolling out more plans based on audience feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Nintendo World’s Donkey Kong zone may already be under construction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUkekS8BCLBvuX2U2CaCLCvVYD4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69665314/DSCF7652.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The door that may lead to Super Nintendo World’s Donkey Kong-themed area. | Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gLFVPC"&gt;Super Nintendo World, the Super Mario-themed area of Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;finally opened&lt;/a&gt; back in March after multiple delays, and Nintendo may already be working on expanding the park. As &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/construction-has-started-on-nintendos-donkey-kong-theme-park-world/"&gt;noted by VGC&lt;/a&gt;, social media posts from recent visitors to USJ have shown cranes, scaffolding, and a jungle-themed backdrop around Super Nintendo World, suggesting work is underway on the rumored Donkey Kong area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAw1cp"&gt;Neither Nintendo nor Universal have ever announced the Donkey Kong plans, but they’ve been rumored for many years. Leaked early concept imagery for Super Nintendo World included plans for a separate Donkey Kong-themed zone, including a mine cart-style roller coaster. Upon opening, Super Nintendo World was solely Mario-themed, but there is a conspicuously large locked door (above) that looks like it could serve as an entrance to a Donkey Kong-styled section of the park. DK assets have also been datamined from the USJ app, hinting at the addition of extra in-park collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="31A7MI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ja" dir="ltr"&gt;7月上旬&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4枚目の看板は東にも西にも存在するのね笑 &lt;a href="https://t.co/FVMS7WFhTv"&gt;https://t.co/FVMS7WFhTv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/rKl5x9eGJI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rKl5x9eGJI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ひび  @テーマパーク垢 (@Hibirobo_Disney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hibirobo_Disney/status/1416334691498528770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kWI3AQ"&gt;Donkey Kong is a natural fit for the existing Super Nintendo World park. Mario first appeared in the original &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/em&gt; arcade game, of course, and Donkey Kong in turn shows up in games like &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; and the various Mario-themed sports series. As such, the addition shouldn’t compromise the feeling that Super Nintendo World is one cohesive park. However, it does mean that the park isn’t really covering the full breadth of Nintendo’s IP, with some omissions like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; feeling particularly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="20yaOO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Super Nintendo World is sensory overload","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YsogfJ"&gt;Universal also plans to open Nintendo areas at its parks in Hollywood, Orlando, and Singapore, but it’s yet to be confirmed when construction on any of them will be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google soon won’t let you sign in on very old Android devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpgtxTZThD20c-Ja_SCEptRMXC4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69664644/wjoel_180413_1777_android_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pz8PS"&gt;If you still have a device running Android 2.3.7 (the final version of Gingerbread) or older, Google won’t let you sign in to your Google account on that device starting September 27th, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/android/thread/118703101/sign-in-on-android-devices-running-android-2-3-7-or-lower-will-not-be-allowed-starting-september-27?hl=en"&gt;according to a support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/08/google-to-block-sign-ins-for-android-2-3-and-lower.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Liliputing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36lFPe"&gt;“As part of our ongoing efforts to keep our users safe, Google will no longer allow sign-in on Android devices that run Android 2.3.7 or lower starting September 27, 2021,” the company says. “If you sign into your device after September 27, you may get username or password errors when you try to use Google products and services like Gmail, YouTube, and Maps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fhHc1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android 2.3.7 was released nearly 10 years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4nlU6"&gt;To give you an idea of just how old a device will be affected by this change, Android 2.3.7 was released nearly 10 years ago. But given that there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440813/android-devices-active-number-smartphones-google-2021"&gt;more than three billion active Android devices in the wild&lt;/a&gt; right now, this change will likely affect more than a few people who might still be holding on to older tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QabksW"&gt;If you’re on Android 2.3.7 or older after that September 27th deadline, you’ll still be able to use some Google services if you’re logged in on your device’s browser, according to Google. But devices on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) will continue to be able to log in to Google accounts, the company says, so if your older device can be updated, you might want to do that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square to buy Afterpay, which offers a ‘buy now, pay later’ service, for $29 billion in stock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9v_3sKk5afS1qxDsWV1FZBDf55g=/0x130:3360x2370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69664506/sq_online_store_phone.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somebody using a Square product on their phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Square&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHL0ar"&gt;Square plans to acquire Australian company &lt;a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-US"&gt;Afterpay&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a “buy now, pay later” service that lets you pay for purchases in installments interest-free, for $29 billion in stock, &lt;a href="http://squareinc2020ir.q4web.com/news/news-details/2021/Square-Inc.-Announces-Plans-to-Acquire-Afterpay-Strengthening-and-Enabling-Further-Integration-Between-its-Seller-and-Cash-App-Ecosystems/default.aspx"&gt;the two companies announced Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest big move for Square, which has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579359/jack-dorsey-tbd-open-source-defi-crypto-square-bitcoin"&gt;a Bitcoin business unit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;that it bought a majority stake in the Tidal streaming service&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GerhZq"&gt;“Buy now, pay later” services like those offered by Afterpay, Affirm, and Klarna have become increasingly prevalent across the web. And Square may not be the only payments giant jumping into the ring, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575852/apple-pay-later-report-affirm-paypal-klarna-monthly-installments"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a similar service of its own&lt;/a&gt; that’s internally called “Apple Pay Later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G1YAoz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7QKE6F"&gt;Afterpay already serves more than 16 million customers and nearly 100,000 merchants across the world, according to a press release. Square and Afterpay expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2022. Once the acquisition is completed, Square will appoint an Afterpay director to join Square’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayhgZQ"&gt;“Square and Afterpay have a shared purpose. We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles,” Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement. “Together, we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers, putting the power back in their hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Galaxy Watch photos show Samsung and Google’s new smartwatch OS on an actual device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jmP1e0d2Ik3E5OnZNZcrhQWIo0=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69664249/samsung_galaxy_watch_4_featured_watermarked.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos of the rumored Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-design-revealed-live-images/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lb6vO"&gt;We’re a little over a week away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;from Samsung’s next Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-design-revealed-live-images/"&gt;new photos from &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may have revealed our first in-person look at two things we could see at the show: the rumored Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and the new smartwatch OS from Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qwk8h0"&gt;The two photos from &lt;em&gt;91moblies&lt;/em&gt; show off black and silver watches with rounded bezels, matching a design seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;leaked renders from &lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;detailed GIFs posted by noted leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; in July. Perhaps more significantly, the photos show the new smartwatch OS (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"&gt;currently referred to as Wear&lt;/a&gt;) on actual devices for the first time. But disappointingly, there isn’t much to see — just an initial setup screen and a screen asking the user to set the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQliy8"&gt;Google and Samsung announced they would be essentially merging Wear OS and Tizen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;at Google I/O in May&lt;/a&gt;, promising improvements to battery life, faster app loading times, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"&gt;and other more&lt;/a&gt;. And in May, Samsung gave us an idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;of what the new OS will look like on its devices&lt;/a&gt; (and it looks great in what the company showed, if you ask me). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaYM_axvOnfGnf-_7FrVk8DI7Z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22754816/One_UI_Watch_App_Ecosystem_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hz4AXe"&gt;While Samsung’s teases for August 11th’s Unpacked &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/events/unpacked/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hint strongly toward new foldables&lt;/a&gt;, the company has revealed new smartwatches at previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754898/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-5g-book-s-pen-unpacked-event-2019-biggest-announcements-news-recap"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21350066/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-note-20-event-biggest-announcements-products-recap"&gt;Unpacked&lt;/a&gt; events, so it’s possible we could see a new smartwatch next week. And based on other recent leaks, Samsung may announce &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; smartwatch as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;the Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ariana Grande is headlining Fortnite’s next concert series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xwyvkRrEXYcbClHY6Zai8Ndyv-k=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663897/Ariana_x_Fortnite_Key_Art_3.15.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LpUwK6"&gt;Last week, Epic Games teased that a “record-breaking superstar” would be performing in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599908/fortnite-rift-tour-concert-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; upcoming Rift Tour concert series&lt;/a&gt;, and now we know that the mystery performer is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1421894007697952775"&gt;none other than Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22YDkD"&gt;The five-show concert series kicks off August 6th at 6PM ET, and shows will run through August 8th. (&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-rift-tour-featuring-ariana-grande"&gt;You can find the full schedule here&lt;/a&gt;.) Epic recommends being ready in-game 60 minutes before any of the performances so that you can jump into the Rift Tour playlist when it goes live 30 minutes ahead of showtime. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; events have filled up in the past — I personally missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; “The Device” event&lt;/a&gt; in-game because I signed on too late — so I’d recommend showing up early to the Rift Tour shows just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eLfyLw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="et" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rifttour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rifttour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;august 6-8&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FortniteGame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mlf5Xpl9HO"&gt;https://t.co/Mlf5Xpl9HO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/pTgLJ7e67O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pTgLJ7e67O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1421893658689814531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5e5Mw"&gt;As for what you can expect from the shows? “Building on and incorporating other celebrated &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; moments, the Rift Tour will begin with experiences that pair popular tracks with moments based on elements from the game,” &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/ariana-grande-steps-into-the-metaverse-as-the-headliner-for-fortnites-rift-tour"&gt;according to Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. “Players will be able to travel side by side with their friends on a journey to magical new realities where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Ariana collide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orBgKT"&gt;Epic will also be selling a skin based on Grande as part of its Icon Series, which features real-world celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt;. Grande’s skin will go on sale August 4th at 8PM ET, meaning you can show up to Grande’s concert dressed as Grande, and you can get a preview of the skin and a backpack based on her &lt;a href="https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Piggy_Smallz"&gt;actual pet pig, Piggy Smallz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBjRi_UNY8o"&gt;in this teaser video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uFDrYb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBjRi_UNY8o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rB6Wvs"&gt;If you attend the concert, you’ll also get a special umbrella glider. Players who subscribe to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612524/fortnite-crew-subscription-chapter-2-season-5-price-release-date"&gt;monthly &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Crew subscription&lt;/a&gt; will get some exclusive bonuses for attending, including a rainbow variant of the concert umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ptdx3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; past concerts have been massively successful — more than 10 million people watched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello’s in-game concert in February 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;more than 12 million people attended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott’s surreal &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; performance in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It seems likely that Epic will be aiming to up the spectacle with this latest concert, and we’ll have to wait and see what the combination Grande’s performance inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;currently alien-themed world&lt;/a&gt; could bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5Eqeo"&gt;Grande’s performance &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;was rumored in July&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-04-fortnite-planned-metroid-crossover-ariana-and-lady-gaga-concerts"&gt;documents unearthed as part of Epic’s case against Apple&lt;/a&gt; also revealed that Epic was planning a concert with the megastar. The event seems to have been in the works for quite some time — according to a June 2020 document from the case, a Grande concert was in the works for that October. At the time, a J Balvin concert was set for that September, which ended up happening a month later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21525028/fortnite-fortnitemares-halloween-event-jbalvin-concert"&gt;as part of the game’s Halloween event&lt;/a&gt;, while a still-unannounced Lady Gaga concert was planned for that December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RryrLs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 1st, 2:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added description from Epic Games about the performances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jungle Cruise earned a third of its opening revenues from Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKc9Mf8X5WLbVP1oPCIrfKCp9PM=/103x0:1198x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663835/g_junglecruise_18970_1_bb702394.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in Disney’s &lt;/em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crska5"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; debuted in theaters and as a Disney Plus Premier Access title this weekend, and early revenue totals from the entertainment giant show that streaming accounted for a third of the film’s revenues, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jungle-cruise-box-office-disney-green-knight-1234991247/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sunday’s &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; numbers mark the second time Disney has released figures for a movie offered as part of the Premier Access program, which lets Disney Plus subscribers pay $30 to stream certain films the same day they hit theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4NTGZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; $30 million is half of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;$60 million &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; earned on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; over the same period following its early July debut, but &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; Disney Plus revenue represented a bigger slice of the total revenue pie than streaming did for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow’s:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; $30 million was about 33 percent of its $91.8 million total, while &lt;em&gt;Black Widow’s&lt;/em&gt; $60 million was about 27 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/black-widow-disney-revenue-game-changer-1234980611/"&gt;its $218.8 million total&lt;/a&gt;. Premier Access was also an option for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;2020’s &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315306/disney-raya-and-the-last-dragon-southeast-asian-media"&gt;March’s &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400212/cruella-review-disney-plus-emma-stone-101-dalmatians"&gt;May’s &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but Disney hasn’t shared figures for those movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wBo7cH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The numbers arrive just days after Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit over Black Widow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HP63Kw"&gt;The new numbers also arrive just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Scarlett Johansson’s major lawsuit against Disney&lt;/a&gt;, which alleged that Disney reneged on a promise to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; exclusively in theaters. The lawsuit is perhaps the biggest pushback yet against the direct-to-streaming model — &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;Denis Villeneuve blasted WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; in December after the studio announced it would release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;all of its 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amc-is-pissed-1845804062"&gt;theaters weren’t a fan of that move, either&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbPEC3"&gt;While WarnerMedia has already announced plans to release 10 Warner Bros. films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;day-and-date in theaters and on streaming services in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, Disney hasn’t announced any Premier Access titles that may follow &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GETtQ1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jungle Cruise desperately wants to be The Mummy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595789/jungle-cruise-review-disney-plus"},{"title":"Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney over Black Widow’s streaming release","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"},{"title":"Dune director Denis Villeneuve blasts AT&amp;amp;T and Warner Bros. for ‘hijacking’ films ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"},{"title":"HBO Max will release 10 Warner Bros. films straight-to-streaming in 2022 ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Elite students are debating hot-button issues on an invite-only TikTok clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foOi8WK2cGa90FmG5DZ4faenTK8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663095/VRG_4679_Polemix_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;To combat online polarization, Polemix aims to make young people ‘listen to the outside’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="PPaNzb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap c-end-para" id="V0DW5A"&gt;At a glance, the video looks like a TikTok. But toward the bottom, where a TikTok’s caption would be, are two large buttons. One reads “Respect But Disagree.” The other reads “Convinced By You.” Across the top is a question, written in white: “Should Dems pack the Court?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmeBE2"&gt;“Hell no,” declares a young woman, whom the app labels “Naomi, Political Science” onscreen. “If Republicans are elected in the future, they’re now going to be more likely to stack the court as well.” Swipe up and “Brian, Founder, Oxford Political Review” appears to express an opposing viewpoint. “As much as I believe Democrats ought uphold norms of civility or neutrality and all that, in theory, look: The reality is it’s dirty, and it’s time we fight back,” Brian declares. Brian’s video is the top-voted video on court-packing, having earned a combined 17 “Respect But Disagree” and “Convinced By You” votes since its posting. Naomi’s video is in fourth place, with four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naomi says, “Hell no.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t8U4h9"&gt;This is Polemix, a new, exclusive app aimed at promoting free discourse among young people. As the world’s biggest social networks continuously battle misinformation and draw controversial lines between dangerous and appropriate speech, the founders of Polemix believe they’ve found a better solution: a free market of ideas, with selective admission. So far, the app has attracted a young community that’s eloquent, outspoken, and passionate about the app’s stated philosophy. But it has also served as a microcosmic experiment with online debate culture in concentrated form, and a real-world demonstration of the caveats required to bring such a lofty ideal to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="S5b17g"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RLcKAP"&gt;“Naomi” is Naomi Panovka, a rising third-year student at McGill. “Brian” is Brian Wong, a Rhodes scholar studying politics at Oxford. The two were selected earlier this year as part of a group that Polemix’s founders refer to as “Leaders” — 40 elite young people who were tasked with building the app’s community while driving its early dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT39al"&gt;“It was people who are quite passionate about public speaking in general, who cared about discourse,” Panovka says. “People who they thought would be good representatives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twdC2K"&gt;There was no formal application to become a Leader — the founders hand-picked the group through their networks. Per Polemix’s website, the cadre includes “some of the world’s top thinkers.” The founders describe them as “very carefully selected university leaders.” In practice, the vast majority of the &lt;a href="https://polemix.co/leaders"&gt;listed group&lt;/a&gt; are decorated high school and college debaters. Panovka competed for Canada’s national team in high school and has reached the finals of over 10 university-level competitions; Wong was a semifinalist at the 2020 world championships. The group is diverse when it comes to race, gender, and nationality, but famous universities are heavily represented. Cambridge, Oxford, LSE, and Yale all make several appearances on the list and can claim a majority of the listed Leaders as students or alumni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDdOLg"&gt;College debate was formative for Polemix founder and CEO Ian Sielecki. He competed during his time as a student at Cambridge and has organized public debates for the Athens Democracy Forum. Sielecki has long felt that social media could learn from the college debate scene; he sees Polemix as a tool to combat online echo chambers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxHItX"&gt;“Social networks, by the way they operate through their algorithms, they only give you content that you already agree with, which means they radicalize you,” says Sielecki. The idea behind Polemix, he says, “was to create, inspired from the magic of debating, a conceptual landscape in which people would hear, listen to the outside by design.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t a Leader, you can’t create new questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNDGaG"&gt;Early on, Sielecki and his team identified young people as their target audience. Specifically, “young people passionate about something,” according to Ismaël Emelien, Sielecki’s co-founder. Emelien isn’t a college debater, but rather a cofounder of France’s En Marche political party and a former adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron. But he feels that Sielecki’s frustrations map to the global political landscape. “People just ... can’t listen to the other side anymore,” Emelien says. “This is the first thing we need to fix in real life. The way to do that is to target young people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEtJ3g"&gt;Polemix’s interface borrows a lot from TikTok — swipe down for a new video, everything capped at 30 seconds — but the content couldn’t be more different. Every Polemix video features a person making an argument for or against a preset list of questions, from “Will Federer win Wimbledon?” and “Is Canada superior to America?” to “Does Instagram objectify women?” and “Is physician-assisted suicide unethical?” As a user scrolls, they’re shown videos for each question in groups of up to four: a “Hell Yes,” a “Hell No,” a “Hell Yes,” a “Hell No.” They can vote, or scroll, accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMlY79"&gt;The algorithm takes both “Convinced By You” and “Respect But Disagree” votes into account when prioritizing the videos you see. As Sielecki notes, “The Respect But Disagree is quite important for your video to be popular.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bcUEKv"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nbw2Bo"&gt;Every social media platform grapples with harassment and outright hate speech, but Polemix walks a particularly difficult line because its explicit goal is to celebrate differences of opinion. The app does have an explicit rule against hate speech: “Hate is for losers” is its slogan, one that Sielecki emphasizes in pitching the app, and one that was attractive to some of the initial members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3Yogs"&gt;“The idea is to welcome people from every side of every controversial question. We will have people from the Trump administration, from QAnon making videos,” Emelien says. “That’s not a problem for us, as long as it is expressed in respect for the rules of Polemix, meaning it’s not hateful.” He emphasizes that “the people watching this video will be exposed, by design, to the other side arguing against those videos ... That’s our remedy.” (Of course, that also means a user won’t necessarily see a representative sample of opinions. “Has #MeToo gone too far?” has 10 “Hell No” responses and just four “Hell Yes” responses, but a scrolling user will still see two of each — arguably giving more contrarian views an easier path to exposure.) &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the statistics for a question on Polemix: “Do public figures have a right to privacy?” A graph labeled “Convinced votes” shows 64 percent Yes and 36 percent No. A graph labeled “People showing Respect” shows 43 percent Yes.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For each question, you can view the percent of viewers who were convinced, and the percent who selected “Respect But Disagree.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Polemix’s list of debatable questions. Each leader is credited for their question. Questions include: Is it cruel to have a baby today (by Samuel Hvitse), Is Jagger greater than Lennon (by Judith Goldenthale), Should the US be more socialist (by Matt Caito), Should we abolish prisons (by Sharon Chau), Are the Tokyo Olympics a dangerous idea (by Roshan Melwani), and Should NCAA athletes be paid?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4KxN7_eptmdO-WA1DewxFJK48I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733739/217511736_600116368043527_1559460927487504693_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When creating a new video, you’re prompted to select a question from a preset list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SEdiQu"&gt;The other tool reining in the discourse is the questions users are asked to respond to, which set the tone for the conversations that follow. For Polemix’s first few months, only Leaders have been able to create new questions, a major privilege that sets them apart from the rest of the community. Many of the Leaders are acquainted through the debate community and discuss new questions behind the scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CcvE6"&gt;Sielecki and Emelien agree that some questions are so conducive to bigotry as to be off-limits; debates about “race science,” no matter how respectful, would be a no-go. Asked how the team goes about drawing that line, Sielecki replied, “It’s relatively clear what racism is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKQKjM"&gt;But the app has touched on just about every controversial issue you might think of, and some questions that have gotten the green light would likely be in a gray area, if not over the line, for progressive circles on and off the internet. “Should Cosby be left in peace?”, “Is Pride Day still necessary?”, “Should IQ tests be mandatory?”, “Is JK Rowling transphobic?”, “Has political correctness gone too far?”, “Is America racist?”, “Did COVID leak from a Wuhan lab?”, and “Did religion get homosexuality wrong?” have all been debated on Polemix since the app’s founding. Even with safeguards in place, founders who endorse these questions are drawing an ideological line, however unconsciously — one that puts a high degree of trust in their community. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Polemix’s website showing four people beneath the heading “Leaders of all opinions and generations.” Below the pictures appears a question: “Are you afraid to listen to the other side?”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jYjLlQ_Q3Ht4Akk5JrNemUShM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733742/p6.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaders and their accomplishments are advertised on Polemix’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iLg4Kx"&gt;So far, Polemix has mostly avoided the right-wing lurch many might expect from a platform focused on quick-twitch debating. As of this writing, a “Hell yes” is winning “Should we tax to eliminate billionaires?” and “Should we have a universal basic income?”; a “Hell No” is winning “More restriction on immigration?” and “MLB too woke?” A “Hell Yes” is winning “Should we abolish prisons?” and “Should we abolish the police?” by a significant margin. None of the users I spoke to seem to have remotely right-wing political beliefs. Wong describes themself as “a hardcore progressive.” And the users I spoke to universally love Polemix’s environment and find the community supportive and engaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3RmZG"&gt;“It’s Reddit meets Twitter, but instead of Twitter trolls and Reddit downvoters who swarm you, you’ve just got high-quality or relatively high-quality discourse,” says Wong, who spends one to two hours on Polemix every day. “I’ve very rarely, if at all, seen any content that’s reminiscent of hate speech.” Sielecki and Emelien say they’ve had very few issues with trolls so far. “One out of every thousand is a hater,” Sielecki estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxGK2Q"&gt;Amanda Timerman, who’s not a leader (she learned about Polemix at a party), says the app’s intellectual community is “therapeutic” for her. “Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, everything there, it’s like the minute you say something ... you’re going to be immediately judged,” Timerman says. Polemix, she feels, is “really and truly a safe space ... It really makes me feel good, and it makes me feel really self-confident to have an opinion on things that normally I wouldn’t discuss.” She added, “It’s like my own personal talk show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSiH14"&gt;The prospect of young people hosting their own talk shows online isn’t always a recipe for enlightened discourse, as the swamp of online debate challenges demonstrates. The spectacle of those challenges has proven to be a good way for influencers to build hype and attract new audiences on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, but the debates themselves often take a back seat to clout-chasing. As popular Twitch commentator Hasan Piker put it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22556239/hasan-piker-twitch-gore-vidal-steven-crowder-sam-seder-h3-podcast-ethan-klein"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“[I]t’s just pseudo-intellectual wrestling. It’s sport, and it’s not productive ... People just want to beat their opponent, so they’re not necessarily ideologically shifting anyone. Instead, the 20 percent of the audience that is maybe malleable gravitates toward whoever the top-dog debater is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbCK8k"&gt;For Polemix, the challenge is to succeed where YouTube and Twitch have mostly failed: essentially, to build a platform where trolls don’t win. Polemix’s founders are confident in their algorithm, and so are the users I spoke to. “A lot of the social media debates that you see online — vitriolic, bitter, vicious, surly. It’s just not polite,” Wong says. But on Polemix, “It’s just people talking. And people talking humanely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJxrnP"&gt;But Polemix is still invite-only, with only 2,500 users (and a waitlist of “a couple of thousand,” per Sielecki), and it’s not clear how well the platform will fare if the reins are loosened. The founders are in the process of rolling out question-setting privileges to more users, and new Leaders will need to meet a minimum threshold of video views and votes. Emelien and Sielecki also plan to start adding more users soon — they recently offered invitations to all participants in the 2021 university world championships. They don’t, however, know if or when they’ll be letting the masses in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Polemix’s website. The text reads “Convince me if you can: Polemix brings together the world’s brightest youth and global leaders from both sides of any polarizing question. By invitation only.” Below are links to download the app if you have an invitation code, and to join the waiting list if you don’t. To the right are two phones playing Polemix videos." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/et-lPudOyfQLyJuPHTngntyAP-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733750/p7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Polemix brings together the world’s brightest youth.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5iUww7"&gt;“We ensure that we have quality every step of the way,” Sielecki says. “We’re not going to grow massively just to grow, without taking care of the safety that the ecosystem offers to users and the quality of the content that is being created.” In other words: there’s no timeline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwFawg"&gt;Among Leaders and members, there are some doubts about whether Polemix will be able to court non-debaters as it grows. Some members are nervous about changing the community’s character. “Right now, it kind of feels like I’m in a little cocoon,” Timerman says, though she’s aware that “the only way to grow is to eventually open it up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="n7n1JL"&gt;But Wong is confident enough in the community’s passion and values that they’re not worried about trolls. For them, the floodgates can’t open soon enough. “I’m very excited,” they say. “I can’t wait until we have unleashed the kraken.”&lt;/p&gt;
