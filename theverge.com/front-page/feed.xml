    <title>Dish adds HBO Max and will now offer HBO and Cinemax</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IKyeRW"&gt;Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055780/att-dish-hbo-battle-warnermedia-cable-streaming-battle-future"&gt;prolonged standoff&lt;/a&gt; between Dish Network and AT&amp;amp;T over licensing terms to carry HBO channels, Dish has reached an agreement with WarnerMedia to offer HBO, HBO Max, and Cinemax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6bjNb"&gt;Dish TV customers nationwide will be able to access both the HBO and Cinemax networks  today, though they’ll need to subscribe to HBO Max to get linear HBO. To promote the deal, Dish will run a free 10-day preview of the premium networks for existing customers right around the time the Olympics Games will be wrapping up, from August 6 to August 15. Customers don’t have to do anything to take advantage of the preview; the networks will appear automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvIfAn"&gt;Users interested in subscribing to HBO Max can score a discounted subscription to the service’s ad-free plan at $12 per month for up to a year if they sign up before October 27th. The service normally costs $15 per month without ads, or $10 per month if you don’t mind seeing ads on non-HBO titles. Cinemax will cost an additional $10 per month and will also include the 5-Star Max and More Max channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nkmgg"&gt;Potential subscribers should keep in mind that WarnerMedia is throwing all of its 2021 slate of films on the service, where they’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debut the same day&lt;/a&gt; they premiere in theaters. (However, its ad-supported tier &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/hbo-max-with-ads-10-mo-starting-in-june-and-guess-what-it-wont-include/#:~:text=That%20%245%2Fmo%20savings%20comes,%2C%20and%20The%20Suicide%20Squad)."&gt;will not include&lt;/a&gt; day-and-date releases like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;.) Subscribing to HBO Max will also unlock HBO as well as a handful of additional &lt;a href="https://my.dish.com/upgrades/premiums/hbomax"&gt;premium HBO channels&lt;/a&gt;, including HBO Family, HBO 2, HBO Latino, and HBO Signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCr1xb"&gt;HBO East, HBO West, HBO 2, and HBO Latino can be accessed with a satellite dish, and HBO Signature, HBO Family, and HBO on-demand content will require an internet-connected Hopper or Wally receiver. HBO Max is available across connected streaming devices and on most major platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vYCkE"&gt;The deal marks the end of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051390/dish-sling-tv-lose-hbo-distribution-agreement-dispute-blackout"&gt;dispute over distribution terms&lt;/a&gt; between AT&amp;amp;T and Dish that’s been ongoing since 2018, but it also arrives as HBO Max — and every streamer for that matter — looks to expand its subscriber base. The launch of HBO Max and its sister networks on Dish marks “a key addition to our distribution strategy for the platform,” Scott Miller, EVP of business and legal affairs for WarnerMedia, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Prime Day, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot drop to its lowest price of $25. However, it’s currently only available at full price at retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other info that is available for $60, the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the Kids Edition is currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers at full MSRP ($60). Amazon is selling a discounted bundle for $75, however, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Amazon does &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M1MRHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offer a $100 bundle that includes a free Ring Smart Bulb&lt;/a&gt;, though, and Target is currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal/-/A-80770246/&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22362455%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $80 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $120. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3g4zTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccs5nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 38,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2-megapixel camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The second-gen model is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08KJN3333/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740550908332818656" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $85, however, you can also pick up the last-gen model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa-charcoal%2F-%2FA-76526131%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000012807845%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Local%257CElectronics_Ecomm_Hardlines%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9061079%26targetid%3Dpla-990594042919%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwo4mIBhBsEiwAKgzXOLrJxn1_3VD1UR7wtcFcAcvw397zeAm5Hp9bimjK6d6Phv9g3whA2xoCMfYQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747625078603978178#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $45, its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently only available for $110 — its full retail price — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08J8FFJ8H_toAsin_B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742759409782754841#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fthis-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1082904/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen/-/A-83387876&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/this-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $130. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle that contains a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blink Mini for $140&lt;/a&gt; or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you want to buy this product, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGQIus"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329393970906605#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; also have a bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini security camera for $260. Target also has the discounted bundle, however, you’ll need to add the Blink Camera to your cart separately for the promotion to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon’s new hotspot plans are built for your #vanlife dreams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4TuZei39F0XAwRboLP5ZsDXM78=/98x0:1133x690/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653612/mobile_hotspot_1230x690.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon’s hotspot plans offer mobile data that can be shared with other devices in your luxury camper van, er, house.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H6FUdT"&gt;Verizon has introduced &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/plans/devices/hotspots/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new mobile hotspot plans&lt;/a&gt;, with four options to choose from starting at 15GB for $20 per month up to 150GB for $80 per month. They offer standalone and unlimited plan add-on mobile hotspot data that’s ready to be taken on the road. Maybe in a Class B Winnebago Solis with a pop-up sleeping compartment, as featured on &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, south through the redwoods and along the coast and then on through the painted deserts of the Southwest. What? I said that out loud? I mean, hypothetically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRuuTj"&gt;Anyway, the most basic plan, Essential, offers low-band Nationwide 5G and 4G LTE connectivity. The three more expensive plans — creatively named Plus, Pro, and Premium — include Ultra Wideband 5G, which encompasses the very fast, limited-range mmWave flavor of 5G as well as upcoming mid-band spectrum that should deliver broad coverage and fast performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h6QtC8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some of us (me) pay for unlimited data on Verizon that inexplicably can’t be used via mobile hotspot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B1c2Yg"&gt;The plans promise certain monthly premium data allotments; if they’re exceeded, data will be slower for the remainder of the month. Essential and Plus are available to Verizon customers, while Pro and Premium can be either added to an unlimited plan or purchased as standalone products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jk11h"&gt;This is all well and good, but while we’re on the subject of unlimited plans, let’s not forget that some of us (me) pay for unlimited data on Verizon that inexplicably can’t be used via mobile hotspot. Let’s say (hypothetically) you’re sitting around your freezing cold house in March during a power outage waiting for the heat and the Wi-Fi to come back on and you think you’d like to get a little work done by switching on your phone’s mobile hotspot feature. Nope! Because you picked the cheapest unlimited plan, you’re stuck working on offline Google Docs until the power comes back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkKL9r"&gt;Well, now I (hypothetically) have a couple of options: pay up for a premium unlimited plan (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;exactly what The Man wants us to do&lt;/a&gt;), or buy a mobile hotspot, load that baby up with Premium Unlimited hotspot data and take off on a dreamy #vanlife tour of the Pacific Coast in an imaginary Winnebago Solis. The white one, not the red one. Let’s not get carried away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie reveals how Destiny 2 crossplay will and won’t work, and a rough idea when</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKNqZq5oRHkcXDVKfS0fer1-EUQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653589/overview_screenshot_3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ROsCMb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; developer Bungie revealed a whole lot of information about the game’s upcoming crossplay support &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50506"&gt;in a blog post on Thursday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s get this out of the way first: Bungie still doesn’t have an exact date for &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you’ll be able to play with your friends on other platforms, but the studio promises the feature will launch “early” in Season 15, &lt;a href="https://www.vg247.com/2021/07/07/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-reveal-date/"&gt;which is expected to kick off on August 24th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqvsDJ"&gt;Season 15 will also bring an important change to ensure you have a persistent identity across platforms for crossplay: a new Bungie Name system. Your Bungie Name will be generated based on the name associated with the platform you play Season 15 on first, and will look something like PlayerName#1234. You can get a better idea of how it will look in-game in this screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glmAS43zR87lB394dloBJ_J0lBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749536/Full_Roster_Send_Invite.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A preview of Bungie Names in &lt;/em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="40WVyd"&gt;Bungie won’t have a name change feature available at the launch of crossplay — that’s not expected until the winter. So make sure you first play Season 15 on the platform with the name you want associated with your Bungie Name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH8gGz"&gt;The studio will run names through a moderation process to help prevent offensive terms from slipping through and says that characters in names that “we are unable to display in the game or that can’t be typed into the player search box via console virtual keyboards” will be stripped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jVwLj"&gt;Bungie also discussed how players across different platforms will be matched up at the launch of crossplay. For PvE modes, “there will be one global matchmaking pool,” Bungie says, but for competitive modes (Crucible, Iron Banner, Trials, and Gambit), matchmaking will break down like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QKuvhu"&gt;PC players will match with PC players&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sFLFfj"&gt;Console players will match with console players — and, notably, Stadia players, who can use mouse and keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Aj6ZGu"&gt;Fireteams with any mix of PC and console players will be matched with other PC players&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EeYEXB"&gt;This approach at launch may change at some point, however — Bungie says that it “might not be the answer forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLzWIE"&gt;One missing feature at launch will be voice chat between platforms, Bungie said. “We have run into some late-breaking issues with development and are currently working on making sure this experience is ready before shipping it live,” according to Bungie. The company considered delaying crossplay to make sure the feature was included, but has opted instead to launch without it and add it in an update “targeted for shortly after Cross Play goes live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXCAl2"&gt;Bungie details a lot more about crossplay in its latest blog, and if you’re interested in learning more, I suggest taking a few minutes &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50506"&gt;to read the whole thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hipch"&gt;Bungie confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163382/bungie-destiny-2-crossplay-next-year-2021-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; would be getting crossplay in 2021. But in May, some players got to try it out early when the studio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22431683/destiny-2-crossplay-released-accidentally-stadia-pc"&gt;accidentally turned the feature on&lt;/a&gt; for some players — a loophole the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cozmo23/status/1392286577187905540"&gt;eventually closed&lt;/a&gt;. There was also &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/5/25/22451506/destiny-2-cross-play-test-beta-strike-playlist-emblem-dates"&gt;an official crossplay beta later that month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is crashing for a lot of people again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4vDsFgmcdf2y6B-WUyYEFFhQ6IY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653487/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UHY1JL"&gt;Snapchat is experiencing a massive issue as of Thursday evening, with more than 125,000 users &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/snapchat/"&gt;reporting problems on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;. I tried logging into the app on my iPhone 12 Mini, and now the app just crashes every time I try and open the app. Two other &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers aren’t able to open the app, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXLvwv"&gt;Snap acknowledged that there’s a problem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1420879693373267975"&gt;in a tweet at 6:51PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re aware of an issue preventing some Snapchatters from logging in,” the company said from Snapchat’s support account. “Hang tight, we are looking into it and working on a fix!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkuwa4"&gt;The outage follows a nasty bug from June where a version of the iOS Snapchat app would crash at launch. That bug was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554376/snapchat-ios-latest-update-crash-launch-not-working"&gt;eventually fixed&lt;/a&gt; in an update released soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQxjJP"&gt;As always, I highly recommend following the memes people are posting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=snapchat%20down&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — they should provide a fun distraction until Snapchat is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forza Motorsport 7 will be driving into the sunset in September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IjQkB-ygYWKtgtmZKUYBVAmDGcM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653447/Forza7_E3_PressKit_03_OtherSideOfTheStorm_WM_4K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Turn 10 Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dS4U2N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport 7 &lt;/em&gt;will no longer be available to purchase from the Microsoft Store or play on Xbox Game Pass after September 15th, 2021, as &lt;a href="https://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/news/forza-motorsport-7-end-of-life"&gt;it’s reaching “end of life” status&lt;/a&gt;. The game won’t be completely going away — if you own it you’ll still be able to download and play it, and the multiplayer will still be accessible, but anyone without the game won’t be able to buy the digital version. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1420792916742590464?s=20"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Forza &lt;/em&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, this is happening because the game’s licenses to use real-world cars and tracks are starting to expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mf6YO"&gt;If you’re a long-time &lt;em&gt;Forza &lt;/em&gt;fan, you may have seen this happen before. Games in the series have historically &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/by-september-xbox-wont-have-a-single-forza-motorsport-game-for-sale/"&gt;been delisted around four years after their release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Horizon 3 &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360052097274-End-of-Life-for-Forza-Horizon-3"&gt;delisted in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; after being launched in September 2016, and &lt;em&gt;Motorsport 6&lt;/em&gt; was removed from Microsoft’s online store &lt;a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-6-to-be-delisted-next-month/"&gt;in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;, following its launch in September 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ROwJqO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s Game Pass adds some complication to &lt;em&gt;Motorsport 7&lt;/em&gt;’s delisting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vFKFuP"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Motorsport 7&lt;/em&gt;, there’s the complication of Xbox Game Pass. The game will no longer be available on the service after September 15th, which leads to an interesting question: what about the people who didn’t buy the game, but bought DLC for it to play with the Game Pass version? &lt;a href="https://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/news/forza-motorsport-7-end-of-life"&gt;Forza says&lt;/a&gt; that anyone in this situation will receive a “token” that will let them keep playing the game. The token will be sent to players by August 2nd, and will have to be redeemed before September 15th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lQE1N2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not dumb at all! Forza games have to go unlisted after several years because the third party licenses that we use to feature real-world cars, tracks and other elements will begin to expire.&lt;/p&gt;— Forza Motorsport (@ForzaMotorsport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1420792916742590464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8qx5l"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1420792916742590464?s=20"&gt;the Forza twitter account&lt;/a&gt; tweeted that the games are being delisted because of licenses expiring, fans were quick to point out that some other racing games don’t seem to have this issue. For example, &lt;em&gt;Need For Speed Rivals&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://guides.gamepressure.com/nfsrivals/guide.asp?ID=23145"&gt;which features real cars&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was launched in 2013 and is currently &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fneed-for-speed-rivals%2Fc3vm0tmwnz5m" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reached out to EA to get an idea about how it licenses cars for the games, but didn’t immediately receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mo87Ol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It becomes difficult to check out older Forza titles, even if they’re well worth playing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvjWBm"&gt;The Forza model does seem curious: the games clearly have a lot of work put into them, and they’re often held up as a standard for how good racing games can look. Then, after about four years, they become much harder to buy. One of my colleagues mourned the loss of the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Horizon 3&lt;/em&gt;, which he considers to be the best game in the series. I’ve never played it, and would love to know what makes it so good — but I can’t get the game (used physical copies are available, but seemingly not for PC, and I don’t own an Xbox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZ9Rwy"&gt;This isn’t necessarily to point fingers at or shame the Forza team. As &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22559909/ncaa-college-football-nil-rules-pay-players-ea-sports-video-game"&gt;EA Sports and the NCAA have shown&lt;/a&gt;, digitizing the real world into a playable form can be messy when there’s people or brands involved. What’s more, the makers of hyper and super-cars, like the ones featured in Forza, can be especially protective of their brand. Famously, Ferrari reportedly sent musician Deadmau5 &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/ferrari-sent-deadmau5-a-cease-and-desist-about-his-purr-1627640534"&gt;a cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt; for customizing his car. It’s just odd that, for whatever reason, this is how Forza does the licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldC9YM"&gt;While it may be unfortunate that &lt;em&gt;Forza Motorsport 7&lt;/em&gt; is being taken off Microsoft’s virtual shelves, there is a silver lining: if you want to get it before it’s gone, the game’s Standard, Deluxe, and Ultimate editions &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Fp%2Fforza-motorsport-7-standard-edition%2F9n3nk5ww05ht" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are all 75 percent off&lt;/a&gt;, selling for $9.99, $14.99, and $19.99 respectively. &lt;a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4404442728339-End-of-Life-for-Forza-Motorsport-7-"&gt;According to Forza’s support article&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll be on sale until September 15th, and the game will still be playable after it’s no longer available to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood’s public trading is off to a rocky start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWt4uu8mLYStsMtDv-_xnYS9DsE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653064/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LYeasp"&gt;Robinhood started trading at $38, dropped about 10 percent, recovered, but still closed down 8 percent at $34.90 on its first day of trading. It’s the worst first day among 51 firms that raised as much as Robinhood or more, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/robinhood-flirts-with-worst-debut-ever-for-ipo-of-its-size"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also bad news for Robinhood’s experiment at offering retail investors a chunk of the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtpJZH"&gt;Robinhood’s shares priced at the bottom of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-prices-at-38-a-share-11627515866"&gt;the targeted price range of $38 to $42 a share&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps because of concerns about volatility or perhaps because Robinhood wanted to ensure a pop for its retail investors. And though Robinhood had said it would allocate up to 35 percent of its shares to retail, only 20 percent actually went to retail, which “indicated less interest than expected,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/robinhood-stock.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Iapm2f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood is synonymous with the rise of meme stocks and retail investing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9qnPZ6"&gt;Because the stock traded down, institutional investors — those who traditionally buy IPOs and who bought the majority of this one — may be leery of future IPOs if there are a lot of retail investors involved, according to Robert Le, an analyst for Pitchbook. That may mean bankers and other companies will avoid giving retail investors as much access to future IPOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcZq7X"&gt;A bad first day of trading may not mean much for Robinhood in the long run. I mean, Facebook had a disastrous IPO in 2012 — pricing at $38, doing not much of anything its first day, and then falling during the following trading days. Facebook’s current share price, by the way, is $358.32. It is arguably successful! So I don’t know what today means for Robinhood the company. Besides, Robinhood sold shares to its customers — and they may be very loyal investors if they like the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqjZLz"&gt;Now, it may be that retail investors aren’t trying to maximize their returns, &lt;a href="https://business.vanderbilt.edu/bio/josh-white/"&gt;says Josh White&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University, who was previously a financial economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission. They might just be doing some &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-02/robinhood-ipo-filing-is-a-lesson-in-meme-finance"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt;. “Investors are trying to maximize their happiness, not their wealth,” White says. “A lot of people get utility — fun or joy — out of trading stock.” Maybe, he suggests, this is better than going to a casino or gambling on DraftKings because companies can use the money to invest in jobs and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRK6nG"&gt;Robinhood is synonymous with the rise of meme stocks and retail investing. In fact, in a complaint &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-141.pdf"&gt;the SEC filed today&lt;/a&gt; against Nikola founder Trevor Milton, it says that Milton “embarked on a relentless public relations blitz aimed at a class of investors he called ‘Robinhood investors.” The complaint goes on to say that Milton tracked the number of new Robinhood investors who got into Nikola’s stock as a sign of success. Milton is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;being charged with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt;; Nikola, which peaked in price above $65 last year, is now worth $12.26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHlvV8"&gt;If those retail investors lose a lot of money, that may be trouble for brokers — not just Robinhood. “Eventually, these are going to be customers that all brokerage firms want to attract,” White says. “If they lose a lot of money now, are they going to exit investing altogether?” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 beta update also fixes one of its silliest flaws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ek7dTTLJ8EjzoGCErZUamTyb6to=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653009/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Reqltx"&gt;The first major system update for Sony’s PlayStation 5 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;arriving in beta form today&lt;/a&gt;, finally letting you expand the console’s 667GB of usable storage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;by adding your own PCIe Gen 4 SSD&lt;/a&gt; as well as testing new UI options and expanding 3D Audio support. But the full changelog also includes a few features that Sony didn’t highlight to press — including a way to easily update your DualSense controller if you press the wrong button!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej2eJy"&gt;You see, the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22539827/ps5-playstation-controller-how-to-update-dualsense"&gt;currently has a very silly flaw&lt;/a&gt;: the only time you can update your controller is when you boot the console. And if you say no or accidentally press the O button instead of X, you can’t trigger that update until 24 hours have passed (or you tweak your PS5’s internal clock to cheat it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuTZKY"&gt;But in Beta 2.0, there’s now a dedicated menu for that under &lt;strong&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Accessories &amp;gt; Controllers &lt;/strong&gt;called &lt;strong&gt;Wireless Controller Device Software. &lt;/strong&gt;Please forgive my grainy photo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JpEzWmf0VrVFYyYU8nBAvbY1Mj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749298/IMG_1280.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uoYI6x"&gt;You’ll still see controller update prompts when you launch the console, too — and hitting the circle button will still instantly dismiss them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oAvlI"&gt;The beta also makes one of our other UI frustrations slightly better: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/21591497/sony-playstation-5-ps5-turn-off-difficult-menu-ui-confusing-design"&gt;the ability to easily turn off the console&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still a mystery why Sony switched away from letting you long-press the PS button to requiring extra taps, but at least now you can change how many taps it takes. Pressing the hamburger / start button in the PS5’s quick actions menu now lets you drag any of them (including the PS5’s digital power button) to a different position in that menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TBHEw"&gt;Separately, did you know the PS5 lets you set up all kinds of parental controls for your kid on what they can play, watch, and do, and it lets you remotely approve their requests over the web? I didn’t realize that, and the beta update now lets you see and respond to those asks through the latest version of the mobile PlayStation App, not just via email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EUb04bhTpwAOVKxj6arU81WxYw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749344/IMG_1284.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gBIavSeOCdV60N_MpG7hdSLqU_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749355/PXL_20210729_195331602.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Phh51A"&gt;Frankly, it still needs work: it’s a convoluted process that kicks you out to a web browser for setup, requires your kid to be signed into a PlayStation Network account (not just a local profile), has you set up all kinds of limits, and kicks you out to a web browser &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; (requiring you to log in) when you want to approve a request. And once you let your kid play a particular game, they get to keep playing until you remove it from the whitelist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zsj0hp"&gt;What I want is a simple rich phone notification that effectively lets me tap “yes, you can play this for 30 minutes” or “not right now, kid” and be done with it right away. Perhaps there’s time before the 2.0 software goes gold? Or perhaps in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZxc6O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OwP6V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon gives Alexa a new iOS widget and the ability to assign reminders </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qah7ziH0OcDsOww6Ov7J6mGxB4=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69653005/dseifert_201025_4263_00010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOnxCe"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=23564416011"&gt;has updated the Alexa app on iOS&lt;/a&gt; so that you can access the voice assistant right from your home screen via a new widget. Everyone can use the assistant to remind specific members of your household to do tasks through a new “assign reminders” skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxukMk"&gt;Due to the somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21574112/google-new-gmail-widget-ios-14-limitations"&gt;restrictive nature of the widgets on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, the new Ask Alexa widget isn’t so much Alexa itself as it is a link directly to the iOS app. But if you have the Alexa widget placed on any of your screens and you’ve already given the Alexa app permission to use your iPhone’s mic, you’ll be able to start making requests with a tap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRfihEo33Uu2B-L45YtQP7ZL8ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749259/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA_gAAAfQCAYAAABRxXU3AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAJ8WlUWHRYTUw6Y29tLmFkb2Jl.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ask Alexa widget in iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ovSwOc"&gt;And now those requests can get a bit more granular. Amazon’s given Alexa the ability to assign reminders to specific members of your household if they have a Voice Profile set up on the same Amazon Alexa account. So if you say “Alexa, remind Jeff to take the lasagna out of the freezer at 10AM,” Alexa will be able to deliver the reminder to the right person, at the right time, through the Alexa app. You can add profiles to your Alexa account in Settings under Your Profile, and Amazon says you can assign relationship nicknames to each one, like mom, dad, daughter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn4r96"&gt;Alexa picks up new features and skills on a monthly basis, but Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;also announced plans in June&lt;/a&gt; to open up Alexa even further to third-party developers. Among many new APIs, developers will be able to create custom widgets for the Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x0kID9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon will let devs compete for your Echo Show’s screen and everything else Alexa just added ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s earnings show why Andy Jassy is now in charge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The 2019 CERAWeek Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6pUX2RhhIVWAVo8DBZuXE6-mytQ=/0x0:4533x3022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69652832/1129882599.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LuJ0Ze"&gt;As stores reopen and in-person shopping picks back up, the surge in demand for Amazon purchases has finally started to wane — not &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, to be clear, but just enough to frustrate investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1T479j"&gt;From April through June, Amazon saw $113.1 billion in sales of products and services, growing 27 percent year over year. That’s an enormous amount of money, but investors were hoping for a bit more, around $115 billion, and Amazon’s stock has been slipping since releasing the figures in &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results-2dcdc6a32/default.aspx"&gt;its Q2 2021 earnings report&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="szUb6c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AWS is picking up speed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cSFrk1"&gt;But there was one spot investors are happy to see, and it helps to explain the company’s recent executive shuffle. Amazon Web Services did $14.8 billion in net sales, up 37 percent year over year. That substantial growth outpaced Amazon as a whole and AWS’s prior Q2, when it grew by 29 percent. It was the sole business bright spot that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Andy Jassy, Amazon’s new CEO&lt;/a&gt;, found worthy of mentioning in his remarks accompanying the release, saying “we’ve seen AWS growth reaccelerate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JJDZA"&gt;Jassy had been in charge of AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;up until July 5th&lt;/a&gt;, when he was elevated to CEO to replace Jeff Bezos, who left to go &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRje0TBHGPS/"&gt;eat Skittles in space&lt;/a&gt;. The cloud division has always been a powerhouse for Amazon, accounting for most of the company’s operating income. While its growth had slowed during the pandemic, the division now seems to be, as Jassy said, reaccelerating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ny2Ktu"&gt;As for the rest of Amazon, the concern from investors over a company that merely made $113.1 billion in a three-month span may stem from two places. For one, last year Amazon was growing way faster — it saw 40 percent growth in net sales this time in 2020, versus 27 percent this year — though one might recall that a certain global pandemic was picking up during those months, encouraging a boom in online shopping. But secondly, the other tech giants have done quite well this quarter, beating investor expectations, making Amazon the odd one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N97EQW"&gt;Prime Day was also held in June this year, which likely helped juice those numbers. Amazon said 250 million items were purchased, more than any prior Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yH1Cm"&gt;“As the quarter progressed, people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of our largest geographies, including the US and much of Europe,” Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with investors. As a result, he said, spending by Prime members “moderated compared to the peak of the pandemic.” There was a drop in categories like cleaning supplies and computer monitors, which people bought more of this time last year, but don’t need in the same numbers again this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmx5Og"&gt;There have been signs that the growth of online shopping as a whole is starting to slow down. Growth is still growth, but it means that Amazon and its investors can’t expect to see gains quite as enormous as the ones that happened in 2020, as much of the world tried to avoid indoor shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzwuKB"&gt;Olsavsky said Jassy has “hit the ground running” but didn’t offer any guidance on whether he would be bringing immediate changes to the company. “Expect Andy and his unique brand of positive attitude and optimism,” he said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UMkuU"&gt;Jassy hasn’t offered any indication of how he’ll steer the company differently from Bezos either, but today’s numbers help to show why he’s in charge. AWS remains a bright spot, and its leader now has the rest of Amazon to look after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkFsc3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 29th, 6:42PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with remarks from Amazon’s earnings call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
