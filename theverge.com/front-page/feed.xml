    <title>CPSC urges people with children at home to stop using Peloton Tread Plus treadmill ‘immediately’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qHhQF"&gt;The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Saturday &lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread+"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about Peloton Tread Plus treadmills, saying the machines pose “serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.” In a March blog post by CEO John Foley, the company &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;said it was aware&lt;/a&gt; that a child had died in an accident on the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9yzbK"&gt;The agency says it is aware of 39 incidents with the Tread Plus, including one death. “In light of multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under the rear roller of the product, CPSC urges consumers with children at home to stop using the product immediately,” the CPSC bulletin states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLvtZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y&amp;amp;ab_channel=U.S.ConsumerProductSafetyCommission"&gt;The CPSC posted a video&lt;/a&gt; showing what could happen in a Tread Plus accident involving a child. It shows an unattended child being pulled under the treadmill and nearly crushed before he is able to escape (we’re linking to but not embedding the video because it’s disturbing to watch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFKtHQ"&gt;The agency issued a list of recommendations for users of the Tread Plus: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FjvQFG"&gt;Stop using the Peloton Tread Plus if there are small children or pets at home. Incidents suggest that children may be seriously injured while the Tread Plus is being used by an adult, not just when a child has unsupervised access to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPw7kq"&gt;If consumers must continue to use the product, CPSC urges consumers to use the product only in a locked room, to prevent access to children and pets while the treadmill is in use. Keep all objects, including exercise balls and other equipment, away from the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsxXYL"&gt;When not in use, unplug the Tread Plus and store the safety key away from the device and out of reach of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VL63Sd"&gt;Separate from the incident where the child died, the &lt;a href="https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch/Detail?ReportId=3054628"&gt;CPSC received a report&lt;/a&gt; In February that a three-year-old boy suffered a ”significant brain injury” in an incident with a Tread Plus treadmill. According to that report, the child had tread marks on his back matching the slats of the treadmill, as well as neck and other injuries. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;Peloton commented on the report&lt;/a&gt; at the time, saying the child from that incident “is expected to fully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJtk38"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;Peloton said in a statement Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it refuted what it called a “misleading, inaccurate bulletin” by the CPSC. According to Peloton, the company had sought to make a joint announcement with the CPSC about “the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided” with the Tread Plus. The agency has, according to the company “unfairly characterized Peloton’s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC’s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqupFa"&gt;The company told the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it did not believe a recall of the Tread Plus was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>During Indianapolis shooting, FedEx cell phone policy meant some family members couldn’t reach workers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CJzRMV"&gt;During a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis on Thursday, a company policy barring some employees from having their cell phones on them while working prevented family members from being able to contact workers inside the facility, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/shooting-fedex.html?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxyT7b"&gt;Authorities said the gunman, a former employee, fired into the warehouse killing eight people and wounding at least seven others, then fatally shot himself before police arrived. The incident began around 11PM Thursday and was over in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVaTcf"&gt;Tami Campbell, whose husband works at the facility, said she didn’t know what had happened to him until he called her after his shift ended at 10AM Friday. “I called his phone a thousand times even though I knew he wouldn’t have it,” she told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. And according to the &lt;em&gt;Indianapolis Star&lt;/em&gt;, many family members had &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2021/04/16/fedex-shooting-families-wait-employees-indianapolis/7250160002/"&gt;to wait overnight at a Holiday Inn Express&lt;/a&gt; to find out if their family members had been hurt or killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMkwq0"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, a FedEx spokesperson described the cell phone policy: “To support safety protocols and minimize potential distractions around package sortation equipment and dock operations, cell phone access within certain areas of FedEx Ground field operations is limited to authorized team members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BeMI4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter having a partial outage Saturday morning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4kJplUrnXfZcq1dnySFKdV5B-A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142133/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tAkjEl"&gt;It looks like problems on Twitter that began Friday night are persisting Saturday morning. People on the east coast of the US were reporting that while the page would load, they were unable to send tweets and DMs. As of 11 AM ET Saturday, the site was still experiencing issues for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rG6yl0"&gt;There’s no official word on how widespread the outage is, but Twitter said Saturday it was “fixing an issue” with its servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ylVPU"&gt;Twitter Support posted a brief message Friday night that it was looking into the matter, and updated it Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BV6AwV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know that parts of Twitter still aren’t working for some of you. We’re fixing an issue with our servers to get things back to normal soon. Thanks for sticking with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1383436102577442835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLAd58"&gt;There’s no official word on how widespread the outage is. Downdetector, which monitors site outages, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/"&gt;showed a massive spike in problems&lt;/a&gt; around 8:25PM ET on Friday. Things seemed to be returning to normal within an hour, but Saturday morning around 8AM ET, it was showing a small uptick in reported problems again. Often these outages are the result of a problem with an intermediary service like Amazon Web Services, but its &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;dashboard shows all green&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVsQcZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.twitterstat.us/"&gt;Twitter’s API status&lt;/a&gt; website posted a message that its data team was investigating “a possible system irregularity currently affecting all Twitter API v2 endpoints starting at 2021-04-17 12:00 UTC. The presence and scope of any developer impact has not been determined at this time, but we will provide an update as soon as we know more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGxyU0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 17th 11:23AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds more information about the outage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is fighting a recall request on its treadmill after a child died last month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1AV52L"&gt;Peloton is resisting a request from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to recall its Tread Plus treadmill, which was &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;involved with the death of a child last month&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting tonight&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the incident, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Finvesting%2Fus-consumer-agency-to-investigate-peloton-treadmill-death&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22388707%2Fpeloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CPSC issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it was investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjp6m"&gt;The agency is reportedly planning on issuing a consumer alert about the Tread Plus and may do so as early as Saturday, according to officials who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post. &lt;/em&gt;One official added that “this doesn’t happen with other treadmills.” The &lt;em&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; sources tell the paper that the CPSC is aware of “‘dozens’ of incidents involving Peloton’s treadmills, some involving pets or exercise balls and many of them resulting in serious injuries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eLrE6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/peloton-ceo-says-accident-with-treadmill-led-to-death-of-child?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; this this past February the &lt;a href="https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch/Detail?ReportId=3054628"&gt;CPSC received a report&lt;/a&gt; that a three-year-old suffered a ”significant brain injury. He was found to have tread marks on his back matching the slats of the treadmill, neck injury, and petechiae on his face, presumably from occlusion of blood flow.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;Peloton commented on the report&lt;/a&gt; that the child from that separate incident “is expected to fully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96Et8p"&gt;Peloton CEO John Foley &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;noted the death in an open letter&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th, in which he reiterated the safety instructions for Peloton’s Tread Plus exercise treadmill, including “Keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJcqd6"&gt;“While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt,” Foley wrote, “each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfDmdj"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Peloton spokesperson writes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3WiKKJ"&gt;We are disappointed that the CPSC is mischaracterizing the situation. The Peloton Tread+ is safe for use at home when operated as directed and in accordance with our warnings and safety instructions. As a reminder, the Tread+ is not for children under 16 and children, pets, and objects need to be kept away from the Tread+ at all times. Peloton is 100% committed to the safety of our Members and we will always be open to working with the CPSC to implement impactful safety measures. When the Tread+ is not in use, Members should continue to follow the safety instructions by storing the safety key, which keeps the Tread+ from operating, away from the Tread+ and out of reach of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xFbIVy"&gt;A spokesperson for the company told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; that it “does not believe a recall is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNV7Ee"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;Peloton said in a news release Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it didn’t provide more information to the CPSC at the family’s request —”until it was compelled by subpoena to do so.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GiqrH"&gt;According to Peloton, the company “invited the CPSC to make a joint announcement about the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided” with the Tread Plus, and CEO Foley asked to meet directly with the CPSC. The agency has, according to the company “unfairly characterized Peloton’s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC’s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth.” The CPSC, Peloton claims, was “unwilling to engage in any meaningful discussions with Peloton before issuing its inaccurate and misleading press release.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSNKYU"&gt;At issue is whether the accident was a result of a poorly designed product or improper use — Peloton says that not only should children be kept away from the treadmill, but that owners should “store it out of reach of children” when it’s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pW1w42"&gt;In October of 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2020/peloton-recalls-pr70p-bike-pedals-due-to-laceration-hazard-recall-alert"&gt;Peloton recalled&lt;/a&gt; the PR70P Clip-In Pedals, because they “can break unexpectedly during use, causing laceration injuries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKDTLb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 17th, 10:43AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds new statement from Peloton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge in Australia finds Google misled Android users about location data collection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNd4ChOTFBb4tPlYnL2n_1bWB6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142463/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2t5kR"&gt;A judge in Australia found Google misled users about personal location data the company collected via Android devices,  a violation of Australian law, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-canberra-court-decisions-courts-laws-c6a7b75ac7cbfabc6ff2bc4069e3911c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MLDP9"&gt;According to Federal Court Judge Thomas Thawley, the violations occurred between January 2017 and December 2018. Users creating a new Google account while setting up a new Android device were led to believe that the “Location History” setting was the only Google account setting that would determine if the company collected identifiable data about the user’s location. In fact, another Google account setting that was turned on by default — the “Web &amp;amp; App Activity” setting— allowed Google to collect and store personally identifiable location information when it was active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3esSHA"&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the company’s consumer watchdog organization, said it is seeking penalties against Google, but did not specify an amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgReMx"&gt;“This is an important victory for consumers, especially anyone concerned about their privacy online, as the Court’s decision sends a strong message to Google and others that big businesses must not mislead their customers,” &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/google-misled-consumers-about-the-collection-and-use-of-location-data"&gt;ACCC chair Rod Sims said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoBLcb"&gt;Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. But a spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; that the company disagreed with the judge’s findings and was considering an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcvnVp"&gt;The company has been involved in legal action in Australia over the past several months. In February, the Australian government passed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;a law requiring Google&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook to pay media companies for news content distributed on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qumkuq"&gt;Developers will still have 90 days to fix bugs, but Project Zero will wait another 30 days before it discloses the details of the bug publicly. If a flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, a company will have seven days to issue a patch, and a three-day grace period if requested. But Google Project Zero will wait 30 days before it discloses technical details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3m88I"&gt;In 2020, Google announced a trial to allow developers 90 days to work on patch development and adoption, with the idea that if a dev wanted more time to allow users to install a patch, they’d ship the fixes early in the 90-day period. “In practice however, we &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; observe a significant shift in patch development timelines, and we continued to receive feedback from vendors that they were concerned about publicly releasing technical details about vulnerabilities and exploits before most users had installed the patch,” Project Zero’s Tim Willis wrote in the blog post. “In other words, the implied timeline for patch adoption wasn’t clearly understood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRaC05"&gt;The goal of the 2021 update, Willis wrote, is to make the patch adoption timeline an explicit part of its vulnerability disclosure policy. “This 90+30 policy gives vendors more time than our current policy, as jumping straight to a 60+30 policy (or similar) would likely be too abrupt and disruptive,” he wrote. “Our preference is to choose a starting point that can be consistently met by most vendors, and then gradually lower both patch development and patch adoption timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Washington state lawmakers vote to phase out gasoline cars by 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Traffic Jam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYgvohHa7yyBd88F_EHpQH4WAWg=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142149/shutterstock_54135052.1419966774.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Traffic Jam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yojoZs"&gt;Washington state lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22450947/clean_cars_2030.pdf"&gt;passed a measure&lt;/a&gt; that would phase out the sale of gas-powered vehicles starting in 2030. The Clean Cars 2030 initiative passed Thursday as an amendment &lt;a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/1287-S2.E%20AMS%20ENGR%20S2584.E.pdf"&gt;to a bill&lt;/a&gt; that requires state utilities prepare for an electric-vehicle future. The bill now awaits Gov. Jay Inslee’s signature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G60dDl"&gt;That’s five years earlier than planned gas vehicle bans in California and Massachusetts, and the first ban on gas cars passed by legislators, rather than by an executive order. The bill passed Washington’s Senate by a vote of 25-23 and a vote of 54-43 in the House. The bill bans the sale, purchase, or registration of non-EVs from model year 2030 and later, and would include vehicles bought in another state and brought into Washington state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lafAK"&gt;The Clean Cars 2030 measure depends on the state approving a tax on vehicle miles traveled, which would help pay for new transportation infrastructure in the state, according to the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KT49H7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an order&lt;/a&gt; last September in that would ban the sale of new combustion-engine vehicles in the state starting in 2035, also part of a package of policy changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That measure applies to new-vehicle sales in the state, and doesn’t bar Californians from owning gas-powered vehicles. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker unveiled a plan in December to ban new gas-powered cars by 2035 as part of that state’s &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/ma-2050-decarbonization-roadmap/download"&gt;2050 Decarbonization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Camera footage from wolf’s collar reveals a very good boy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2ZobcYyv3l8vR2iQg2Zl740xjk=/136x0:1462x884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140802/Screen_Shot_2021_04_16_at_4.36.49_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XdBpoK"&gt;Have you ever wanted to watch a wolf hunt freshwater fish? Thanks to the Voyageurs Wolf Project from the University of Minnesota, you can see it on YouTube any time you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKdqn3"&gt;The researchers with the project trapped V089, a lone wolf, sedated him, and then strapped on the Vectronic-Aerospace camera collar. The collar recorded video in 30 second bursts during daylight hours, for a total of 7 minutes a day. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYgADito0E0jAoMe7RvXSQGiCJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22450235/Screen_Shot_2021_04_16_at_4.39.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The wolf is a regular neckbeard, it turns out&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SbK97l"&gt;The footage is &lt;em&gt;very cool&lt;/em&gt;, though some of it is obscured by V089’s fur. (“The wolf’s beard needed a little trim... lesson learned,” one video caption says.) They found that V089 was clever enough to hunt near a beaver dam, going after fish that were trapped by the obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMXB5B"&gt;“Up until recently, wolves hunting and killing freshwater fish is something that people didn’t even really know happened,” researcher &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/see-the-first-camera-collar-footage-from-a-wild-wolf-1846702152"&gt;Thomas Gable told &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Voyageurs Wolf Project documented wolves hunting freshwater fish in one pack a few years ago, but assumed that it was just a weird quirk. “The fact that this wolf started doing this is evidence that it’s not a one-off thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugYV1x"&gt;Other highlights of the footage include the wolf chewing on a deer bone, tromping through a river, and eating a fish. Who’s a good boy? V089! Who owns the copyright? Probably the Voyageurs Wolf Project, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17235486/monkey-selfie-lawsuit-ninth-circuit-motion-to-dismiss-denied"&gt;unless PETA gets involved&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Edward Snowden NFT sells for more than $5.4 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cory Doctorow and Edward Snowden" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJMHKiKso-YfZUkeRuLWUcSh-qU=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140678/live_2017_05_03_snowden_doctorow_6420.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Stacke / NYPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZyzIz"&gt;Today, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden’s NFT &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437"&gt;sold for about $5.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, or 2,224 ETH. The NFT is of an artwork that shows an image of Snowden’s face made from pages of a US appeals court decision that ruled the mass surveillance program Snowden exposed had violated US law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZQZ7V"&gt;The image is called “Stay Free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ovZqc"&gt;The profits won’t go to America’s most famous exiled whistleblower, however. Instead, the sale is meant to benefit the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where Snowden is the president. &lt;a href="https://freedom.press/about/board/"&gt;Its board&lt;/a&gt; includes actor John Cusack, whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, and the writer Glenn Greenwald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pw0Sqr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have a winner, internet friends. I want to extend a very special thanks to everyone who followed this over the last 24 hours, and the deepest gratitude from EVERYONE at our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FreedomofPress?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FreedomofPress&lt;/a&gt; to those who bid on our charity event. You help us make a better world. Stay free! &lt;a href="https://t.co/A5SJDs5Sjp"&gt;https://t.co/A5SJDs5Sjp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1383155552793026560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMgku4"&gt;“Emerging applications of cryptography can play an important role in supporting our rights,” Snowden said &lt;a href="https://freedom.press/news/whistleblower-edward-snowden-charity-nft-auction/"&gt;in a statement from the Freedom of the Press Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “This auction will drive the development of valuable and privacy-protecting uses of encryption, to safeguard press freedom and serve the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UklV2"&gt;Snowden, who currently lives in Moscow, copied top-secret information from the National Security Agency and gave it to Greenwald and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/17/6994115/laura-poitras-interview-encryption-snowden-citizenfour"&gt;documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. The articles based on Snowden’s information, published in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. In 2020, seven years after Snowden passed his documents to Greenwald and Poitras, the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUSKBN25T3CK"&gt;US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the mass surveillance of Americans’ telephone records was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peak Design’s new magnet-powered phone case system delayed until August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gWzo_cLVS7ceJ6Kgj014SpTMMeo=/0x92:2200x1559/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69140354/20201018_Sean_Hollister_Verge_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eoaV6S"&gt;Peak Design has &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/mobile-by-peak-design-phone-cases-mounts-chargers-magsafe/posts/3132766?ref=ksr_email_backer_project_update_registered_users"&gt;announced it is delaying shipment of products&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peak-design/mobile-by-peak-design-phone-cases-mounts-chargers-magsafe/posts/3132766?ref=ksr_email_backer_project_update_registered_users"&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt; for Mobile, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/19/21522620/peak-design-mobile-phone-case-bike-car-mount-tripod-hands-on-kickstarter"&gt;broad range of phone accessories&lt;/a&gt; designed to make it easy to mount your phone on everything from a motorcycle handlebar to a simple dock on your desk. It is meant to be compatible with iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones. Originally targeted for May, the company now expects to be able to begin shipping in August, though some products will also come later. To make up for it, Peak is offering either full refunds for cancellations or discounts on other Peak Design products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6i4Cra"&gt;Peak Design has used Kickstarter to launch everything from camera-focused backpacks to tripods and its original product, an innovative camera mounting clip. But this new project is on a different scale of ambition: it’s multiple products designed to work together in an interlocking system of mounts, wireless chargers, mini tripods, wallets, and cases. Key to the entire system is a combination of magnets and physical locking mechanisms which can differ from product to product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oP81W"&gt;The project apparently started about two years ago, which means that just before the company was running to launch in October of 2020 Apple announced the iPhone 12 — complete with the MagSafe system of cases, chargers, and wallets that connect with magnets. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Some prototypes in Peak Design’s mobile system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQq6znEkQQtz2ySBD1SF_SJs4vI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21971354/20201018_Sean_Hollister_Verge_27.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Some prototypes in Peak Design’s mobile system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jbatU0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkoykp"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe system and Peak Design’s magnet system are different, but the company made the call to try to make its system interoperable in some ways with MagSafe. That has meant testing its products across all the different variables it could think of, mixing and matching Peak Design’s big portfolio of products with Apple’s new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfwHer"&gt;That complexity is one of the reasons for the delay, the first in Peak Design’s long history marketing products on Kickstarter. The second is the obvious one: delays introduced from COVID-19. The designers have been unable to travel to the factory to test their designs or go into their local workshop to suss out problems directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELmLDU"&gt;The company expects its first wave to include the most basic products in its lineup, cases and some “core mounts/accessories,” with a second wave coming “later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8l4vYz"&gt;Peak Design will email Kickstarter backers discount codes for its products (20 percent off anything plus 50 percent off a future purchase in the Mobile product line). It also says people who wish to cancel their pledge can email info@peakdesign.com.&lt;/p&gt;
