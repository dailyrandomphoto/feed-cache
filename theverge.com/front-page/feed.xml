    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018. And while AT&amp;amp;T’s streaming channel HBO Max has performed relatively well since its somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;messy launch last May&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not quite as robust as older streamers like Netflix. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212963/new-discovery-plus-streaming-channel-roku-hbo-peacock"&gt;Discovery launched its own streaming platform&lt;/a&gt; Discovery Plus, which launched with shows spun off from its Discovery Channel catalog, including a new &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt; series and new series from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUuVmy"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia unit owns cable channels CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Discovery’s offerings include cable networks HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. But as more people migrate away from traditional cable TV and to streaming options, most media companies are trying to find new ways to reach audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODc2pC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s sources indicated a deal could be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon debuts free video-streaming service MiniTV in its India app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/daax4VVbei9pNl5bRSAQsR2MRj4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295132/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H06VAa"&gt;Amazon has launched an ad-supported, free video streaming service called MiniTV within the Amazon India app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a different offering than its separate Amazon Prime Video service, as MiniTV is contained within Amazon’s traditional shopping app, rather than its own standalone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0VhbT"&gt;Only available to users in India, MiniTV’s catalog includes mostly older content which its content partners made originally for YouTube and other platforms. The lineup includes beauty and fashion content, tech news, and cooking shows, and Amazon’s partners for the channel include Indian web content studios Pocket Aces and TVF, and  list of well-known Indian comedians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyz1dN"&gt;The company says it’s planning “new and exclusive videos” in the coming months, but didn’t provide a timetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AsACx"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes, the channel should serve as a competitor to Flipkart Video, the free streaming service launched in 2019 by Walmart-owned Flipkart, one of Amazon’s biggest rivals in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fu4oRr"&gt;Amazon is still marketing its Prime Video to consumers in India as it competes with Netflix, which has &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2002038/netflixs-big-plans-in-india-may-be-slowed-by-covid-and-censorship/"&gt;plans to launch&lt;/a&gt; more than three dozen new movies and shows in India this year. The free MiniTV will help Amazon test whether streaming content can drive sales on its shopping app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqiQVI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGKPHe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New leak ahead of Google I/O claims Android 12 may include changes for widgets and notifications </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdTvT_cLRm-gr8gouPHYteBvyqY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69294807/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClIYju"&gt;Just ahead of Google I/O, which gets underway on Tuesday, a new leak purporting to be a preview of what’s coming during the annual developers’ conference gives some insight into what Android 12 might look like. A new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH"&gt;video from Jon Prosser&lt;/a&gt; shows what appear to be slides from a presentation of Android 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzHcVl"&gt;The first slide sets up what to expect: “A beautiful new experience,” “Stronger privacy and security protections,” and “All of your devices work better together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKLg96"&gt;The usual caveats about leaked materials apply, of course; there’s no guarantee this is what the final interface will look like, or how much may be announced during I/O. But the most interesting slide in Prosser’s video shows what appears to be a new user interface for Android 12, including a new media widget, a brightness toggle, a weather widget, an analog clock widget, a snooze/dismiss toggle, and stacked notifications (in the lower right corner of the screen grab):&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sD1Kno0uAE6ev-fPhH8zd-IBrdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22518083/prosser_slide_fpt_android_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH" target="_blank"&gt;Jon Prosser/Front Page Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A slide purporting to be part of a Google I/O presentation for new Android 12 features shows new UI elements.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gVbSuP"&gt;Previous leaks of Android 12 have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362543670050881543"&gt;shown stacked widgets&lt;/a&gt;, which look similar to the Smart Stacks introduced in iOS 14. We’ve also seen earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;leaks via XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt; that showed new themes and a conversation widget for Android 12. And Google’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395383/android-12-developer-preview-3-haptics-camera-sensors-beta-release-date-features"&gt;previews&lt;/a&gt; of Android 12 have included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289976/android-12-developer-preview-roundup-notifications-redesign-tweaks-emergency-sos"&gt;a lot of small tweaks&lt;/a&gt; and developer-focused features, while hinting at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291296/android-12-developer-preview-ui-changes-widget-stacks-lock-screen-notifications"&gt;some significant UI changes&lt;/a&gt; that have been rumored, including the stacked widgets and a new lock screen with larger clock text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yyVpS"&gt;Prosser shows a what he says is a video from I/O that shows updated notifications, a new keyboard design, and a new lock screen with a larger clock, which seem to confirm the earlier leaked info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VZnjm"&gt;If the details in the latest leak roundup are accurate, Android 12 could be the biggest overhaul of the OS in several years. We’ll find out more in a few days when the annual I/O conference kicks off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uV5fg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cloudflare says it’s time to end CAPTCHA ‘madness’, launches new security key-based replacement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_SHlkE8mjS_Vw3NWwyJtyiB7Fg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69294752/akrales_190220_3226_0034.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dIXSKy"&gt;Cloudflare, which you may know as a provider of DNS services or the company telling you why the website you clicked on won’t load, wants to replace the “madness” of CAPTCHAs across the web with an entirely new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAkTSp"&gt;CAPTCHAs are those tests you have to take, often when trying to log into a service, that ask you to click images of things like busses or crosswalks or bicycles to prove that you’re a human. (CAPTCHA, if you didn’t know, stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.”) The problem is, they add a lot of friction to using the web and can sometimes be difficult to solve — I’m sure I’m not the only person who has frustratingly failed a CAPTCHA because I didn’t see that corner of a crosswalk in one image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RPiWUF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JSTsix"&gt;In a blog, Cloudflare says it aims to “&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/"&gt;get rid of CAPTCHAs completely&lt;/a&gt;” by replacing them with a new way to prove you are a human by touching or looking at a device using a system it calls “Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood.” Right now, it only supports a limited number &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235288/two-factor-authentication-security-key-how-to"&gt;of USB security keys&lt;/a&gt; like YubiKeys, but you can test Cloudflare’s system for yourself right now &lt;a href="https://cloudflarechallenge.com/"&gt;on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzJqFf"&gt;I tried it out, and it worked great. All I had to do was click the prominent “I am human (beta)” button on the site, then follow a few prompts to select my security key, then tap it, and then allow the site to access the make and model of the key. When I did, the system waved me through (though it just took me back to the blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U295Fq"&gt;The whole process took all of a few seconds, and I have to admit that it was really nice not to puzzle over grainy images of busses and bus-looking objects. And in addition to the speed of it all, this new method could have a major accessibility benefit, as those with visual disabilities may not be able to complete CAPTCHAs in their current form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYS7nX"&gt;Here is the company’s “elevator pitch” of what’s going on behind the scenes to establish that you’re a human via its new method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y1EQMC"&gt;The short version is that your device has an embedded secure module containing a unique secret sealed by your manufacturer. The security module is capable of proving it owns such a secret without revealing it. Cloudflare asks you for proof and checks that your manufacturer is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qXZ2o9"&gt;You can read a much more extensive explanation on &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cryptographic-attestation-of-personhood/"&gt;the company’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jodkX4"&gt;While it’s all an intriguing idea, it may not be the end to CAPTCHAs as we know it just yet. For one thing, you probably won’t see the prompt in many places, as Cloudflare says this is only an experiment right now, available “on a limited basis in English-speaking regions.” And in its current state, it only works with a limited set of hardware: YubiKeys, HyperFIDO keys, and Thetis FIDO U2F keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7Q3w8"&gt;Cloudflare promises it will “look into adding other authenticators as soon as possible.” That could possibly expand to your phone: Cloudflare suggests the possibility of tapping a phone to their computer to pass a wireless signature using NFC. Google can now treat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066768/google-iphone-ios-security-key-2-factor-authentication"&gt;both iPhones&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18295348/google-android-phone-fido-webauthn-phishing-two-factor-authentication"&gt;and Android phones&lt;/a&gt; as physical security keys; If Google and Apple got on board with Cloudflare’s method, it could significantly reduce the barrier to entry to using it, since smartphones are much more common than security keys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fHCgsZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cloudflare’s system may actually be a worse solution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDc914"&gt;However, Cloudflare’s system may actually be a &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; solution, according to one critic. As Ackermann Yuriy (CEO of the consulting firm Webauthn Works) &lt;a href="https://herrjemand.medium.com/why-cloudflares-captcha-replacement-with-fido2-webauthn-is-a-really-bad-idea-d5487f6c7566"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, “attestation does not prove anything but the device model,” meaning that it doesn’t actually prove if someone using a device for authentication is, in fact, a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PC09Bm"&gt;Cloudflare essentially admits this itself in its own blog, saying that a drinking bird (those &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCKC-QVcVn0"&gt;bird toys that dip their beaks into water repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;) could press a touch sensor on a security key, thereby passing the authentication test. If the point of CAPTCHAs is to prevent bot farms from overrunning websites, we may need to consider whether bot farms equipped with with jury-rigged security key devices (or worse) will take advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRkLlj"&gt;Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/512900170967576576"&gt;isn’t always positively associated&lt;/a&gt; with CAPTCHAs; in a recent example, the company moved from Google’s reCAPTCHA to a service from hCaptcha &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/moving-from-recaptcha-to-hcaptcha/"&gt;in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and some people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katebevan/status/1250904759499882497"&gt;weren’t fans&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WUZbcg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lordy, if you thought clicking squares that show a traffic light was a pain, Google and Cloudflare have had a spat and the latter now has its own Captcha, which looks absolutely designed to put humans off bothering with sites that deploy it &lt;a href="https://t.co/odLTbZSAyZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/odLTbZSAyZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kate Bevan (@katebevan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katebevan/status/1250904759499882497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x62Hn7"&gt;CAPTCHAs also assume that website owners want to allow relatively anonymous traffic, but anonymous identity may be irrelevant if an website has your actual identity through login information you’ve provided. And with the recent push against ad targeting, driven in large part by Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;huge new privacy feature in iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt; that asks users if they want to let each app track them around the web, it’s possible that website providers will move more toward logins anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzYUb"&gt;Though it certainly sounds like a hassle to have to potentially deal with &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; logins (which is much easier to do with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;great password manager&lt;/a&gt;!), that shift could, counterintuitively, have the potential benefit of pushing us toward a passwordless future even sooner. If more services are pushing for direct logins, that could lead to more of them supporting security keys instead of a password. And more sites supporting security keys could put pressure on others to support them as well, like the trend we see toward two-factor authentication with phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBZBjm"&gt;While we’re not at that passwordless future just yet, Cloudflare’s potential replacement for the CAPTCHA could be a first step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this look at how Clubhouse’s blocking system is problematic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Clubhouse logo is seen on a smartphone screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vSBa-42nkkLrr3HsumM29jx2uG8=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292986/1232816107.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lRKsUn"&gt;Anyone who’s spent more than five minutes on social media can tell you that most platforms have plenty of trolls, reply-guys and other people who may just be unpleasant to interact with. On big platforms like Twitter, Faecbook, and Instagram, the option to block another user allows you to keep someone out of your feed. Blocking is far from a perfect solution, but at least it gives users a way to continue to use the platforms and avoid (some) nasty interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsBh1h"&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Will Oremus writes for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the year-old audio chat platform Clubhouse has a different mechanism for blocking, one that affects more than just the blocker and the blockee (I know, but what would you call it?): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ugrqj0"&gt;When you block someone on Clubhouse, it doesn’t just affect communications between the two of you, as it would on Facebook or Twitter. Rather, it limits the way that person can communicate with others too. Once blocked, they can’t join or even see any room that you create, or in which you are speaking—which effectively blocks them for everyone else in that room. If you’re brought “onstage” from the audience to speak, anyone else in the audience whom you have blocked will be kept off the stage for as long as you’re up there. And if you’re a moderator of a room, you can block a speaker and boot them from the conversation in real time—even if they’re mid-sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xLO8ce"&gt;So in essence, a “black badge” on Clubhouse can limit who speaks, where, and when on the platform. As Oremus notes, it’s a social act to block another person on Clubhouse, one that affects multiple interactions. And members of underrepresented groups said that blocking can be “weaponized” on Clubhouse, to squelch certain points of view or restrict conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MelgiJ"&gt;One, a Black woman in her 20s who’s studying medicine, said she has been barred from rooms discussing vaccination in Black communities, because one influential anti-vaxxer who frequents those rooms blocked her. She also found herself abruptly shut out of a weekly &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; watch-party club that had become her favorite experience on the app, evidently because one member had blocked her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LdPKni"&gt;The buzz around Clubhouse— which attracted 10 million users in its inaugural year— has &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over"&gt;started to fizzle out&lt;/a&gt; a bit; it only recently released a version for Android devices, and new users can only join when invited by a current user. Add to that the rising popularity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;superior accessibility of Twitter’s audio chat platform Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems Clubhouse may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/clubhouse-has-blocking-problem/618867/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;Go read this analysis&lt;/a&gt; of why its unusual blocking system may ultimately contribute to the platform’s decline. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline says operations back to normal following ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Atlantic Gasoline Flows Surge On Colonial Spill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06OaLnSDtg4VorIrGoec8nZJvJg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292718/608064472.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeagMe"&gt;Colonial Pipeline said Saturday that all of its systems are back to operating normally, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;pipeline it shut down a week ago&lt;/a&gt; amid a ransomware attack. The pipeline is now servicing all its markets including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, DC, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, the company tweeted. Colonial carries 45 percent of the fuel supplies for the eastern United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YprrWR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we previously reported, Colonial Pipeline initiated the restart of pipeline operations at approximately 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 12. Since that time, we have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the markets we serve. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UJG7SqUxSQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UJG7SqUxSQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Colonial Pipeline (@Colpipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529174598504454?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbuwkZ"&gt;The company reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a $5 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; to DarkSide, the group responsible for the incident. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;DarkSide has since apologized&lt;/a&gt; for the “social consequences” of the attack, which included fuel shortages in many of the markets that the 5,500-mile-long pipeline services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifimv3"&gt;It remains unclear which parts of the Colonial Pipeline were at risk, but a company spokesperson suggested it did not appear that the company’s operational systems were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rs8Q6F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The cybersecurity ‘pandemic’ that led to the Colonial Pipeline disaster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429433/colonial-pipeline-cyber-security-ransomware-attack"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LiAURW"&gt;Colonial &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529184174198787"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it has invested “meaningfully” in its IT and cybersecurity, and said it would “continue to put safety and system integrity first.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z64CK8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Since this incident began, we have been clear that our focus was on the safe and efficient restoration of service to our pipeline system. That is what we have achieved through the commitment and dedication of the many Colonial team members.&lt;/p&gt;— Colonial Pipeline (@Colpipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Colpipe/status/1393529181447852032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yd4uNR"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/15/colonial-pipeline-resumes-normal-operations-after-hack.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC,&lt;/em&gt; there are still fuel shortages&lt;/a&gt; in many of the markets the affected pipeline serves; it reported 80 percent of gas stations in Washington, DC were still without fuel as of Saturday morning. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is reportedly continuing a ban on anti-coup groups in Myanmar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWuyZsTB73Jql1G3uPp3vwWD6rA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292441/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3amtd"&gt;Facebook has reportedly upheld a ban on many organizations in Myanmar that have joined forces to resist the military coup that occurred back in February, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/facebook-is-still-censoring-groups-fighting-the-military-coup-in-myanmar/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bans were put in place back in 2019, when organizations like the Arakan Army, and many of its allies, were classified as terrorist organizations by the democratically-elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IE5Jnd"&gt;Things have changed in Myanmar since then. After the military coup and government takeover by the Tatmadaw (carried out after an election which &lt;a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/election-fraud-01282021184631.html"&gt;the military claims was fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;), the political situation has become extremely complex. There is, however, one thing that is seemingly clear: the Arakan Army is no longer classified as a terrorist organization, either by the &lt;a href="https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-military-regime-removes-arakan-army-list-terrorist-groups.html"&gt;current military-led government&lt;/a&gt;, or by the &lt;a href="https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news/myanmar-military-not-eaos-only-terrorist-organisation-in-myanmar-crph-says"&gt;elected government currently in exile&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, according to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the Arakan Army is still not allowed on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy9M8F"&gt;The AA isn’t the only group that’s found itself unable to communicate through Facebook. There are apparently many ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) active in the country, some of which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22412118/myanmar-coup-protesters-rohingya"&gt;have banded together as a resistance&lt;/a&gt; to the coup government, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/13/22329081/myanmar-protests-killed-casualties"&gt;violently cracking down on pro-democracy protestors&lt;/a&gt;. Many of their Facebook pages were also restricted back in 2019, under orders of the democratically elected government, which has since been overthrown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLgycN"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;, the ban of EAOs was controversial before the coup as well: some argue that it prevented the spread of information about human rights violations, like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41566561"&gt;the genocide against the Rohingya Muslims&lt;/a&gt; carried out by the Tatmadaw. Now, EAOs and journalists in the country argue that Facebook’s bans prevent them from showing what’s happening in the struggle against the current military government. The director of a human rights organization told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the bans are “like trying to close the people’s eyes and ears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdlxGy"&gt;Facebook also &lt;a href="https://time.com/5943151/facebook-myanmar-military-ban/"&gt;banned pages associated with the Tatmadaw&lt;/a&gt; following the coup, but human rights activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi tells &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the company has still failed to react to the political changes that have occurred in Myanmar since then, and called on the company to create an official oversight board for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be working on Twitter Blue, a subscription service that would cost $2.99 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DrXZxW9zkRnSgMqroLciklrDtY4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292410/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IV4i7C"&gt;Twitter has previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;confirmed that it’s exploring&lt;/a&gt; a paid subscription model for some features, and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted Saturday that she’s discovered how much it will cost and what it will be called. Twitter Blue, Wong says, will cost $2.99 per month, and will include an Undo Tweets feature and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393287285156859911?s=20"&gt;bookmark collections&lt;/a&gt;. Wong says it appears Twitter is working on a tiered subscription model, which she posits could mean a less-cluttered, premium experience for the highest-paying subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zgZgW2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is calling their upcoming Subscription Service “Twitter Blue”, priced at $2.99/month for now, including paid features like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undo Tweets: &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH"&gt;https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collections: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o"&gt;https://t.co/qfFfAXHp1o&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yyMStpCkpr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yyMStpCkpr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2u2xPw"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment Saturday, but the company doesn’t usually confirm or otherwise comment on Wong’s typically accurate discoveries of new features before they launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqIiMQ"&gt;Twitter has made a slew of new product announcements over the past several weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420586/twitter-offensive-tweet-warning-prompt-updated-success-rate"&gt;updating its warnings&lt;/a&gt; for potentially offensive tweets, improving its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;photo cropping algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to allow “taller” images to fully display in users’ feeds, adding the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434936/twitter-dm-search-android-expanding"&gt;Android users to search&lt;/a&gt; their direct messages, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;rolling out a Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; to allow users to make donations to some creators, journalists, experts, and non-profits (although that last one raised some &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx55k4/psa-twitters-new-tip-jar-can-reveal-your-address"&gt;privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt; about what user information is included along with the tip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5d9SP"&gt;And earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;Twitter acquired Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, the $5-per-month subscription service that removes ads from websites that participate. With the Scroll announcement, Twitter also said it would be winding down Nuzzel, a Scroll service that sent users daily email roundups of top stories in their Twitter feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PkuKt"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393639463746641923?s=20"&gt;Wong noted&lt;/a&gt; in a later tweet, Tony Haile, the former CEO of Scroll who is now on the product team at Twitter, tweeted the day his company was acquired that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arctictony/status/1389565785555836929?s=20"&gt;Scroll would “integrate into a broader Twitter subscription later in the year.”&lt;/a&gt; That would seem to suggest that one of the offerings of a premium Twitter product would be an ad-free experience, something it seems diehard tweeters have asked for almost as much as editable tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46o8Eb"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;first-quarter earnings report&lt;/a&gt; late last month, Twitter had a profit of $68 million on revenue of $1.04 billion. The company reported a 20 percent increase in monetizable daily active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmgMo6"&gt;There’s no word  yet on when a premium paid version of Twitter would launch, or who would be eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0egjgi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 15th 3:09PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds that Twitter declined comment, and additional detail about Twitter’s acquisition of Scroll.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How far have you gone for internet access?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFMm-Tbdb1rhimDTY5fPzPBC8fU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69292292/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONt52x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421637/infrastructure-week-broadband-hospitals-biden-plan-ev-charging"&gt;Infrastructure Week&lt;/a&gt; focused partly on how dire the broadband problem currently is for Americans. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;we showed you a map&lt;/a&gt; of the worst counties for broadband in the US — and on Friday, we closed the week by showing how satellite services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; aren’t enough to close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VeSTgq"&gt;But even for the people who do have high-speed internet access, many of them have done desperate things to secure access to it. Our team resides all around the US, and they’ve shared some personal tales below about their experiences getting (or failing to get) high-speed internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmPUzF"&gt;But we also want to know what lengths &lt;em&gt;you’ve&lt;/em&gt; gone to for internet access. Did you have to plead with an unwilling internet service provider to branch out its high-speed service to your area? Did you resort to using a device in an unintended way to get internet access? Did you use any clever workarounds to improve your internet (or piggy-back on a neighbor’s)? Share your story in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="akDgYb"&gt;
&lt;p id="3xIejD"&gt;When I came back from college one summer, I found my mom had switched from dial-up to slightly faster RF-based internet. There was a little dish on our back porch pointed at the grain elevators in town (the largest building in the area). The internet providers were just a couple of nice young dudes who were using cable lines to string internet from the center of town to the grain elevators where they would then beam it out to people too far away to get DSL or cable. The internet was usually fine but would slow down or stop altogether if there was interference. Usually, it was a bad storm or heavy fog. But the worst was whenever the hay fields between the grain elevators and my home were harvested. It would kick up dust and leave me totally internet-less. I got very comfortable playing &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; in coffee shops and diners in rural North Texas. &lt;strong&gt;— Alex Cranz, managing editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="jxvtcm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K5vNY2"&gt;The internet at my parents’ house (where I’ve spent a good amount of the pandemic working, since my 200-square-foot apartment isn’t an ideal office) is mind-bogglingly slow. This is a problem for me as someone who reviews laptops, and especially gaming laptops, because I constantly need to download things. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;took almost four days to load onto my drive on my parents’ internet, for example, and it was bogging everything else down so much that I needed to find another solution. So I want to take this space to shout out the Congregational Church of Salisbury, which has allowed me to absolutely pummel their holy internet with piles of heavy downloads several times this year. There’s no experience more serene than spending the morning in an empty chapel, hearing the chirps of birds echo through windows and across the pews, feeling at peace with nature and God, as you download AAA game after AAA game. &lt;strong&gt;— Monica Chin, writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmY0SZ"&gt;Back in the days when getting access to data internationally cost a small fortune, a friend of mine came up with the ingenious workaround of using the free 3G connection on his Kindle as a workaround. He spent an entire summer using the basic browser built into his e-reader to load up Google Maps and find his way around. It was a painful process, and I don’t think he got anywhere particularly quickly, but it was better than having to pay the international roaming rates being charged at the time. &lt;strong&gt;— Jon Porter, news reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJOX2h"&gt;Being a freelance video professional and needing to upload large files means my internet connection can be the difference between spending a day to get a video online or a few minutes. Unfortunately, living in NYC means I pretty much only have one option for internet from the legacy cable provider (Spectrum). Like most cable providers, they offer decent download speeds but throttle the upload speeds to the same measly 30mbps across all their plans, and even then you rarely get the full 30mbps. I wanted fiber internet because it offers modern bandwidth for uploads, but there was little incentive for Verizon FiOS to run their service into the pre-war building I live in on the Upper West Side. I was determined, though, and went door to door to every resident in the building to get enough signatures showing interest in having a fiber option for internet. After getting a majority of the tenants to sign on and calling and writing to Verizon every week for almost six months, I was able to get them to coordinate with the landlord to install service to our building. Now an average video that would take several hours to upload can be put online in a few minutes. Being able to fix a problem or make a quick change to a video for a client allows me to accommodate client requests that many other producers would not be able to handle. My upload speed can be the real difference between getting the next job or not.  &lt;strong&gt;— Liam James, producer on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVf6CF"&gt;I was studying in mainland China during a big crackdown on US websites in college. So I spent half the year playing a constant game of whack-a-mole with Tor and a series of sketchy (but faster) free web proxies whose names and links got passed around my cohort like we were sharing the passwords to a speakeasy. I’m lucky I didn’t end up with some kind of horrific malware, but on the bright side, it’s the only time I could imagine feeling cool and rebellious visiting Facebook. &lt;strong&gt;— Adi Robertson, senior reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SjVIP"&gt;My family didn’t upgrade from dial-up until around 2012, which meant that we also didn’t have Wi-Fi. Of course, I wasn’t going to let that stop me from getting Online, so I did what any preteen would do: grabbed my PSP 2000 and roamed around my neighborhood looking for unprotected hotspots. I ended up finding one right by our house (hi neighbors!), and eagerly connected to it. Thankfully, there was a tree in the exact perfect spot, where I was as close to their property as I could’ve been without technically trespassing. That unprotected Wi-Fi hotspot and my PSP’s web browser were my main access to the internet for about a year — I would hang in, on, or around the tree, surfing the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aoHSt"&gt;I realize that this may mean I was one of the PSP web browser’s top users, and I know I had a few JavaScript bookmarklets installed, though I don’t remember what they did. I know that most of what I was doing were the types of things I didn’t want to or couldn’t do on the public desktop: setting up a secret MySpace account to talk to my fake middle school girlfriend and playing multiplayer games (though I usually couldn’t finish them, as the connection was, understandably, super flaky). &lt;strong&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEAN3F"&gt;Dial-up internet was the only option during my teenage years living on the outskirts of a small town in Ohio. We got service through CompuServe, and it showed its limitations when I needed to do pretty much anything other than using MySpace, Xanga, or GameFaqs for text-only gaming guides. I remember it took a week to download a 63MB trailer for &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&lt;/em&gt; on Kazaa. So, it was totally inadequate for playing online games like &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox 360, which all of my friends were playing at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8tVc6"&gt;To get something that could even be considered high-speed internet at our house (I recall that speed being well under 500Kbps for download and upload speeds), I had to repeatedly call and plead with the local ISP to bring it out to where I lived, about 20 miles out of town. It eventually worked after a few months of persistence. I got my way, and I could &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;play synchronous multiplayer games online for the first time ever. Shortly thereafter, a stranger online in &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt; told me he was going to come to my house and kill me, so I quit playing it entirely. &lt;strong&gt;— Cameron Faulkner, writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G78y9g"&gt;There are four rooms in my apartment. Living room —&amp;gt; Kitchen —&amp;gt; Bathroom —&amp;gt; Bedroom. Thick concrete walls between each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfcASv"&gt;My router is in the living room. It does not reliably reach the bedroom. If I leave the bedroom door all the way open, I might maintain a consistent signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnEEAT"&gt;I know I need to buy an Eero or something, but I keep thinking a better model will come out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnRd8B"&gt;So instead, I bought a $30 Wi-Fi repeater and a long extension cable. I ran the cable from a power outlet in the kitchen out into the hallway (there are no outlets in the hallway) that leads to the bedroom. The cable is somewhat tactfully hidden around a doorframe using a series of tiny nails meant for hanging picture frames and thread to hold the cable in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pL1ZS3"&gt;The Wi-Fi repeater is now hovering near the ceiling, halfway between the router and bedroom. If I connect to it, I can get AOL-grade speeds in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKLZxP"&gt;It’s been there for 12 months now. I never use it.&lt;strong&gt;— Jake Kastrenakes, senior editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRGovd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlEL4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG3k9M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0L2xuk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o52Wqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoltOU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="BV2gd3"&gt;President Biden on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/14/executive-order-on-the-revocation-of-certain-presidential-actions-and-technical-amendment/"&gt;revoked several of former President Trump’s executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, including one that would have changed legal protections for social media sites and other online platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMLIC8"&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act limits how much online platforms can be held liable for content users share on their platforms. The Trump order, titled “preventing online censorship,” would have allowed federal authorities to hold companies like Twitter, Google, and Facebook responsible if they were found to be infringing on users’ speech by deleting or otherwise modifying users’ posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB5SPn"&gt;Trump signed the order last May, just as Twitter started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;applying labels to his tweets as “misleading.”&lt;/a&gt; Trump was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for tweets inciting the January 6th riot at the US Capitol. A similar ban by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;Facebook remains in effect&lt;/a&gt; while the company reevaluates it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X31hif"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s go through Trump’s terrible internet censorship order, line by line","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21273191/trump-twitter-social-media-censorship-executive-order-analysis-bias"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTdqd5"&gt;In addition to revoking the executive order that would have changed Section 230, Biden revoked a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-signs-executive-order-punish-vandalism-against-federal-monuments-n1232322"&gt;2020 Trump order&lt;/a&gt; that would have allowed the government to prosecute people who caused damage to statues or monuments, and put a halt to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/04/trump-garden-of-american-heroes-348761"&gt;Trump’s plan to create&lt;/a&gt; a National Garden of American Heroes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5NJaj"&gt;President Biden also revoked a 2019 Trump order that would have &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-require-applicants-for-immigrant-visas-to-show-proof-of-health-coverage-11570228956?mod=article_inline"&gt;required immigrants to the US&lt;/a&gt; to prove they could afford healthcare as part of their visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;
