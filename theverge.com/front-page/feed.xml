    <title>Joe Budden is bringing his podcast to Patreon </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FjAY0"&gt;Four months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;ending his exclusive Spotify deal&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Budden is bringing his podcast to Patreon and has been made an adviser to the company, taking on the title head of creator equity. Like many other podcasters on Patreon, his show will be available freely on most podcasting platforms — with the notable exception of Spotify — and paying supporters will have access to additional perks. Both his show, &lt;em&gt;The Joe Budden Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, and his network, The Joe Budden Network, will be supported through the same Patreon page with the same subscription cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEcL3X"&gt;Subscribers can pay between $5 and $25 a month for bonus content, a private Discord, and exclusive tour deals. Budden tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he and his team will also gate new shows as exclusives for Patreon subscribers, with them possibly being released more widely after a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmmhPA"&gt;The message from this move is clear: although many podcasters are committing to exclusive deals, Budden doesn’t see them as the future of podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4y7a4J"&gt;“That is so prehistoric,” he says, explaining that when he signed his Spotify deal three years ago, he and Spotify both wanted to see if exclusive deals could work. He says he proved the model, along with the potential of his audience, but didn’t want Spotify to use his fans and reach to prove the platform’s own worth and make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K8a6EO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subscription tiers range from $5 to $25 per month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iS3H5A"&gt;“For many years, the record labels and the system that I come from tricked us into thinking they were doing us a favor by capitalizing off our talent and basically loaning us money, and that’s been the standard the entire time,” Budden says, adding that he already knows how that system worked out for creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3ugww"&gt;When Budden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;announced his split&lt;/a&gt; from the tech company, he said Spotify was “pillaging” his audience and only cared about how his show contributed to Spotify overall, not about his actual podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlSV21"&gt;Jack Conte, the CEO of Patreon, says Budden is on a standard Patreon plan, where the company takes a cut of his subscription revenue, but having him as an adviser sets him apart from other creators and emphasizes the company’s interest in hearing from him directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBb08l"&gt;“This is about tech companies paying creators the minimum amount that they can get away with instead of paying creators what they’re actually worth,” Conte says. “Creators are uploading gold to these platforms — billions of hours of energy, and enthusiasm, and passion, and creativity, and storytelling, and excitement — all the stuff that we love to read, and listen to, and watch, and see and hear, and creators are getting paid fractions of what they’re actually worth. And not only that, they’re disconnected from their audiences. They don’t own the relationship with their audience. They don’t get data. They don’t get to run their own business. They get locked out of their business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hd5oLL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Budden is being made the head of creator equity at Patreon as part of the deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3NMRFv"&gt;Budden’s not the only one to have spoken out about how Spotify treats creators. The hosts of &lt;em&gt;The Nod,&lt;/em&gt; which became a Spotify-owned show after the company acquired Gimlet Media, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308074/the-nod-spotify-rss-feed-another-round-buzzfeed-podcast-ownership"&gt;spoke out&lt;/a&gt; in June about their issues with show ownership. The hosts, Brittany Luse and Eric Eddings, say they built their show and audience but owned none of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMPg3i"&gt;“At the end of the day, investing in someone’s talent isn’t the same as having the talent yourself,” Luse told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s very strange that [Spotify and Gimlet] are the only people who can claim ownership over [&lt;em&gt;The Nod&lt;/em&gt; and its segments].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0S7Ot"&gt;Still, Spotify has continued to sign deals with big-name talent, including Michelle Obama, Kim Kardashian West, Meghan Markle, and Prince Harry. It’s also continued to encourage small creators to try podcasting through its creation software, Anchor. Patreon is setting itself up as the antithesis to exclusives — a place where podcasters can reward their most loyal fans while also benefiting from the freedom to do whatever they want with their show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will now warn you about videos with questionable information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mOdqMYYpzMY2NH_nJv8cFLCPOB0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761761/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHW5sb"&gt;TikTok will start displaying warnings on videos that contain questionable information that couldn’t be verified by fact-checkers, and it’ll begin warning users when they go to re-share those videos that the information hasn’t been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1yeuL"&gt;The app will now display a warning label on these videos that reads, “Caution: Video flagged for unverified content.” This means a fact-checker looked at the content but wasn’t able to certify that it was right or wrong. TikTok has already been reducing the spread of some unverified videos, but they weren’t publicly flagged before today. Creators will now get a message when a warning label is added to their video, and those videos will all have their distribution reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v0MoqtsXkRLKRLgz3R5uT1y7aQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277165/New_prompts_to_consider_before_sharing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv2zdj"&gt;Viewers will also be warned when they go to re-share a video that has a warning label on it. After clicking the share button, which lets you post a video outside the app, a pop-up will ask if you’re “sure you want to share this video?” You can still share the video if you want to, but the prompt seems to be designed to dissuade some people from following through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RefQqK"&gt;TikTok didn’t say how many videos it looks at each day for fact-checking or how it chooses which videos to review. A spokesperson said that fact-checking is often focused on topics like elections, vaccines, and climate change and that a video doesn’t have to reach a certain popularity to qualify for review. Videos that violate TikTok’s misinformation policy will be removed outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RY0oo"&gt;Other social apps have tried similar warnings over the past year to limit the spread of misinformation. Facebook warns you before you share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365305/facebook-covid-19-warning-notification-post-misinformation"&gt;stories about COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304173/facebook-old-news-articles-warning-notification-time"&gt;articles that may be out of date&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter will warn you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611927/twitter-show-warning-like-labeled-tweet"&gt;before retweeting potential misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and on a much funnier note, will also suggest that you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;open and read through a news story&lt;/a&gt; before you repost it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify subscribers surge past 150 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dh2qHjq5oNbJnPW85fJGfKOBOSw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761608/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUS9Dz"&gt;Spotify now boasts 155 million premium subscribers and 345 million monthly active users, according to its &lt;a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-2020/default.aspx"&gt;latest earnings report released today&lt;/a&gt;. Those numbers represent a 24 percent and 27 percent year-over year increase. Its biggest increase was in ad-supported monthly active users, which rose 30 percent to 199 million. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-10-29/spotify-reports-third-quarter-2020-earnings/"&gt;Last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, it reported having reached 144 million subscribers, and 320 million monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOoCJE"&gt;However, despite the growth in listeners, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-with-focus-on-podcasts-11612350000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the average revenue per user fell by 8 percent to €4.26 (around $5.13) compared to a year ago. That’s because of the discounted plans used to lure in new subscribers, and the lower prices it charges in markets like Russia and India. Ad revenue was up, however, accounting for 13 percent of revenue despite historically bringing in less than 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHzt5xeRsDYXJWtgJry9747l42k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278130/Header_Gif.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify now has 345 million monthly active users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xWIlm3"&gt;Overall Spotify still made a loss of €125 million, but that’s down from the €209 million loss it made the year before. It’s rare for Spotify to post a profit as the company continues to invest in growth, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sREQZL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify continues to sign big names for its podcast business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iA0HB"&gt;The earnings announcement comes as Spotify continues to make big investments outside of music, the service’s traditional strength. It recently made moves into audiobooks, experimenting with offering recordings of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248393/spotify-audiobook-exclusive-recordings-david-dobrick-hilary-swank"&gt;celebrities reading public domain books&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYOV0p"&gt;Spotify is also investing heavily in podcast. This quarter, the company continued to sign big names for its podcast business like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176014/prince-harry-meghan-markle-podcast-spotify-exclusive-archewell-audio"&gt;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242381/ava-duvernay-spotify-podcast-audio-deal-exclusive"&gt;Ava Duvernay&lt;/a&gt;. It now offers more than 2.2 million podcasts through its service, with podcast consumption up nearly 100 percent compared to the same time a year ago. Spotify says that 25 percent of its users engaged with podcast content during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FqMxN"&gt;Spotify has argued that its investment in podcasts in particular increases usage, engagement, and customer retention, and present an opportunity for it to decrease its reliance on licensing music from labels. Spotify reiterated that belief in today’s earnings release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADCmc"&gt;However, some analysts say the investment in podcasts has yet to meaningfully pay off, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/spotifys-big-bet-on-podcasts-is-failing-citi-says.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBNC&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt;. Writing in an investor note, analysts at Citi said that “to date, we have not seen a material positive inflection in app downloads or Premium subscriptions” as a result of Spotify’s podcast investments. Last year, reports indicated that Spotify was exploring the possibility of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552822/spotify-podcast-subscription-service-survey"&gt;subscription podcast service&lt;/a&gt;, opening up another source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9K1wYY"&gt;This earnings report won’t be Spotify’s last major announcement of the month. Yesterday the company teased a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyNews/status/1356648594460315648"&gt;Stream On&lt;/a&gt;” event taking place on February 22nd. In today’s release, the company said it will use the event “to share the latest on the state of global audio streaming and where it’s headed in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poly’s new monitor has a built-in mic, camera, and even lighting for video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bUvUYO2YSHBpz7oVr5eR5w-dMG8=/0x0:1613x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761456/Studio_P21_In_call_Lifestyle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poly’s P21 display has a built in webcam, microphone, speakers, and lighting.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Poly&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mN7yuw"&gt;Poly, the &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-plantronics-poly-polycom.html"&gt;brand launched&lt;/a&gt; after headset-manufacturer Plantronics bought video conferencing company Polycom &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/02/1532616/0/en/Plantronics-Completes-Acquisition-of-Polycom.html"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, is announcing a new lineup of office gear for the work-from-home era. There’s the $129 Poly Studio P5 webcam, the $599 Poly Studio P15 Personal Video Bar, and the $815 Poly Studio P21 Personal Meeting Display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnaohW"&gt;The P21 display is particularly interesting. Although it’s fundamentally a 21-inch monitor, it’s designed to make the most of video calls. It’s got a built in webcam with a physical privacy shutter, microphone, and integrated stereo speakers. There’s even a pair of ambient lights on its left and right sides to keep your face well-illuminated on video calls. Its stand doubles as a wireless charger, and there are video call shortcut buttons along the bottom of the screen, including one to quickly mute your microphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca12Eu"&gt;There’s no mention of the monitor’s resolution or panel type &lt;a href="https://www.poly.com/us/en/products/video-conferencing/studio-p/studio-p21?utm_medium=media&amp;amp;utm_source=press_release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GL-PS-FY21Q4-OzProductLaunch%E2%80%94EN&amp;amp;cnid=7013t000001l3I1"&gt;on its product page&lt;/a&gt;, and Poly is specifically pitching it as a “second or backup display” despite advertising it as “pro-grade.” So suffice it to say, this probably isn’t going to replace your main monitor anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ex7nMzlL-D3HysGKaeuo0NASNSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278097/Studio_P15_Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poly P15 Personal Video Bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jzZA0mm_B0RunKBQ4b_n1VVVRX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278098/Studio_P5_Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poly Studio P5 webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMJJmE"&gt;The P15 Personal Video Bar is a 4K webcam (capable of automatically keeping you in frame) with a built-in speaker and microphone. Then there’s the Poly Studio P5, a 1080p webcam with up to 4x digital zoom, and a built in USB Type-A connector that lets you plug a headsets’ wireless receiver directly into the back of the camera. Both cameras have built-in privacy shutters. It’s also selling bundles of its Studio P5 webcam with an included headset or speakerphone, starting at $149.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjYOdC"&gt;Poly has been in the video conferencing business for a while, first as Polycom, and as Poly since &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-plantronics-poly-polycom.html"&gt;its 2019 rebrand&lt;/a&gt;. Its latest product launch follows a huge increase in the amount of people working from home which is expected to continue long after the immediate health dangers of the pandemic pass. The last year has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21199521/webcam-shortage-price-raise-logitech-razer-amazon-best-buy-ebay"&gt;seen webcam shortages&lt;/a&gt; as people upgraded their home video calling setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aedALW"&gt;All three new products will be available beginning in April, Poly says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HX1KA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqiwUu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony sold 4.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j5AZ__pvMlw_E9osPwEfPdXr1Vs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761261/vpavic_4278_20201030_0301.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gxWfOb"&gt;Sony shipped 4.5 million PlayStation 5 units worldwide in 2020, as revealed by information &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/20q3_supplement.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; alongside the company’s latest earnings report. The number highlights Sony’s current ability to mass-produce the console, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;extremely difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt; since its launch in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZv49A"&gt;Demand for the PlayStation 4 dropped dramatically year-on-year, with 1.4 million units shipped in the October-December quarter — a 77 percent decrease from the previous year. Sony actually managed to sell fewer PS4s in the holiday quarter than it did from July to September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lglW5p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best quarter in PlayStation history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VI9X02"&gt;Sony’s gaming business overall performed much better than a year ago, with analyst Daniel Ahmad &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1356860649402425344"&gt;noting&lt;/a&gt; that it was actually the best quarter in PlayStation history. Revenue increased 40 percent to 883.2 billion yen ($8.4 billion), partly driven by PS5 sales. Operating profit was up by 50 percent to 80.2 billion yen ($763.3 million) because of higher game sales, PlayStation Plus subscriptions, and better margins on PS4 hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2H7Fd"&gt;Sony does note, however, that expenses related to the PS5 launch offset some of its profit gains, and also confirms that the PS5 hardware itself is being sold for less than it costs to make. A loss was incurred due to “strategic price points for PS5 hardware that were set lower than the manufacturing costs,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZV4S3"&gt;There’s not much to read into PS5 sales numbers until people who want to buy one are actually able to do so. But at the very least, the console’s launch seems to be broadly comparable in size to the PS4’s; the PS4 also shipped 4.5 million units in its launch quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj8lNK"&gt;Microsoft didn’t release specific sales figures for the Xbox Series X or Series S with its earnings report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250826/microsoft-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, but the company did say that Xbox hardware revenue was up 86 percent year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s next folding phone is coming on February 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkhnGnxiwkQIkLnmrqkWocgmnoU=/0x0:690x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761147/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KEqkw4"&gt;Huawei will announce a new flagship foldable phone later this month, according to a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K0bsQcYma"&gt;Weibo post&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s official page. Based on the name, the Mate X2 sounds like it should be a more substantial followup to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;original Mate X&lt;/a&gt; than Huawei’s last foldable phone, the faster and slightly tweaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lFCft"&gt;Unless Huawei is being deliberately cryptic, the teaser image for the Mate X2 actually suggests that the phone could possibly switch to a different folding screen design with the flexible panel on the inside, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold line&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Mate X phones had a single panel that wrapped around the outside when closed, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole’s Flexpai devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzTHsP"&gt;Otherwise, there’s not much in the way of details on the Mate X2 yet. It’s likely that it’ll have the same Kirin 9000 processor found in the Mate 40 Pro, and of course Huawei probably still won’t be able to include Google apps and services on board, limiting the device’s viability outside of China unless something changes unexpectedly quickly with the new Biden administration’s approach to sanctions. Huawei’s hardware is always worth paying attention to, though, so stay tuned for more news and details on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This hypercar is China’s first Belt and Road electric vehicle project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGjN1FpR9y9fq633G-tmexhqCig=/0x61:2047x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761011/473ADF4A_12AD_49FD_A400_E6F67E8D930A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Silk EV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QaDl3Y"&gt;A new engineering and design startup called Silk EV headquartered in Italy’s venerable Motor Valley is more than just another attempt at making an electric hypercar. It’s also the latest arrow in the quiver for China’s massive Belt and Road project, though the first that deals with electric cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN9aT0"&gt;Silk EV announced on Tuesday that it will co-develop an “ultra-luxury hypercar” called the S9 in the home region of Lamborghini and Ferrari with First Automobile Works (FAW), China’s original state-owned automaker. The S9 will be part of the Chinese automaker’s longstanding Hongqi brand, which means “red flag” and was once exclusively made for high-ranking Chinese government officials before becoming more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgOVz7"&gt;The two companies didn’t release any specifications about the S9, or any photos, save for a teaser image. In a press release, Silk EV said the vehicles it makes with FAW will “combine a dynamic, sustainable, and exclusive driving experience with the use of cutting-edge technology and innovation, delivering to China and the world the next-generation of luxury new energy vehicles.” One of the few things announced Tuesday is that the car is being designed by Walter de Silva, who has styled vehicles for Alfa Romeo, Audi, and Lamborghini, and headed up design for the Volkswagen Group in the late 2000s and early 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxAZET"&gt;China’s Belt and Road initiative is a massive effort to spin up infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe, and Africa that, in total, roughly trace the old Silk Road. The projects span dozens of countries and vary in size and scope. There are massive railways, hydropower plants, dams, and bridges. And in some places, like Djibouti, &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF11304.pdf"&gt;China is attempting to do nearly all of the above&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JowODN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Belt and Road has, until now, been more about infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ysxqGA"&gt;While the Chinese government frames the Belt and Road initiative as one &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OubM8bD9kck"&gt;ripe with diplomatic and economic opportunity&lt;/a&gt;, the country has been accused of saddling some of its smaller partners with debt, leaving them susceptible to Beijing’s influence. Other projects have been criticized for favoring, or even requiring, the use of Chinese construction companies during &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative"&gt;unusually opaque bidding processes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fu9Pap"&gt;The best of China’s many EV startups have long aimed to expand outside the country, though only one — XPeng — has followed through on that promise &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/xpeng-delivers-first-evs-to-norway-in-slow-going-europe-entry?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;after beginning deliveries to Europe in December&lt;/a&gt;. Larger, more established automakers have kept their focus on exploiting the vast opportunity for consumer electric vehicles inside China, especially after the government began favoring clean energy vehicles a few years ago. (Commercial vehicles are a different story; major automaker BYD, for instance, sells electric buses in the US.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd8zvF"&gt;With electric vehicle technology maturing, and China controlling the bulk of the supply chain, an outward expansion from an established player only makes sense. And FAW is an unsurprising partner for Silk EV. Not only is the company’s Honqi brand recognizable throughout China, but FAW has shown an interest in electric vehicles, having helped kickstart EV startup Byton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W5O7c"&gt;Byton once had its own global ambitions. But it ran into financial trouble last year and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212994/byton-foxconn-electric-vehicles-china-shutdown-extended"&gt;now retreating from the US&lt;/a&gt; and reportedly being rolled up into FAW. (Former CEO of Byton Carsten Breitfeld, who now helms Faraday Future, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875328/byton-carsten-breitfeld-first-auto-works-chinese-government"&gt;accused the Chinese government of exerting influence on the startup through FAW in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HApV4u"&gt;While Italy makes sense as a target market to make and sell a hypercar, it’s also a logical political partner for a project like this, as it was the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-china-president-idUSKCN1R40DV"&gt;first G7 nation to endorse the Belt and Road initiative&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epV2j"&gt;Xu Liuping, the chairman and party secretary of FAW, said in a press release that the joint venture with Silk EV “marks a major milestone under the Belt and Road initiative for China, Italy and the global automotive industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPUoWn"&gt;“It is a unique opportunity for FAW to build on its legacy of carmaking excellence in Jilin province — the center of China’s automotive industry — and for FAW Group to come together with Italy’s Motor Valley — renowned for its luxury and racing automotive heritage, integrated ecosystem, and world-class engineering — to become the new benchmark in new energy vehicles,” Xu said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Cyberpunk 2077 security exploit makes installing mods risky business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3YvDPiRl_8CpmUj2bTUEkT02yU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760452/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GiPRVQ"&gt;CD Projekt Red has warned players that installing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; mods or custom save files on the PC could pose a security risk (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-players-warned-to-avoid-mods-after-secur-1846184796"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the company’s tweet, there’s apparently a “vulnerability in external DLL files the game uses which can be used to execute code on PCs.” The game’s official mod tools were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252373/cyberpunk-2077-official-mod-support"&gt;just released last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcAmqN"&gt;The company warns users not to install files from unknown sources, though &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-players-warned-to-avoid-mods-after-secur-1846184796"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, that pretty much rules out all mods unless you can read and understand their code. When you’re dealing with a vulnerability that could potentially lead to arbitrary code running on your computer, it’s probably best not to risk it until a fix is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="slw3Z0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you plan to use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CyberpunkGame&lt;/a&gt; mods/custom saves on PC, use caution. We've been made aware of a vulnerability in external DLL files the game uses which can be used to execute code on PCs. Issue will be fixed ASAP. For now, please refrain from using files from unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt;— CD PROJEKT RED CS (@CDPRED_Support) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPRED_Support/status/1356604047671898112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5n7rV"&gt;This isn’t the first problem CD Projekt Red has faced with the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; mod system — the company also had to ask players to stop installing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253112/cyberpunk-2077-keanu-reeves-sex-mod-ban"&gt;mods that allowed them to have sex with Keanu Reeves’s character.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The GameStop stock roller coaster has come to the dip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jw82xSwkSVKVbtxGqKKUfAJ689k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760120/slack_imgs.com.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbFmvo"&gt;It hasn’t been a good day for WallStreetBets, as GameStop’s stock has plummeted today. AMC, the community’s other bet, dropped as well. But unlike previous dips, the stocks don’t appear to be rallying. Prices stayed low for the entire trading day, something that hasn’t happened since WallStreetBets became a household name one week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNIMZV"&gt;When the market closed today, the price of GameStop was $90 even, an 81 percent drop from GameStop’s peak at $483, and a 58 percent drop from its price of $218 on Friday evening. AMC is down too, closing today at $7.82, which is a 61 percent drop from its peak at $19.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDB84w"&gt;It’s hard to believe that in August of last year, GameStop was trading at $4.50. Between then and last week, some investors bet that the stock was undervalued, driving it up to around $30 a share. Then, the WallStreetBets subreddit decided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;it would take the stock to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, punishing those betting against it and attempting to make money in the process. The idea of buying at $4 a share and selling for $400 obviously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261036/wallstreet-bets-movie-adaptation-deals-netflix-mgm"&gt;captured the public’s imagination&lt;/a&gt;, and millions rushed to give trading a try as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;the GameStop meme&lt;/a&gt; went mainstream — taking AMC and others along for the ride as investors realized they could pump those stocks too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Graph of GameStop’s stock price over the past week." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r7KU23LfjouhdsxlIZEjyVmHlQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277376/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.57.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop’s stock over the past week, with a big ‘ol dip today. If this was a roller coaster track, it’d be a lot of fun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A graph of AMC’s stock price over the past week" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRv75OA9UEH9RShZWeVscrNyOXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277377/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_3.57.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, it’s not the same picture, just the same shape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T82PDq"&gt;As to whether this is the end of GameStop’s wild ride, it’s almost impossible to tell. The past week’s peaks, dips, and drops have been detached from the underlying businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfZbAJ"&gt;Part of that is the culture of WallStreetBets itself. Praising people for not selling their stocks, and ridiculing those that do is a recipe for a community that’s going to be stubborn. And now it’s started telling itself that the drop is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lax4z8/hardcore_laddering/"&gt;due to hedge fund market manipulation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owGj8F"&gt;If this news has made you feel like reading about other stock market shenanigans, &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; has an article &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html"&gt;that compares what’s happening now to the 2008 Volkswagen short squeeze&lt;/a&gt;, and Vox’s &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22262271/gamestop-bubble-robinhood-henry-blodget-interview"&gt;has an interview with Henry Blodget&lt;/a&gt;, who was involved with the Dotcom bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWQ7E"&gt;As for the people who have deep losses from today’s dive? They’re hoping for a rally, so they can at least sell for what they bought in for. Some, like Dutch student Evan Oosterink, are counting on it — he bet about $10,000, which represented “years of savings from his parents and some government college loans,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/gamestop-stock-plunge-losers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported.&lt;/a&gt; He lost about $9,000 today, but is still holding the stock in the hope that he can recoup his loss. “Being a part of WallStreetBets, it’s like a religion you’re devoted to,” he said to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VfUu0E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It was lovely reading those stories on Reddit about how GameStop stock changed their lives and will help them pay medical bills, save pets etc and I really, really, really hope they sold &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kcjwf4NNnN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kcjwf4NNnN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1356615785280602119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next macOS Big Sur update should make iPad apps look less awkward on the Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eiVcuQ_-cPPj7W5HLErWfl5YFQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68760005/akramer_201113_4290_0023.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alexander Kramer for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEfu9W"&gt;Apple just yesterday released its latest update for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; with improved Bluetooth reliability and a handful of bug fixes. And today, it’s rolling out the first beta of macOS Big Sur 11.3, which will bring further refinements to Safari, Reminders, Apple Music, Apple News, and other apps. This update will also try to improve the experience of running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs, which can still be a little awkward at this early stage (and without a touchscreen display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxHDgd"&gt;iPadOS apps will now appear larger than before — if your screen size allows for it — and beta testers will find a new preference pane for iPhone and iPad apps that’ll let them better personalize the “touch alternatives” keyboard commands. Touch alternatives allow for “keyboard alternatives for tap, swipe, and drag gestures, and enables multi-finger gestures using the option key and a trackpad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="c8j3Kj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"macOS 11 Big Sur review: a long time coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TPnC0Y"&gt;Big Sur 11.3 will make Safari’s start page more customizable, letting you rearrange the different sections (favorites, Reading List, Siri suggestions, etc.) to your own liking. Developers will gain the ability to make extensions that run on the new tab page, and they can also take advantage of a new web speech API to integrate speech recognition on their web pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASHWiF"&gt;As for the Reminders app, you’ll be able to sort your reminders based on title, due date, priority, or creation date. And with this update, Apple will let you easily &lt;em&gt;print&lt;/em&gt; your reminders if a paper copy might prove helpful when running to the store or completing other tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3YSYK"&gt;Apple Music gets small tweaks like a shortcut to your “Made for You” personalized playlists and mixes. Live and upcoming special events will be highlighted in the For You tab, as well. The Apple News app is undergoing some design improvements in the Apple News Plus tab to make your magazines and newspapers easier to reach (and download). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMd199"&gt;And like the upcoming iOS 14.5 update, macOS Big Sur 11.3 adds support for the latest Xbox and PlayStation DualSense controllers; the same compatibility is coming to Apple’s mobile devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;as part of iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
