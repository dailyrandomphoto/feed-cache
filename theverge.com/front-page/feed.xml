    <title>Robinhood says hackers also got thousands of phone numbers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APq2Ls"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;Robinhood has revealed&lt;/a&gt; that “several thousand entries” in a list obtained by hackers included phone numbers, indicating that a November 3rd security breach compromised more information than the company originally reported. More precisely, the list contains around 4,400 phone numbers &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vddm/robinhood-hack-included-thousands-of-phone-numbers"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reportedly obtained the list from a “proxy for the hackers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4AwHv"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770861/robinhood-7-million-customers-hacker-breach-extortion-security"&gt;Robinhood reported&lt;/a&gt; that an employee falling victim to a social engineering attack led to hackers obtaining 5 million customers’ emails, and 2 million customers’ names. Additionally, around 300 customers had more details like zip codes and dates of birth stolen, while 10 customers had “more extensive account details revealed.” Phone numbers weren’t mentioned in the company’s original post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TpZYRG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood reiterated that it doesn’t think SSNs or bank account numbers were stolen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTZjmg"&gt;Robinhood told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that it still believes information like Social Security, bank account, and debit card numbers weren’t compromised, but that it’s also analyzing “other text entries” in one of the lists the hackers obtained. The company also posted this information in an update to &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;its original blog post about the incident&lt;/a&gt; and said that it would “continue making appropriate disclosures to affected people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmrXp8"&gt;This isn’t the first bit of new information to come out since the company originally revealed that it had been hacked. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774954/robinhood-hack-screenshots-information-devices-bank-transfers-balance-phone-number"&gt;Screenshots reportedly showing the tools and extra information&lt;/a&gt; hackers had access to for around 10 accounts were also posted by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; last week, after the publication says they were provided by a source connected to the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZedNa"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; points out, access to Robinhood users’ phone numbers could make the users vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675709/sim-swapping-crypto-theft-iphone-8"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, or targeted phishing attacks from the hackers or anyone to whom they sold the numbers. It’s also concerning that Robinhood hadn’t released this information until more than a week after it first disclosed the attack. While it’s possible the company wasn’t aware the phone numbers had been taken, that’s not a particularly reassuring explanation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available for Verizon customers right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PmOquo2gnKbJMzQk40oYrm24Qw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155447/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuftUQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 17th, 1:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon’s waves of PlayStation 5 consoles on its site have ended for today, as it now only shows out of stock. We’ll be sure to keep you up to date when we hear about the next restocks from Verizon and all the usual retailers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPCXuo"&gt;If you’re shopping for Sony’s next-gen console, it may feel like a PlayStation 5 is one of the scarcest materials on the planet. The PS5 launched more than a year ago, yet it remains difficult to get a hold of one. Things have gotten a bit easier recently, with more frequent restocks from retailers and directly through Sony, but the struggle is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrbnyJ"&gt;But right now, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergePS5Verizon111721/https://www.verizon.com/products/sony-playstation-5-console-disc-edition-ps5/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon customers can pick up the standard, disc-based PS5 for $500&lt;/a&gt; directly from the carrier. The console listing is already up and the carrier is seemingly releasing stock in waves, so you have to get in there as soon as possible and see if luck is on your side today. Remember to log in to your Verizon cellular account while you wait and be sure your billing and shipping info is current, which will reduce the time it takes to check out and minimize the room for error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0MSo"&gt;If you don’t manage to nab a console today, fear not, we will continue serving you with details when more restocks happen. We are also happy to save you money on everyday purchases, so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard shareholders demand Bobby Kotick’s resignation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tMnvYk"&gt;Activision Blizzard shareholders &lt;a href="https://www.socinvestmentgroup.com/engagements-all/shareholders-call-on-activision-blizzard-board-to-terminate-ceo-replace-board-chair-and-lead-independent-director"&gt;issued a letter&lt;/a&gt; calling for the resignation of CEO Bobby Kotick and two long-serving members of the board of directors a day after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Kotick not only knew about numerous cases of sexual harassment at the company but worked to cover them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSJqId"&gt;“As new reporting indicates, and in contrast to past company statements, CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of many incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and gender discrimination at Activision Blizzard,” wrote the SOC Investment Group, which works on behalf of union pension funds invested in Activision Blizzard and other companies. “We, therefore, call on Mr. Kotick to resign as CEO of the company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKVXLn"&gt;The letter also calls for the retirement of Brian Kelly and Robert Morgado, two of the senior-most board members serving since the ’90s, in order to ensure the board of directors is capable of leading a top-down effort to reform the company. While the SOC represents a minuscule portion of Activision Blizzard’s total shares, the group said if its demands were not addressed, it would not support the re-election of current board members and would work to ensure other shareholders followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ehs8VW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our company faces an unprecedented workplace crisis of its own making,” writes the SOC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YU20o1"&gt;In the aftermath of the report, Activision Blizzard employees staged a walkout — their second in four months — in protest of Kotick’s alleged participation in and enabling of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;kinds of sexual harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt; that saw the company sued by the EEOC, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, and its own employees, all in 2021. After the news of the lawsuits broke in July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;Kotick repeatedly expressed commitments to change&lt;/a&gt;, saying the company would implement a “zero tolerance” policy, and he would reduce his salary to the lowest allowed by California law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyW7Vh"&gt;In addition to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-jen-oneal-mike-ybarra-equal-pay-after-resignation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on former Blizzard executive Jen Oneal’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;sudden resignation&lt;/a&gt;, stating that despite being co-president with Mike Ybarra, she was paid less than him and was only offered equal compensation after tendering her resignation. This news comes after numerous statements from Kotick stating the company was committed to pay transparency for its female employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljgSXL"&gt;In the letter sent to Activision Blizzard’s board of directors, the SOC writes, “Our company faces an unprecedented workplace crisis of its own making.” The letter also criticizes the board for being “almost entirely silent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEfyv4"&gt;Hours after the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report, Activision Blizzard’s board of directors issued a statement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;supporting Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, further angering employees and fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfWewx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A look under the hood of the most successful streaming service on the planet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qyY1QDqRBhfQxaMys8i-V5jc70=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155433/VRG_ILLO_4878_Netflix_Bitrate.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Netflix’s secret sauce is something none of us ever see&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UvHKhq"&gt;As hundreds of thousands of households worldwide tapped into Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; last month, viewers may have taken something fairly extraordinary for granted. Netflix didn’t buckle under the unprecedented demand for the dystopian drama that would become its most successful title to date — even as other services have struggled to keep their products sturdy under less demanding circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AG1wus"&gt;When many of us fire up our favorite streaming services, we often bump into various fury-making problems: stuff freezes, controls don’t work, or the service crashes entirely. None of these are ideal, but all seem to have become a widely understood cost of cord-cutting. For example, Disney Plus crashed its &lt;em&gt;very first day&lt;/em&gt; because its software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20973340/disney-plus-first-day-outages-app-amazon-bamtech-netflix"&gt;couldn’t handle&lt;/a&gt; the demand (and then it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291338/disney-plus-outage-wandavision-down-streaming-west-coast"&gt;buckled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/wandavision-crashed-disney-plus-1234707228/"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; under demand for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;). HBO Max is so fundamentally broken that its own leadership &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/hbo-max-app-crash-problem-fix.html"&gt;has admitted&lt;/a&gt; that the app is a mess. Even Instagram, whose Stories feature makes it a kind of streaming service in its own right, crashes so frequently it’s started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722118/instagram-outages-service-down-notification-explanation"&gt;alerting its users&lt;/a&gt; when it’s borked. Streaming can be maddening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLJ2hm"&gt;A service’s guts, the engineering behind the app itself, are the foundation of any streamer’s success, and Netflix has spent the last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3064182/netflix-open-connect-cdn-isp"&gt;10 years building&lt;/a&gt; out an expansive server network called Open Connect in order to avoid many modern streaming headaches. It’s the thing that’s allowed Netflix to serve up a far more reliable experience than its competitors and not falter when some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;111 million users&lt;/a&gt; tuned in to &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; during its earliest weeks on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EpTKXA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Anyone who wants to improve performance is going to try to put a server as close to the end user as possible.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aeb66e"&gt;“One of the reasons why Netflix is the leader in this market and has the number of subs they do [...] is something that pretty much everybody outside of the technical part of this industry underestimates, and that is Open Connect,” Dan Rayburn, a media streaming expert and principal analyst with Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “How many times has Netflix had a problem with their streaming service over the last 10 years?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvAZlm"&gt;Certainly not as many as HBO Max, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVwO9q"&gt;Open Connect was created because Netflix “knew that we needed to build some level of infrastructure technology that would sustain the anticipated traffic that we knew success would look like,” Gina Haspilaire, Netflix’s vice president of Open Connect, tells me. “We felt we were going to be successful, and we knew that the internet at the time was not built to sustain the level of traffic that would be required globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQBSVD"&gt;Nobody wants to sit down to watch a movie only to have their app crash or buffer for an eternity. What Netflix had the foresight to understand was that if it was going to maintain a certain level of quality, it would have to build a distribution system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="FAKm1m"&gt;Popping the hood on Open Connect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="yqb9yQ"&gt;Open Connect is Netflix’s in-house content distribution network specifically built to deliver its TV shows and movies. Started in 2012, the program involves Netflix giving internet service providers physical appliances that allow them to localize traffic. These appliances store copies of Netflix content to create less strain on networks by eliminating the number of channels that content has to pass through to reach the user trying to play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzj4oC"&gt;Most major streaming services rely on third-party content delivery networks (CDNs) to pass along their videos, which is why Netflix’s server network is so unique. Without a system like Open Connect or a third-party CDN in place, a request for content by an ISP has to “go through a peering point and maybe transit four or five other networks until it gets to the origin, or the place that holds the content,” Will Law, chief architect of media engineering at Akamai, a major content delivery network, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Not only does that slow down delivery, but it’s expensive since ISPs may have to pay to access that content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnDCPE"&gt;To avoid the traffic and fees, Netflix ships copies of its content to its own servers ahead of time. That also helps to prevent Netflix traffic from choking network demand during peak hours of streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbHnGG"&gt;“We, Open Connect, bring a copy of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt; at the closest point to your internet service provider — in some cases, right inside your internet service provider’s network — and that basically avoids the burden of the internet service provider having to go get it and transfer it through all these servers on the internet over to you,” Haspilaire tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q30ozNqAyhZ4I-KMxfNBjlrHLoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23014405/VRG_4878_Netflix_bitrate_chart.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Chart by Kristen Radtke / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9qGDJc"&gt;And they’re everywhere. At present, Netflix says it has 17,000 servers spread across 158 countries, and the company tells me it plans to continue expanding its content delivery network. Netflix prioritizes where it places these servers based on where it has the most members and relationships with ISPs, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHge9L"&gt;“Anyone who wants to improve performance is going to try to put a server as close to the end user as possible,” Law explains. “And in putting it there and by serving the content from that last mile network, it stops the traffic having to transit all the rest of the internet and go back to an origin. So it’s taking a load off the internet, and it’s taking a load off the peering points.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5UV2B"&gt;When Open Connect originally launched a decade ago, the service started working collaboratively with ISPs on deployment. Netflix provides ISPs with the servers for free, and Netflix has an internal reliability team that works with ISP resources to maintain the servers. The benefit to ISPs, according to both Netflix and Akamai, is fewer costs to ISPs by alleviating the need for them to have to fetch copies of content themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtRVSL"&gt;“It’s not a huge burden, but it’s certainly a relief,” Law tells me. “It’s the same principle that Akamai is founded on and the same principle that every CDN works on. Netflix’s CDN is no different to other CDNs — except their CDN is dedicated to Netflix content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbzS8T"&gt;While most major third-party CDNs do multiple jobs and manage multiple requests from many companies — Akamai, for example, says it has thousands of customers — Netflix’s internal CDN does exactly one job: it distributes Netflix content. If a content distributor doesn’t have this kind of CDN partnership or server network in place, Law says, there’s a whole lot of stuff that needs to happen along the way for you to stream a movie or TV show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2q2aZP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The reason that Netflix had to build a CDN is because America’s ISPs are garbage.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4a9KhE"&gt;While Netflix doesn’t disclose how much it costs the company to build and maintain these servers, Netflix says it’s invested roughly $1 billion in Open Connect since its creation a decade ago. It’s dumping mountains of money into the CDN because a premium and user-engaged streaming experience is core to Netflix’s entire business strategy. Its whole subscription model, for example, is based in part around what quality of video streaming a user wants for their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2mkSH"&gt;Netflix also has to account for America’s internet infrastructure being fundamentally &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/open-access-fiber-networks-will-bring-much-needed-high-speed-internet-service-and"&gt;fractured&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYjKSu"&gt;“The reason that Netflix had to build a CDN is because America’s ISPs are garbage,” Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Katharine Trendacosta tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And what they knew was that their customers don’t want an endlessly buffering screen or degraded quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neBQMs"&gt;Now, not every ISP allows Netflix’s hardware in. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with an AT&amp;amp;T executive who confirmed that it still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/29/5949615/netflix-now-paying-att-to-improve-streaming-quality"&gt;sells Netflix optimal network connections&lt;/a&gt; to the streamer rather than having Netflix install physical devices in its data centers. When asked about how this arrangement and others work alongside its Open Connect program, Netflix said that it views “our relationships with ISPs globally as adaptable.” A company spokesperson said the arrangement may differ based on what an ISP’s network supports, and Netflix will find other connection points to bring its titles closer to the viewer instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Zf3LSB"&gt;Why it works&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="7WQ9KS"&gt;The thing that Netflix is most concerned with is delivering a good viewing experience regardless of how bad your ISP is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbuqkL"&gt;To do that, Netflix effectively ships three copies of each of its titles to its servers, each with a different level of quality. If your ISP is overwhelmed or your internet momentarily kicks out, the system can swap in a lower-bitrate version of the title, helping you maintain the stream without interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFVCfr"&gt;“We will adapt the content to the quality of the network and not vice versa,” Haspilaire says. “That’s the reason why you don’t see when your network has a blip — your streaming stays constant. Because over time, we’re able to adjust the version … so when your internet goes in and out, you won’t get buffering from us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDeGWM"&gt;So, why three copies? As Trendacosta noted, the internet as we experience it is entirely unreliable. Outages, poor wifi connections, and any other network interruptions might impact your ability to access the internet the way you need to. Netflix can work around many of these network problems through its collaboration with ISPs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4ygv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nobody is going to disagree or argue with Netflix that they’ve built a system that works at scale.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCTN3v"&gt;Haspilaire says Netflix pre-places this content during off-peak hours so it’s not competing with other internet traffic that would occur during high-use streaming times. As far as what content it places and where, Netflix says it anticipates what’s going to be popular and sends its content to servers accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHCi3Q"&gt;“Not only are we placing content on all of these servers around the world, but we are pre-placing them based on what is popular. Because we predict what is popular, we’re able to put it as close as possible under the correct server,” Haspilaire says. “This pre-placement of our films and shows allows us, based on prime time viewing hours, to store 100 percent of our catalog locally. And that basically eliminates the whole risk associated with service disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCjxFd"&gt;Netflix then shuffles the videos around its servers based on what it expects to get the most attention. Open Connect has two types of servers: flash, which handles faster delivery, and storage, which holds up to 350 TB of data. If something sitting in storage becomes popular, Netflix will move that title onto the flash server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvlLhw"&gt;“The flash server is designed to serve a larger portion of the traffic, so as demand increases for a show or film, our OCA is built to be dynamic by transitioning it from storage to flash to meet that demand,” the company tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TL0h0R"&gt;Hundreds of millions of people huddling in their homes and looking for entertaining distractions was a perfect litmus test for this 10-year-old project. “The pandemic really kind of tested our infrastructure, or our technology, in such a way that it was not built for,” Haspilaire says. Open Connect helped future-proof Netflix against that increased demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="TCcJ4H"&gt;King of streaming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="iCk7lW"&gt;Open Connect is one of the biggest behind-the-scenes drivers behind Netflix’s ability to perform as well as it did during the pandemic. But there’s a lot of other moving parts that put Netflix far ahead of its competitors. Rayburn points to Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://research.netflix.com/research-area/video-encoding-and-quality"&gt;video and audio encoding&lt;/a&gt; initiatives as one such example, though its user experience is another big one. Even if Netflix had a “huge advantage,” as Rayburn says, over competitors with its decade-long lead, you’ve got to have a rock-solid product to grow and retain a subscriber base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fU4dbG"&gt;“Nobody is going to disagree or argue with Netflix that they’ve built a system that works at scale, and that is the biggest thing that is missed in our industry,” Rayburn says. “You only get that number of subs if you can deliver good, quality consumer experience at scale. Nobody’s ever had the scale to the degree Netflix has. Nobody has that expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkHeRu"&gt;In other words, users have to actually enjoy the stuff that’s built &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; Netflix’s infrastructure, as well. Beyond just ensuring that streams don’t crash and burn, the consideration that goes into the development of Netflix’s various features are often overlooked simply because we don’t have to think about them — they just work. But Netflix is constantly working on improving its UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWv94r"&gt;“We don’t make an assumption that one size fits all. When you think about design, we could just design the product for the western audience, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it works in Korea or Japan,” says Steve Johnson, Netflix’s vice president of product and studio design. “So we have to think about the nuances and the particulars that happen in those different countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dRhURH"&gt;As other services continue to grow, it’s possible and even likely that major streamers will be looking to Netflix’s infrastructure and top-to-bottom business strategy for guidance. With any luck, maybe that’ll even fix the universal nightmare of streaming content virtually anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Fire TV Omni review: useful Alexa features, underwhelming picture</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s first TV has an appealing price and useful features but isn’t on par where it counts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="omGKal"&gt;You’d expect a lot from Amazon’s first self-branded TVs. After building a successful hardware business with its Echo smart devices and Fire TV streaming gadgets, now the tech giant wants to put its name on the biggest screen in your home. The new Fire TV Omni series delivers 4K HDR picture in multiple sizes that start at aggressively low prices: the 50-inch model costs $359.99 at the time of this review. Only the largest 65-inch and 75-inch models include Dolby Vision HDR, which, in Amazon’s own words, allows for “a more cinematic experience.” All of the Omni TVs run Amazon’s Fire TV software and have built-in mics for hands-free Alexa voice commands — even when the screen is off. There’s also a cheaper Fire TV 4-Series on sale now, but I’m reviewing the higher-end series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3svgoD"&gt;In some ways, Amazon’s new effort shows big promise. The Alexa integration is more thorough and full-featured than what you’d get using a Fire TV stick: in addition to launching your favorite streaming apps or searching for content with your voice, you can also switch between TV inputs. And you can query Alexa when the TV’s display is fully off for simple information like the weather or to play music. The Omni also supports features like Apple AirPlay 2, which Amazon’s streaming players still do not, and you can plug a webcam into the TV’s USB port for video calls with Echo Show devices right now and Zoom and other apps later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIAzGy"&gt;But Amazon’s first TVs underwhelm in the all-important area of picture quality, and they rank below competition from TCL, Vizio, Hisense, and other TV makers that play in the same price range. There’s nothing inherently terrible about the viewing experience on the Fire TV Omni. If you’re someone who’s easy to please, you might be totally satisfied. But Amazon has made a few too many hardware compromises for me to recommend its new TV lineup to people who want the best picture for their money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E3Uhjr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10870833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gv9wmv"&gt;Before going further, I have to note that while Amazon claims these are “Amazon-built TVs,” they are almost certainly being manufactured by TCL. There are unmistakable hardware similarities between them, from the general overall design to the I/O port layout. I’m sure Amazon had some input into the final product (especially with regards to the Alexa integration), but there’s no denying who the company contracted to produce these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OKsZPqyitG_NLk5qXf9Eo_Ejs4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019535/DSCF6068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A blue LED illuminates when the mic is activated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="By62gG"&gt;The 55-inch model I tested has black bezels, though there’s a slimmer silver trim on the 65-inch and 75-inch Dolby Vision sizes. Centered below the bottom bezel is an LED indicator for the far-field microphone array: a blue light illuminates when the “Alexa” wake word is detected (and you’ll see the familiar long blue line across the lower portion of the TV screen). If you’re not a fan of your TV having built-in microphones, you can disable them by flipping a switch that’s on the TV’s underside. A red light indicates that the mics have been turned off, and you’re still free to use voice commands with the Alexa Voice Remote in this scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmwoK_FrfphqXda6T5eW1Rc727g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019537/DSCF6073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A red LED indicates that the TV’s microphones are disabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWFVMq"&gt;As for port selection, the Omni includes three HDMI 2.0 ports and a single HDMI 2.1 eARC port that can take advantage of the latest and greatest soundbars. There’s also cable / antenna input, ethernet, a USB 2.0 port, optical audio out, a headphone jack, and a port for the IR emitter that Amazon also includes in the box. That IR emitter can be used to control your other home theater gear and gives the Omni some very rudimentary universal remote capabilities, much like the Fire TV Cube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2t9Dc"&gt;Similar to existing “Fire TV Edition” TVs from Toshiba and Insignia, Amazon’s Omni TVs run the company’s Fire TV software with a few extra tweaks for TV inputs, picture settings, and so on. But general navigation, browsing content, and streaming all feel the same here as on a Fire TV Stick 4K. All of the major streaming apps you’d want are accounted for, even if the interface continues to put a bigger emphasis on Prime Video content than anything else. In most cases, Alexa’s responses were identical to those I’ve received on a Fire TV streaming device. You’re not really gaining any major new functionality with the Omni, but assuming you don’t have an Echo speaker in the same room, it’s nice being able to ask for the basics (like turning off a nearby smart bulb) with the screen off. Another potential benefit of going with this TV is that you’ll receive new software updates long into the future, though the same can be said for Roku TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ih0Pl_XE9agttKfCq6vjs-UpFfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019552/DSCF6090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Omni has three HDMI 2.0 ports and one HDMI 2.1 eARC port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFUGoI64nd8I0pGFQvjCv-Dxg5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019543/DSCF6084.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get the standard Alexa Voice Remote in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocm0rs"&gt;It’s when you start watching movies and TV shows on the Fire TV Omni that it becomes clear Amazon settled for average picture quality. These TVs use a direct LED backlight and lack any kind of local dimming that can produce deeper black levels by illuminating and dimming “zones” of the screen as necessary. So the contrast on Amazon’s TV falls short of what you’d find on something like TCL’s 5-Series or Vizio’s M-Series. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s noticeable. I’m disappointed that Amazon went such a basic route — particularly on the larger screen sizes — and picture quality suffers for it. Black levels aside, I’ve found general HDR10 performance across several movies to be respectable for the price range of this 55-inch model, though &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX7QTtAKoKE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Trends&lt;/em&gt; was disappointed&lt;/a&gt; by the maximum HDR brightness levels on the Dolby Vision-capable Omni. This is another area where it’s evident that Amazon isn’t trying to outshine the competition and instead settling for “passable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="rGPuhe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10870593"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qi15b8"&gt;You aren’t going to be gaming at 120Hz with your PS5 or Xbox Series X on the Fire TV Omni: this is a 60Hz panel, and it also lacks variable refresh rate. But there’s at least support for auto low latency mode (ALLM), and Amazon fares impressively well at cutting down input lag when gaming mode is active. It’ll work for gaming but definitely doesn’t check every box that new console owners are looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z7WX8-k38OAmF7cnpiYlrXJeddE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019545/DSCF6063.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the 65-inch and 75-inch models include Dolby Vision HDR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ISkY8"&gt;At review time, there are still several features of the Fire TV Omni listed as “coming soon,” such as the aforementioned AirPlay 2 support and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GYYMWGZJUK28FEN6/&amp;amp;ref_=alxhb_mrma_text_pairechotv"&gt;use Echo speakers for home theater sound&lt;/a&gt;. A native Zoom app has also yet to appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjjoyA"&gt;My overall takeaway after testing the Fire TV Omni is that it’s an attractively priced 4K TV with convenient voice controls — but only so-so picture quality. Amazon really needs to do better at that criteria next time around. You can buy a TCL 6-Series Roku TV with fantastic picture quality for not much more. Google TV runs on gorgeous Sony OLEDs and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;now a high-end TCL TV with Mini LED&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately for Amazon, the Fire TV Omni’s viewing experience doesn’t really come close to any of those. At the end of the day, you’re better off choosing a TV with better picture quality and throwing in a Fire TV Stick 4K Max if you prefer Amazon’s streaming platform. But while this might be an underwhelming first attempt at “the Amazon TV” for nerds like myself, I wouldn’t count Amazon out. The prices alone might be enough to sell some people on the Fire TV Omni. And if the company can maintain similar prices and dial up the picture quality of its eventual second-gen TVs, the whole concept will be all the more appealing. If there’s one thing we know about Amazon hardware, it’s that the company is willing to improve it, and quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to delete your Instagram account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KRVrxN_dx5jL4JDmZSptwcOqTs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155416/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PU0Ji4"&gt;If you’ve made the decision to delete Instagram, whether because you’ve outgrown the need for a certain finsta or because its parent company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773038/meta-detailed-targeting-ads-facebook-instagram-messenger"&gt;Meta is courting controversy again&lt;/a&gt;, doing so isn’t as quick or easy as it should be. It can’t even be done from within the Instagram app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rsf6a1"&gt;Go ahead and take a moment to make an obligatory “I’m deleting Instagram” post if you'd like, and then follow these steps to ditch your account — they can be followed using either a computer or phone, as long as you’re using a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="gvs2T0"&gt;First, you’ll have to go to Instagram’s special account removal request page, &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/permanent/"&gt;which can be found here&lt;/a&gt;, or by following the link in Instagram’s &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242/"&gt;account deletion help article&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not logged into Instagram for the web (most people won’t be), you’ll have to enter your credentials. In fact, it’s very likely you’ll have to put in your password twice throughout the deletion process, so now’s probably a good time to make sure you know what it is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uh9c-B37qHQe67LtRBNDZr1XaIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021933/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_08.29.28.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram will clearly show you what account you’re about to delete, and ask you why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zM0tgA"&gt;You should end up on a page with the old Instagram logo and a dropdown asking you why you want to delete your account. Depending on which option you choose, you may be shown various links to Instagram’s help center promising to fix your issues or a message helpfully reminding you to check which account you’re deleting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NmkzRk"&gt;Whichever you pick, there’ll be a box below the links that asks you to reenter your password. After you do, tap or click the button that says “Delete (your account name),” and confirm that you’re sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XgRtnT6Doz5Bz_o0BuV0wIIHOV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021908/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_08.29.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapping the delete button after entering your password will give you one last confirmation pop-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Mvlqk"&gt;As Instagram says a few times on the account deletion page, your data won’t be immediately erased — Meta will keep it around for 30 days. But your profile and posts will be hidden on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KTPKH"&gt;If you’re completely breaking up with Instagram, don’t forget to remove the app from your phone as well. Doing so will save you a little space and will also put a little bit of friction between you and signing back up for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M73fM8"&gt;How to un-delete your Instagram account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jSovZG"&gt;Be aware that you won’t be able to bring your account back if it’s been over 30 days since you asked Instagram to delete it. You’ll have to recreate your account (your username will be freed up after your account’s deleted, but it’s possible someone could’ve taken it).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJMjMbjXaV2KREIEB_LNHpZIXYY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021936/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_08.34.26.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can restore your account within 30 days by logging back in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X7znk6"&gt;However, if you’re within that 30-day time period, you can get your account back, along with its posts and DMs. To do so, simply go back to Instagram and log in with your credentials. You’ll see a message saying that you requested your account be deleted, along with the date your data will be gone. To keep that from happening, just press the “Keep Account” button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GXkBWc"&gt;Temporarily suspending your Instagram account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5K7FJt"&gt;If you want to remove your account from public view, but don’t want to permanently delete all your photos and messages, you can suspend your account instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqzlKmWmRn0El9bl-HzDsx-jnJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021984/IG_Suspend_Account.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen to suspend your account is relatively easy to access, but you’ll have to do it through a web browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EVZr6c"&gt;Again, Meta makes you use the web version of Instagram, instead of the app, but at least you won’t have to get a link from a help article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wXlcLh"&gt;After logging into Instagram.com, go to your profile and click the Edit Profile button (if you’re using a mobile browser, you’ll have to tap the settings cog to get the option).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EaspiW"&gt;From there, go to “Edit Profile” &amp;gt; “Temporarily disable my account” (it’ll be an option at the very bottom). As with deleting your account, you’ll have to select a reason why you’re suspending your account, and put in your password. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZtuYJFC0UDwGIfrCizFESpAmIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021966/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_08.40.08.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram’s “Temporarily disable account” screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mKFdXV"&gt;To re-enable your account, simply log back in using the app or the website. You’ll only be able to suspend your account once a week, so if you accidentally log back in your profile, your posts will be back online and visible to followers, at least for a little while. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KMFRg2"&gt;Each and every day we get closer to Black Friday, the deals keep heating up. There are already a lot of great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday sales&lt;/a&gt; to pore over, and we’ve even gathered retailer-specific deals from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has its own deals going on, in a way, with exclusives offered below, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"&gt;our very own giveaway&lt;/a&gt;. It’s certainly the season of tech deals, and kicking off today’s sales are discounts on the hottest laptops that just hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WrhUs"&gt;When Apple announced its new MacBook Pro laptops, its own site broke under the weight of people placing orders. But not only can you get one now, you can save a little off the total. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is up to $100 off at B&amp;amp;H Photo. You can get a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1668197-REG%2Fapple_mkgp3ll_a_14_2_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F17%2F22786028%2Fapple-macbook-pro-14-1password-august-smart-home-lock-airtag-final-fantasy-ps5-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;14-inch MacBook Pro with an eight-core M1 Pro processor with 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM for $1,949&lt;/a&gt; (usually $1,999). B&amp;amp;H knocked $100 off of this model as of this morning, so that promo could return soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xg8xem"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="ZLfNwo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10870608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DIKlKO"&gt;If you crave a bit more power under the hood, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1668198-REG%2Fapple_mkgq3ll_a_14_2_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F17%2F22786028%2Fapple-macbook-pro-14-1password-august-smart-home-lock-airtag-final-fantasy-ps5-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H also has $100 off the 10-core M1 Pro-equipped 14-inch MacBook Pro, costing $2,400&lt;/a&gt;. That bumped-up version comes with a 16-core GPU and 1TB of storage. These offers end on November 19th, and B&amp;amp;H notes that supply is limited at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uleNGG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10870602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5SPjIi"&gt;These laptops are hard to come by at retailers, and discounts on them may prove few and far between. The pent-up demand for a new MacBook Pro that answers the yearslong demands for more ports and power has even led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/24/22743137/apple-estimated-ship-times-preorders-new-macbook-pro-december-m1"&gt;shipping delays on some models&lt;/a&gt;. It’s all for good reason, as the new Pro laptops got very high marks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt; and are the ideal computers for creators and creative professionals who want a machine that’s up to the task. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5tiRo"&gt;Securing your data and personal logins can be especially important this time of year while doing tons of online shopping, and a password manager can help immensely. 1Password is offering a special promotion just for readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;New customers can enjoy 50 percent off a 1Password &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge14InchMacDealRoundup111721/https://start.1password.com/sign-up?" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge14InchMacDealRoundup111721/https://start.1password.com/sign-up/family" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;family plan&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to automatically create secure passwords across all the accounts you use. Individual and family plans normally run $36 and $60 per year, respectively. With this offer, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can help protect their data and accounts for just &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge14InchMacDealRoundup111721/https://start.1password.com/sign-up" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$18 on an individual plan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge14InchMacDealRoundup111721/https://start.1password.com/sign-up/family" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$30 on a family plan&lt;/a&gt;. This promo runs until December 6th. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="qqVhIe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10437502"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zG7c5h"&gt;
&lt;p id="kZOAOt"&gt;While on the topic of security, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Faugust%2Dsmart%2Dlock%2Dwi%2Dfi%2D4th%2Dgen&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDailyDeal111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers $50 off an August Smart Lock Wi-Fi (fourth-generation)&lt;/a&gt; when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELOCK&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This is the latest smart lock from August that is compatible with the deadbolt you already have on your door. Normally $229, this exclusive deal from Wellbots saves you 22 percent for a total price of $179 — and you can pick between the black or gray finishes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255026/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DXttKz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9758101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86d58l"&gt;Apple’s AirTags are a handy little location tracker for iPhone users. They’re helpful for keeping track of your bag, keys, or even a wallet or purse. With a waterproof design and user-replaceable battery, they should last you a long time. Woot has an exceptional price on a four-pack of AirTags. If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/Verge14InchMacDealRoundup111721/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airtag-4pk-8" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get a four-pack of AirTags from Woot for just $88&lt;/a&gt;. That is the lowest price around. Not an Amazon Prime subscriber? You can still nab the deal from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airtag-4pk-8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F17%2F22786028%2Fapple-macbook-pro-14-1password-august-smart-home-lock-airtag-final-fantasy-ps5-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $93&lt;/a&gt; (normally $100). This offer is limited to one per customer and valid until November 30th or while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeYVMF"&gt;While location trackers from Tile are available with support for more devices at a lower price, they don’t have the same level of tight integration with iOS and the Find My app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="a8dPAu"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BtJ7PM"&gt;More deals worthy of your attention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yMy570"&gt;If you skipped out on &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; last year, now might be a great time to get into it. Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XNRM6QN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 version of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; — complete with the Yuffie DLC — for just $45&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re still rocking the PS4 until you can get your hands on the newer console, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZS80PC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS4 copy is just $25 and gets a free upgrade to the PS5 version&lt;/a&gt;. Just take note that if you go the PS4 upgrade path, you have to buy the DLC separately, but you’ll only end up spending the same $45 total as &lt;em&gt;Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; costs right now. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bdfd2P"&gt;B&amp;amp;H has great daily deal prices on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FdealZone.jsp%3Fsku%3D1505217-REG&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F17%2F22786028%2Fapple-macbook-pro-14-1password-august-smart-home-lock-airtag-final-fantasy-ps5-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a selection of Manfrotto camera backpacks&lt;/a&gt; for today only.

    <title>Xbox Cloud Gaming is starting to roll out to Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_K1nP0kSo5lMYMv1yAmdtcSbFiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155216/vpavic_201103_4275_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ra85oY"&gt;Microsoft is beginning to roll out the ability to play games via Xbox Cloud Gaming on Xbox One or Xbox Series X / S consoles, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/17/xbox-cloud-gaming-launches-on-console/?ocid=Updates_soc_omc_xbo__Video_lrn_11.17.1"&gt;Microsoft announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The feature requires a Game Pass Ultimate subscription and will be available in 25 regions “with Brazil coming soon,” according to Microsoft. But you might not have access to the feature right away, as Microsoft says it will roll out first “with our November release to a subset of Xbox gamers” and to everyone in supported markets “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2AQFN"&gt;Cloud gaming on Xbox consoles could have a number of useful applications. You can use it to try or demo games available on Game Pass without having to fully download them. If a friend sends you a multiplayer invite for a game you don’t have installed, Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you stream the game so you can jump right in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JqTr5n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Play Xbox Series X / S games on your Xbox One&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3uvrv"&gt;And if you have an Xbox One, Xbox Cloud Gaming will actually let you play some next-gen exclusive games like like &lt;em&gt;Recompile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Medium&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Riftbreaker&lt;/em&gt; on your last-gen console&lt;em&gt;. Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; isn’t available yet, but Microsoft says it will be added to its cloud game library in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7A2YT"&gt;Xbox Cloud Gaming (formerly Project xCloud) arrived on iOS and PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;in an invite-only beta in April&lt;/a&gt; before a wider expansion to all Game Pass Ultimate subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt;. Xbox Cloud Gaming integration on consoles first rolled out to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698101/microsoft-xcloud-xbox-cloud-gaming-console-integration"&gt;Xbox Insiders in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V7Zkh"&gt;The news of Xbox Cloud Gaming on consoles arrives during a busy week for Microsoft. On Monday, the company surprise-launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, added 76 new games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782746/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatibility-76-new-games"&gt;to its backward compatibility library&lt;/a&gt;, and brought FPS Boost to some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782755/microsoft-xbox-fps-boost-mode-37-new-games"&gt;Cloud Gaming titles&lt;/a&gt; and more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782755/microsoft-xbox-fps-boost-mode-37-new-games"&gt;Xbox Series X / S titles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon charges $5 per month to make calls from Alexa using your mobile number</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aF3EPDuYbER4xsF-Y2ECFaRFdHs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155212/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvIeDE"&gt;Verizon’s new Number Share Home plan gives you the ability you make and receive calls from your Echo Show, Echo Dot, and Echo using your existing phone number, as noted in a post on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-introduces-hands-free-calling-alexa-home" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GKqGOs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Alexa, call Keith.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing Number Share - Home, a new feature that allows &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Verizon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Verizon&lt;/a&gt; customers to make and receive hands-free audio calls through their supported Amazon Alexa-enabled devices. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexa99?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@alexa99&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@amazonnews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/S3bfgHJskP"&gt;https://t.co/S3bfgHJskP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon News (@VerizonNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonNews/status/1460630466063654917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4lRA0K"&gt;The feature costs an extra $5 / month, but Verizon will waive the fee for three months if you purchase an Alexa-enabled device through them. And if you already have an Alexa device that you’d like to use, Verizon will only give you one month for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8c3e5t"&gt;Once enabled, you make hands-free calls in the same way that you’re probably already familiar with. Say, “Alexa, call [name],” or “Alexa, dial [phone number]” to make a call, and then say, “Alexa, answer,” when a call comes in. You can also use your device to contact emergency services with the “Alexa, dial 911” command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwztGG"&gt;When you place a call through your Echo device, your Verizon phone number will display on the recipient’s caller ID. Verizon also notes that you can switch between your Alexa device and a “Verizon-distributed Android mobile phone” during calls, but it remains unclear how to do so, as well as which devices that specific feature is available on. From the phrasing Verizon uses, it appears as if live call swapping excludes iPhones, as well as Androids not purchased through Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5ooyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon’s Number Share plan lets you make as many calls from your Echo device as your mobile plan allows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIS94u"&gt;If you’re interested in setting up the service, you can connect your Verizon number with your Alexa account by opening the Alexa app and hitting “More.” Then, select “Settings” followed by “Communication.” From here, tap “Verizon,” and then follow the steps outlined on the screen. Amazon offers more details about the service &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23680112011"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZpLjW"&gt;Echo devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/29/16387398/amazon-echo-free-voice-calls-us-canada-mexico"&gt;already give you the ability to make free calls&lt;/a&gt; through its Alexa Communication feature, but it can be sort of limiting. While Alexa-enabled devices support unlimited phone calls to other Alexa Communication users, it only lets you call up to 10 phone numbers in the US, UK, Mexico, and Canada (excluding 911). Plus, you can’t receive incoming calls from regular phone numbers — it only supports inbound calls from other Alexa users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWm9aH"&gt;Verizon’s Number Share Home plan lets you make as many calls from your Echo device as your mobile plan allows, and it lets you receive calls from anyone. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428700/amazon-att-phone-number-calls-alexa-link-feature-smart-home-echo"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T rolled out a similar partnership with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as an extension of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428700/amazon-att-phone-number-calls-alexa-link-feature-smart-home-echo"&gt;NumberSync program&lt;/a&gt;. This lets you make and receive calls from your AT&amp;amp;T number on Alexa-enabled devices, as well as from your iPad, Mac, and smartwatch. And unlike Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T’s NumberSync doesn’t tack an extra charge on top of your existing phone bill (aside from any data charges that you may rack up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MmiN5"&gt;Verizon offers a separate plan to share your mobile number with any non-Alexa devices, called &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/numbershare-faqs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Number Share Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438693/verizon-apple-watch-carrier-plan-lower-monthly-cost-price"&gt;make and receive calls from your smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18054516/palm-smartphone-lifemode-phone-numbers-verizon-message-plus"&gt;Palm device&lt;/a&gt; at an added cost of $10 / month. Combining both of Verizon’s unbundled Number Share plans means you’ll be paying an extra $15 / month, which is more than you’d be paying on AT&amp;amp;T. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Verizon about the possibility of a bundled Number Share plan in the future but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Miramax sues Quentin Tarantino over Pulp Fiction NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image reading TARANTINO NFTs, with a picture of John Travolta and Samuel Jackson from Pulp Fiction" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0zjZtkRfsKSua-YHfd4dTiYO3Yg=/142x0:2146x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70155134/Screen_Shot_2021_11_17_at_11.30.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tarantino NFTs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nxVBh0"&gt;Production company Miramax has sued director Quentin Tarantino over his non-fungible token or &lt;a href="https://tarantinonfts.com/"&gt;NFT collection&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21111461-miramax-tarantino-nft/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, filed yesterday in California court and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarkJKings/status/1460787218738339848"&gt;noted online&lt;/a&gt; by attorney Mark Jaffe, says NFTs don’t fall under Tarantino’s reserved rights for the film. Miramax accuses him of violating the company’s copyright and trademark, and it’s demanding a halt to the upcoming sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vg7BlN"&gt;Tarantino’s NFT collection is supposed to include blockchain tokens associated with high-resolution scans from his original handwritten screenplay of &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, plus a drawing inspired by some element of the scene. But Miramax alleges that Tarantino’s limited contractual rights for &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; — including interactive games, live performances, and other ancillary media — don’t cover NFTs linked with the film’s screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5JvA3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tarantino’s conduct may mislead other creators into believing they have the right to exploit Miramax films through NFTs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p4Miwx"&gt;Among other things, Miramax objects to Tarantino using &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; branding and imagery, saying that it’s likely to confuse buyers into thinking the NFTs are official Miramax products. And it says that while Tarantino has the right to “publish” pieces of the screenplay, NFTs don’t fall under that umbrella. “The proposed sale of a few original script pages or scenes as an NFT is a one-time transaction, which does not constitute publication,” the lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyu2Zd"&gt;The bigger issue isn’t Tarantino’s NFT lineup, specifically, but the precedent it could set for other filmmakers. “Tarantino’s conduct may mislead other creators into believing they have the right to exploit Miramax films through NFTs and other emerging technologies, when in fact Miramax holds those rights for its films.” Major film companies have released their own NFT collections for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574752/niftys-nft-space-jam-lebron-james-warner-looney-tunes"&gt;movies like &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so that’s not an abstract concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuDwTC"&gt;While this isn’t the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543753/jay-z-nft-lawsuit-reasonable-doubt-roc-a-fella-damon-dash"&gt;NFT-related lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the first legal tests of what an NFT actually &lt;em&gt;is — &lt;/em&gt;or at the very least, whether it’s comparable to any of the options Tarantino reserved. Miramax claims his rights include a static set of exceptions that “do not encompass any rights or media that were not known at the time of the original rights agreement,” while its own rights are “broad” and “catch-all.” By contrast, in a response to a cease and desist letter, Tarantino alleged that he’s basically publishing sections of a screenplay with additional embellishments like the drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QL8GM"&gt;NFTs are a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;frequently baffling&lt;/a&gt; but highly lucrative technology that’s provided an alternate revenue stream for people to profit off media &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22399790/emily-ratajkowski-nft-christies-copyright-nightmare-richard-prince"&gt;outside traditional licensing deals&lt;/a&gt;. Tarantino’s NFTs are supposed to add a layer of “privacy and access control features” that will hide previously unknown secrets about his work — apparently inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nftdegenerates/video/7029741994981313797?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8i3AVqarZLKNe0h67HAxjMsZqBO3YZC9DBNzX3Sm%2Fz56TYh7jRKKF1ix%2Fs%2B9poztR3fhSO5%2BHOhDWgXNQGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=7029741994981313797&amp;amp;share_link_id=6C903C47-4607-4A72-BC37-8C6DA49708DD&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1637116437&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dl4ib4b426a8ma&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"&gt;a description of NFTs&lt;/a&gt; as having hidden “matrix code” inside of them.&lt;/p&gt;
