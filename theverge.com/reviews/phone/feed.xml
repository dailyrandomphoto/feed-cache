    <title>Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW review: tough choices</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The DuraSport 5G is one of the few rugged options available&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XH6g5P"&gt;After releasing the tank-like $899.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446490/kyocera-duraforce-ultra-5g-uw-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;DuraForce Ultra 5G UW in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Kyocera is back with a more subtly rugged (and more affordable) phone — the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW. If you want a sub-$600 rugged phone that works on Verizon’s millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G network, the DuraSport 5G UW is really your only choice. Roughly the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A with 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the DuraSport is small but strong: it’s dust, sand, and waterproof in up to 6.5 ft of water for 30 minutes (IP68), as well as MIL 810H-certified to survive five-foot drops onto concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fyRyM"&gt;Underneath that toughness, the DuraSport is a sub-$300 phone at heart. It shares similar specs as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;: they both use the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. But the DuraSport has a smaller 4,500mAh battery and comes with some unique outdoor apps and camera features. This leads to the obvious question: is a budget rugged phone worth the premium, or are you better off getting a cheap 5G phone and adding a very protective case around it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQRyhj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irpu2G5AQ1fM2aqWOGvUvsuIYeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100512/gsin_190401_4934_0001_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FceIkL"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="87ab7q"&gt;At a time when every new budget phone seems to be over 6.5 inches tall, the DuraSport is surprisingly compact. It’s similar to the Google Pixel 5A with 5G but thicker and slightly more narrow (6.09 x 2.78 x 0.39-inch or 154.7 x 70.7 x 9.9mm). They even look alike, with the same rounded corners and fingerprint sensor on the back — handy for unlocking the phone when you’re wearing a mask. This phone fits nicely in my small hands, and I can stuff it into most pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6x0Q5"&gt;For a phone built to survive the rigorous military-grade tests for dust, sand, water, and drop protection, the DuraSport’s design doesn’t scream rugged. Unlike its more expensive sibling, the DuraSport has normal dimensions and proportions. But it still obviates the need for a separate case: not only is its screen protected by Gorilla Glass 6, but it has reinforced corners, water-tight seams around its buttons, and a Dragontrail Glass over its rear cameras. Despite its extra bits of engineering, the Kyocera weighs about the same as the Pixel 5A. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szgt5xhgFStySime-UT16E5-eCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100514/gsin_190401_4934_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport has some texture on its sides to help with grip, but it’s not very comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9A00JY"&gt;While the DuraSport’s hard plastic shell can withstand a lot of abuse, it’s not the most comfortable to hold. Kyocera added some light texture to its back cover and along the sides, but they don’t provide much substantial grip to the device. Not that this phone needs the extra protection, but a case would make the phone easier to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwU83e"&gt;Among the many ways you can customize this phone, the most obvious is the programmable button on the left side. You can set it to open the exact camera mode you need in a hurry (underwater shutter button) or open a particular app if you double-press the button. I kept hitting the programmable button by accident because that’s where my thumb lands when I hold the phone; the actual power button is a bit too low for my liking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goH2npYLIBiyfmDpLl-sLeG10_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100518/gsin_190401_4934_0012_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included suite of outdoor apps can provide useful information, but they require constant access to your location, even when you’re not using them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FSjlj"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8pyQG8"&gt;Despite its mid-range price tag, the DuraSport has low-end internal components. Its processor is the budget-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 with 4GB of RAM, which makes the DuraSport just a beat slower to open a webpage or switch between portrait and landscape mode when watching a YouTube video. This was particularly evident when playing a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, where the middle of a battle slowed to such a crawl that I couldn’t move my Pokémon out of the way to dodge an attack. While a sub-$300 phone can get away with just 64GB of storage, it’s mismatched to the DuraSport’s nearly $600 price tag, even if it has a microSD card slot for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGZaCB"&gt;The DuraSport somewhat redeems itself with a 6.1-inch 1080p IPS LCD display that is quite bright (500 nits), making it possible to use the screen at just 60 percent brightness in direct sunlight. When you look at high-res photos like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22829680/2021-art-illustrations-photography-verge-roundup"&gt;The Verge’s 2021: A Year in Art&lt;/a&gt;, the images look smooth and detailed even when you pixel-peep, thanks to this screen’s over 400PPI pixel density. Best of all, the touchscreen is functional when I’m wearing gloves or there is water on the screen, which is a huge help during winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnFy7I"&gt;This phone is preloaded with apps for outdoor enthusiasts: an Outdoor Portal, Compass, Barometer, Sun&amp;amp;Moon, Weather, Tide (if you fish or have a boat), and Solunar (if you want to meet or avoid certain animals). In my case, I skate on an outdoor rink in the winter but am extremely picky about when I do so: the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees or below the night before and throughout the day, with minimal wind, and after sunset so the ice has a chance to harden. I used the Outdoor Portal to monitor my local weather and sunset / sunrise data rather than cycle between multiple apps. While I appreciate the convenience of having these apps on my phone, I was not impressed that I had to give the apps non-stop access to my location, even though they said I could just limit the data collection to when I use the apps. If you don’t care to use these apps at all, you don’t have to worry about the location tracking, but they are a big part of the DuraSport’s selling points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Za_0PTHZr5E8GrE4FGg5EUTFO3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100513/gsin_190401_4934_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included outdoor apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WugW9L"&gt;Beyond these outdoor apps, the DuraSport essentially runs an unmodified version of Android 11. As one of the phones selected for the &lt;a href="https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/device/#!/Atw0zjuq92nTHyfuwwaC"&gt;Android Enterprise Recommended&lt;/a&gt; program, Kyocera is already committed to providing quarterly security updates to the DuraSport until November 2023. This, along with the fact Kyocera provides two years of warranty, compared to the industry standard of just one year, means this phone should last you a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLv26q"&gt;The DuraSport’s 4,500mAh battery is actually quite energy-efficient and able to go without a charge after two days of use — and that’s from using mostly 4G LTE. After listening to a couple of hour-long podcasts, taking some photos and videos, posting and scrolling through social media, and reading various articles, I got about 15.5 hours of screen time out of the DuraSport over two days. Using the included charger, I was able to recharge the phone within 2.5 hours, which isn’t particularly fast. Kyocera says the DuraSport supports faster charging, but a fast charger is not included in the box. Like the DuraSport Ultra 5G, the lower tier model also supports wireless charging for more convenient topping up.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ge9x8YJkswhw_6oWgX2d-TQLTtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100516/gsin_190401_4934_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport’s camera is budget-level, despite its mid-range price tag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GcaNqZ"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NdYqvf"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re serious about photography, then you won’t like the cameras on the DuraSport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwh9GB"&gt;The phone has two cameras on the back, a 48-megapixel main and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, as well as an 8-megapixel front camera. The cameras take perfectly fine photos in good lighting conditions, but they’re not designed for anything challenging like low-light or action photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="14riyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10988512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NP3CMo"&gt;Its cameras share the same problems that plague other sub-$300 phones. Not only do the colors differ between the main and ultrawide camera, but the main camera also sometimes has trouble focusing and separating the subject from the background in portrait mode. I’ve also noticed that photos from low-light environments look as if there is vignetting around the edges — whether they were captured with the main, ultrawide, or selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyd2wN"&gt;The DuraSport tries to make up for its technical deficiencies with some unique video interfaces like the Action Overlay and beauty filters. (I did not have access to ANT Plus compatible fitness sensors, so I could not test the Action Overlay being linked to my fitness data in real-time.) Ultimately, it’s let down by a camera app that is slow at switching between cameras and will randomly close for no reason, which makes it frustrating to take photos with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txzVUzQNArBSUldpMHGKeU1EaBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121642/gsin_190410_4934_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0eOIY"&gt;There is no doubt you’re paying a premium for the rugged design of the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW — despite the fact it has cheap components that are more common in sub-$300 budget phones. It’s a shame it doesn’t use a faster processor or feature better cameras for a phone that is almost $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvqoKv"&gt;There are plenty of other, better phones in this price range, including Google’s own Pixel 6. But if you’re looking for a rugged phone and want to use Verizon’s faster mmWave 5G network, the DuraSport is really the only budget rugged 5G phone available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsci4J"&gt;If having excellent cameras on your phone is more important to you, and you are willing to accept a water-resistant (IP67) rather than a waterproof one (IP68), then the $449 Pixel 5A with 5G would be a better choice. After all, they look and feel almost identical to each other, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okGCOQ"&gt;The peace of mind of having a phone that can handle serious spills and drops without needing to be replaced within a few years, thanks to Kyocera’s two-year warranty, is worthwhile, but most of us are better off just investing in a durable case for another phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="XCHVNL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10988492"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S0pRvT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 1:30PM ET, January 21st, 2022:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this review stated the DuraForce 5G UW does not support wireless charging. That is incorrect, the phone includes support for Qi charging. Also added information about optional wired fast charging. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review: just off the mark</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;You should probably buy the Pixel 6 instead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LGdSLx"&gt;There’s a category in the smartphone market that has emerged over the past few years that I’ll call “value flagships.” Buying one feels a little like getting away with something — nearly all the features of a high-end device with a significantly lower price. Phones like the iPhone SE, Pixel A-series, and Samsung’s Galaxy S20 FE are classics of the genre, combining the right features for the right price at the right time. With its second entry in the category — the Galaxy S21 FE — Samsung is just a little off the mark on all the elements that would have made this a great value flagship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yn39O7"&gt;The S21 FE arrives very late in the S21 family’s product cycle, taking some of the shine off of the “this year’s flagship for less” appeal. It also offers just about everything you get from the standard S21, with the exception of a couple fewer gigs of RAM, a lower-quality telephoto camera, and a slightly larger screen. But at $699 it’s also not significantly cheaper than the $799 S21. Considering that the S21 is often discounted and that the S22 is likely to arrive soon, the S21 FE doesn’t look like much of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6vhuw"&gt;No doubt, the S21 FE is a good device. Its Snapdragon 888 processor and 6GB of RAM provide seamless, fast performance for most tasks. A 6.4-inch OLED screen offers smooth scrolling with its 120Hz refresh rate. And even with a big, bright, high refresh rate screen, its battery will take you through a full day. It’s just hard to recommend it to anyone when just $100 more will get you the S21 — and $100 less will buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;very good Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8gsWSA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10974661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Prj0nwwxLY04hOolUfQvKdyDKFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142237/ajohnson_220102_4951_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE’s 6.4-inch screen features a 120Hz refresh rate, making animations and scrolling super smooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ebxaqu"&gt;The S21 FE features a 6.4-inch 1080p OLED screen that’s bright and vibrant with rich blacks — classic Samsung. Bezels are very slim, and that 120Hz refresh rate makes animations and scrolling oh so smooth. There’s Gorilla Glass Victus protecting the front panel and the frame is aluminum. A quick, reliable optical fingerprint scanner is embedded in the display. So far, so flagship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NYmtA"&gt;The back is composite plastic rather than a higher-end glass panel, but such is the case with the S21, too. The S21 FE’s camera bump is plastic rather than the metal finish that bleeds into the chassis on the S21, so that’s a little bit of a value concession. But with the other high-end components and a lovely screen to look at, this feels like a device on the very highest rung of the midrange ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="K4bMoF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this feels like a device on the very highest rung of the midrange ladder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77bVrJ"&gt;There’s a 4,500mAh battery on board that easily lasted through a day of moderate use in my testing. Power users may find themselves in the single digit battery percentage at the end of a day, especially with the screen smoothness setting at its 120Hz default. There’s no option for a variable refresh rate, which would help conserve battery life while using the higher refresh rate setting — just standard 60Hz or 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBI0QS"&gt;The S21 FE supports 15W fast-ish wireless charging and faster 25W wired charging. A power adapter is not included in the box — just a USB-C cable. The S21 FE doesn’t support fast charging over a computer’s USB port, so if you want the best speeds and don’t have a compatible power brick on hand you’ll need to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Biaoqfwf-uQICSE7ZkUWEE1Njo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142240/ajohnson_220102_4951_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall performance is excellent with a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zJNxzG"&gt;The S21 FE includes the same top-notch Snapdragon 888 processor as the rest of the S21 series, but offers 6GB of RAM as the base model option compared to the S21’s 8GB. I didn’t see this having any significant impact in day-to-day use; the S21 FE opens apps quickly and jumping between them is seamless. The phone got warm playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; but kept up with the action. The only place I notice a bit of lag is in the live preview using portrait mode on the camera, but that’s a processing-intensive mode and I wouldn’t expect seamless rendering. For most purposes, performance is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8lCvT"&gt;The S21 FE ships with Android 12-based One UI 4.0 and all of the new system customization options it has to offer. If you set a photo as your wallpaper, the phone will suggest a complementary color palette to apply to buttons and icons. You can also scale and adjust your homescreen and lock screen wallpaper independently. Best of all, the stock weather app no longer features conspicuous ads at the top of the screen — just some links to clickbaity Weather Channel articles toward the bottom, which I can live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIOLTVTm2NWjrnGvIuBEYYNbNc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142239/ajohnson_220102_4951_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE offers the same 12-megapixel rear camera as the S21, but its ultrawide and telephoto modules are different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0mkTWc"&gt;The S21 FE features the same main rear camera — a 12-megapixel f/1.8 module with optical stabilization — as the standard S21. The telephoto camera is different, though, with a much smaller 8-megapixel sensor and 3x optical zoom rather than the S21’s 64-megapixel 3x hybrid digital / optical zoom. Still, it’s a stabilized, true optical telephoto camera, and those aren’t exactly guaranteed in the under-$800 class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uM488"&gt;It is possible to take 30x hybrid zoom images with the S21 FE, but the camera is working with a lot less data than the S21, so photos at that length look (predictably) like watercolors. Photos at the native 3x zoom look much better — even in dim indoor lighting, I managed to get some acceptably sharp portrait mode photos with the zoom lens. That is no small feat for a tiny sensor. Personally, I’d prefer if the main camera was the default for portrait mode rather than the zoom, but that might be just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T20DTF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10974713"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6QDwUg"&gt;The S21 FE’s main camera performs well overall. Photos are bright and saturated, as we expect from Samsung, and night mode renders an impressive amount of detail, provided your subject isn’t moving. It can’t quite match the Pixel 6’s camera for detail retention, in either night or standard shooting modes, and the S21 FE’s warmer, more saturated look isn’t my favorite. It’s not the very best camera in its class, but it does a reliably good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilOpdJ"&gt;There’s an ultrawide camera, too, which is slightly less wide than the S21’s. The 32-megapixel front-facing camera is a fixed-focus affair, whereas the S21’s selfie cam offers autofocus. The first time you use the selfie camera it asks you to choose between “natural” and “bright” color tones. As someone who prefers the natural setting, I appreciate that I didn’t have to dive into the menu to find it. Both the ultrawide and selfie cameras do their jobs just fine, and I don’t suspect that prospective S21 FE owners will care too much about the differences between them and their S21 counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upwKDy-O6wfAM0xYH8HjK7xtxsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142236/ajohnson_220102_4951_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The components are right, but the price and timing leave the S21 FE in a strange spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kzftDP"&gt;Despite all of those positive qualities I just ran through, the S21 FE is a fine phone that makes sense for very few people. Those who don’t have any particular allegiance to Samsung would probably be very happy with the Pixel 6 for $100 less. It meets or exceeds the S21 FE’s capabilities in just about every way — it has a better camera, is built with premium materials on the front and back, includes a little more RAM, and offers comparable performance from its new Google-designed Tensor chip. True, you don’t get a telephoto camera (that’s reserved for the $899 6 Pro) and its top screen refresh rate is 90Hz, not 120Hz. If those features are worth an extra $100 to you, then consider the S21 FE. All others should proceed to the Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3oYv9"&gt;If you are a committed Samsung Fan, then you probably don’t mind paying an extra $100 for the S21 to get an extra couple of bells and whistles. In fact, you probably have already. With its lower cost and composite back panel, the S21 is kind of already the Fan Edition of the S21 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gd7HcD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE leaves me with very little to complain about, but not a lot to recommend it above the alternatives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CCn61A"&gt;Still, there’s something to be said for a phone with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;very good support policy&lt;/a&gt; (three major OS updates and four years of security updates), a decent telephoto camera, and (mostly) top-shelf components that costs well under $1,000. I’d typically steer potential buyers to the Pixel phone for faster software updates, but Samsung appears to be committed to at least getting the major OS updates out earlier than in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RTjIxP"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE leaves me with very little to complain about, but not a lot to recommend it above the alternatives. If you’ve held off this long waiting for it and you don’t want to wait another few weeks to see what the S22 might offer, then by all means buy this phone. But if you’re more of a casual observer than a fan, I don’t think this is the device for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The best phone of 2021: iPhone 13, Pixel 6, iPhone 13 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 13 Mini, Pixel 5A, and Samsusng Galaxy Z Fold 3." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QthQgLW_qoVuV8_gEhvnwYZf3x4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_Fall_2021.12.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3x5kdo"&gt;Due to a confluence of factors in 2021 — from production delays thanks to the ongoing pandemic, rising costs of labor and components, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; — prices for flagship phones have been higher than ever. The absolutely premium phones, like the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, now cost well over $1,000, or about the price of a good laptop. Even if you’re willing to shell out top dollar for the best smartphone of 2021, it’ll take lots of luck and patience to get one into your hands this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxr7Qk"&gt;Thankfully, you no longer have to spend a huge amount to get something amazing, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $600 to 800 this year. In fact, if you like Android, the best phone for your buck this holiday season is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$599 Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. For everyone else, our pick for the best overall phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;$829 Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ugNMR"&gt;And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even less. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I7S1w"&gt;A great smartphone should last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. After all, upgrade cycles are slowing down: people are holding onto their phones for longer, so they’re looking for features that will last a few years. Believe it or not, most top phones are pretty neck and neck in terms of their user experience and features these days — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 can do it all: it hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="63WdF8"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="meCBEI"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2xAh9b"&gt;Out of the four iPhone 13 variants that Apple launched in 2021, the $829 iPhone 13 (unlocked) hits the sweet spot between price, pocketability, and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWggHi"&gt;It has a new processor, a bigger battery, 128GB of internal storage, and uses the same large camera sensor as the acclaimed iPhone 12 Pro Max, but you wouldn’t know it from its compact size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtOjH2"&gt;In fact, the 13 looks almost identical to the 12 but is just a bit thicker and heavier, with substantially bigger camera bumps and lenses that swapped places. (No, you won’t be able to reuse your iPhone 12 case for the 13.) Otherwise, it has the same overall design, a brighter 6.1-inch OLED display, the same 12-megapixel selfie camera, the same MagSafe wireless charging, the same water and dust resistance (IP68), and the same support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G networks. On top of all that, it comes in five colors (including pink), one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfcR8W"&gt;What’s different with the iPhone 13’s new A15 Bionic chip is that it should still feel fast in years to come, but it’s difficult to measure significant speed improvements with iPhones. The new chip helps the iPhone 13 run more efficiently, which lasts well into the evening without needing a top up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZlh8X"&gt;Using the same camera sensor that made the iPhone 12 Pro Max the best smartphone camera for photos and videos in 2020, the iPhone 13’s main wide-angle camera has &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jyZ2NJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt; For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BzMqAW"&gt;significantly improved. Photo details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. Its ultrawide camera, on the other hand, has only been minorly updated for better low-light performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwNczv"&gt;Video quality is also great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow-mo and handles them all super well. It even lets you record videos in Cinematic mode, which helps you smoothly switch focus between subjects by changing the depth of field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymvwy3"&gt;The iPhone 13 starts with 128GB of storage. Because its storage is not expandable, and depending on how you’ll be using the phone, you might want to bite the bullet and upgrade to the next tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;For most people, the iPhone 13 is an easy choice: it offers similar performance, design, camera features, and (sometimes) better battery life than other iPhone 13 models, for less money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eK0QNl"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 (right) is Google’s first flagship phone, and it’s already right up there with the best from Apple and Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1IUao"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5xQzeU"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HijJkz"&gt;The Pixel 6 is a lot of phone for $599. As Google’s first true flagship phone since 2019, the Pixel 6 gets many things right and is right up there with the iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in camera quality, overall performance, and battery life. When you consider the fact the Pixel 6 is a good $200 less than its rivals, it’s simply the most value-packed flagship phone for Android fans this year. Sorry, OnePlus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKm2Sq"&gt;You can tell the Pixel 6 from the Pixel 6 Pro by its slightly smaller 6.4-inch, 1080p OLED flat display and bolder color choices like two-tone red or green (black is also an option). For a relatively big phone, the Pixel 6 is not too thick yet feels substantial. That said, its glossy body is super slippery, so you’ll need to budget for a third-party case (forget the Google ones, they aren’t worth the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0j9tZm"&gt;At the heart of the Pixel 6 is Tensor, Google’s first proprietary mobile processor that is on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip inside other Android flagships. Tensor allows the new Pixel to lean into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to learn some new tricks. You can use the Magic Eraser to remove photo-bombers from your photos, take &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fUDR1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s simply the most value packed flagship phone for Android fans this year.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2QbW6"&gt;photos that better reflect real skin tones, as well as use Google Assistant to handle automated calls for you. The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, and runs the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12 software&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s new Material You theming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmSNYb"&gt;Inside its sizable rear camera bar are dual cameras, 50-megapixel wide and 12-megapixel ultrawide cameras, along with a laser detection autofocus sensor for low-light and depth. Unlike the Pixel 6 Pro, the 6 doesn’t have a telephoto camera. Still, its images are very good in both normal and low light and very competitive with the best from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 4,614mAh battery (should last two days for light users), supports Qi wireless charging, and has some protection from rain storms (IP68). Its main weakness is a slow under-screen fingerprint scanner, and the phone lacks a face unlock option. While not perfect, the Pixel 6 is an all-around good phone for $599 and is our pick for the best Android phone to buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same camera system, so either Pro models will be good for content creation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ovaxxT"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dctrOj"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BudYKV"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max share the same top-of-the-line camera system this year, and they are our pick as &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;iPhone for photos and videos. This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system — you get the same experience with either of the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CewoNz"&gt;The three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, particularly in low light. If photo and video quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 13 Pro is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYma8C"&gt;The 13 Pro has a physically larger camera sensor compared to prior models that allows its main 12-megapixel camera to gather more light and produce better-quality images, especially in dark or challenging lighting conditions. Its ultrawide camera is able to take stunning macro photos, thanks to its new close focus capability. In addition, the 3x optical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKFScJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This time around, you don’t have to buy the biggest and most expensive model to get the best camera system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jxI2pw"&gt;zoom on the telephoto lens makes for great portrait photography. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization make for stable and beautiful videos, even in low light. You can even shoot and edit videos directly in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212832"&gt;ProRes&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone 13 Pro (as long as you have a 256GB or higher storage model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;For those looking for the best Android camera system available, we recommend getting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;$899 Google Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, especially if a telephoto lens is a must. We pitted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro cameras in a comparison video&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are pretty evenly split. While the Pixel 6 Pro’s video capabilities are still behind the iPhone, it can more than hold its own on stills, and its telephoto camera is even better than the iPhone 13 Pro’s. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini has all the same cameras and features as its siblings but packs a smaller battery for light users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fEdsxM"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fRQPIp"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yu67SC"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 13 Mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 13 Mini is one of very few small phones on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALR5kS"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the Mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OR8NaU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rLWG16"&gt;One important downside to a smaller phone: the iPhone 13 Mini has a smaller battery that probably won’t last a power user through a whole day without a charge. It’s really designed for a lighter user who isn’t glued to the phone all day. Otherwise, the Mini is the same phone as the iPhone 13: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;If you prefer Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22431051/asus-zenfone-8-review"&gt;Asus Zenfone 8&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s a little bigger than the 13 Mini with a 5.9-inch screen, and it doesn’t work on Verizon, but it’s otherwise a very similar proposition: great build quality, top-notch processor, and high-end features like a 120Hz screen all tucked into a pocket-friendly device.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a built-in S Pen and a battery that can last two days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGzRrM"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="osyeHY"&gt;If you’re looking for a premium phone with a stylus and amazing battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still the one for you. Because this device originally launched in 2020, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;rumors that Samsung will be discontinuing the series in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczza1"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant 6.9-inch OLED display is 2K in resolution and supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM, so it can perform without a hiccup. Together, these elements make the S Pen sing by cutting down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G41prk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;you might be able to score some deals for this device — if you can find one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOPhPE"&gt;the latency between inking and what you see on-screen. While its triple rear camera system is not as good as the iPhone 13 Pro’s, it’s still one of the most advanced you can get. With its 4,500mAh battery, you can expect about two days of use before you’ll need a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KsgWM"&gt;Although you can technically use the S Pen with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it isn’t built into the phone like it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. If you want your S Pen and phone in one clean color-coordinated package, you’ll need to get the Note 20 Ultra while it’s still available.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the perks of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is its 1.9-inch exterior screen for widgets and notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PoZM83"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kSVtiN"&gt;Best flip phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PDkqPQ"&gt;Sick of smartphones that only get bigger and heavier when all you want is for some new ways to use your phone? Samsung’s third go at a flip phone seems to strike the right balance of whimsy, technical prowess and price that make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 appealing to mainstream users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdAmnF"&gt;For $999.99, this 4.2-inch pocketable device can transform into a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED display that is bright and has a fast 120Hz refresh rate. The screen can also be used as a split screen for multitasking. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch outer second screen, which displays handy widgets like app notifications and audio player controls without making you open the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="77t8Vy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcXpK"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as any other flagship phone released in 2021. Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screen time between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLTJff"&gt;It’s too bad its dual cameras did not get an upgrade from the previous iteration. Both the 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras, as well as the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, take good but not great photos. Due to the Z Flip 3’s form factor, it can double as a mobile tripod for the cameras, which makes for some fun new ways to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,400 Motorola Razr (2020&lt;/a&gt;), the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 hits at just the right price and style point for it to mainstream the idea of a flip phone. It’s hard to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;how durable this foldable screen&lt;/a&gt; will be, but at least you can be among the first to find out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZtA5cf"&gt;Best phone under $300 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="o8vynA"&gt;Not everyone needs a premium flagship phone, and even a budget phone can be a delight to use these days. If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S will defy your expectations for what a budget should look and feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI5uYL"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional security option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xa3xoR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’s vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WI8Y8C"&gt;While the 20S’s camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1ZKhC"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even a $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, good battery life, for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A will receive three years of OS and security updates from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R9fmdS"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r9nZkH"&gt;Best Android phone under $500 in 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nicCXJ"&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album: those who are in the know love it, but most casual Android users may not even know it exists. It’s only available from Google’s online store because carriers don’t carry the Pixel 5A, but it’s worth the effort to get this hidden gem of a $450 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62kYmA"&gt;The Pixel 5A has made some key upgrades from the discontinued Pixel 5: its screen is now a bit bigger at 6.3 inches, it has a slightly bigger battery at 4,680mAh, and it provides some dust and water protection (IP67). Otherwise, it has the same beloved camera sensor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, 6GB RAM, as well as 5G connectivity (sub-6GHz 5G). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="DFlWgw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Google Pixel 5A is a bit like the hidden track on the b-side of an album&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xRhhw"&gt;Like its predecessors, the Pixel 5A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with flagships that cost $1,000 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually a few years old now. It means the Pixel 5A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcPo00"&gt;One of the benefits of getting a Pixel is that it’ll be first in line for the latest Android updates. Google has committed to providing three years of OS and security updates to the 5A. Android 12 is already available for it, and it will be one of the first models to get the next version after that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third time’s the charm for the $1,800 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it’s still too expensive for most.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xBwOAb"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PiiTyN"&gt;Best folding phone of 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fWZzLE"&gt;If you’ve been waiting patiently for the foldable phone to mature before dropping some serious coin for one, this might be the year to get the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738082/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-folding-phone-dual-screen-multitasking"&gt;Microsoft’s dual-screen Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; is a distant second to the Fold 3, in this early two-device race.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ADSUM"&gt;The Fold 3 is Samsung’s third-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a skinny smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WScnfM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cJXDD"&gt;browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone. It also has an extra 6.2-inch screen on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution, so you can use it for quick tasks when you don’t have enough time or space to unfold the main screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WmHwM"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 3 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, all its cameras are sub-par, and its 4,400mAh battery is a bit small to power so many screens. While the Fold 3 is water resistant (IPX8), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;durability of its foldable screen and hinge&lt;/a&gt; remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 3 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. At $1,800, you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half. If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 3 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rsSZIW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO6Eoz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHxEoXqr1i6JVkup6wsoJeDPpyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/best_phone_grid_16x9.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best budget phones of 2021: iiPhone SE (2020), Pixel 5A, OnePlus Nord N200 5G, TCL 20S, Moto G Pure, Samsung Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a 90Hz screen, or 5G support&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="7By4QV"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget this holiday season, we’ve got good news: you’re more likely to find mid-range sub-$500 phones available than many of the hottest flagships of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZY6SyC"&gt;Due to an unfortunate series of events — from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;ongoing chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, labor shortage, the pandemic, and global shipping delays — retailers are having a hard time keeping phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 or iPhone 13 Pro in stock; Samsung has been hit particularly hard with supply issues all year. Fortunately, there are many excellent alternatives that are nearly as capable and cost a lot less to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WU3Cg6"&gt;Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are also finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with lower prices and more premium features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoCnCZ"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone&lt;em&gt; that &lt;/em&gt;much harder. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything well at this price point. So prioritize the features that matter most to you, whether it’s 5G compatibility with a particular network, high-resolution screen, low price, best camera, or longevity with software updates. It’s difficult to get straight A’s in every single one of these needs, but if you’re able to tolerate the occasional B, you’ll find a phone you’ll love. We recommend getting an unlocked phone for the best price and portability, but you might find better deals by buying through a carrier and signing up for a wireless plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Svhy7y"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s well over a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people. While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQUJ3j"&gt;If you’re looking for the best budget Android phone, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; is our top choice. You’ll find an all-around good phone with a flagship-level camera, three years of software updates from Google, plus IP67 water resistance — all at a lower price than last year’s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuCkqJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best iPhone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QjIUAS"&gt;Apple’s iPhone SE 2020 (2nd-generation) strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people. Even though it’s over a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YYEN"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today, which also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market. High-refresh-rate screens with smoother animations and scrolling have been trickling down into the budget class recently, but you won’t find one here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TvHua"&gt;The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is two years behind the latest and greatest and won’t win any benchmark races. (That would be the A15 chipset in the iPhone 13 lineup.) It’s still plenty performant, though, and it’s often hard to tell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="878itp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x5bwzf"&gt;the difference between a two-year-old iPhone processor and a brand-new one in use. But why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in comparison to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUd3WA"&gt;Cellular connectivity is limited to LTE, which is fine for now but might be limiting in a few years when 5G networks become more widely available. If you’re looking for the fastest wireless connectivity, the SE is not going to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9LjWN"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="smYbEU"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Pixel 5A." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OsDX3SyDEYXfF58kJLK4zYKEcXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781446/ajohnson_210813_4713_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5A’s 6.34-inch screen isn’t huge, but it’s just big enough to not look out of place next to the 6.5-inch competition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B9aQm4"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MeddEq"&gt;The best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7LCnMV"&gt;If you’re looking for the best sub-$500 Android phone, the Pixel 5A is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZV88A"&gt;The $449 Pixel 5A has a 6.34-inch OLED screen that’s on the smaller side for the budget class, but it’s bigger than the previous-gen 6.2-inch panel on the Pixel 4A 5G. There’s a bigger battery, too: a 4,680mAh cell that will last through a full day of heavy use and well into day two if you’re a lighter user. The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance for added peace of mind in the event of accidental spills or tumbles into water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD7mEy"&gt;That’s more or less the extent of the 5A’s improvements over its predecessor. The 5A’s dual rear-facing cameras (main and ultrawide), Snapdragon 765G processor, as well as the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage combination, were inherited from the 4A 5G and still deliver solid performance in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4bk7u"&gt;Software is another area where Pixel phones shine, and the 5A is no exception. It launched with Google’s own Android 11 OS and has already gotten upgraded to Android 12. The software is refreshingly free of the added clutter that other manufacturers sometimes pile onto it. The Pixel 5A is also guaranteed three years of OS upgrades and security updates, which isn’t quite as long as Apple or Samsung’s standard software support timespan but is certainly better than a lot of the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uppsrx"&gt;There’s also, of course, 5G connectivity. You won’t get the super-fast mmWave flavor of 5G support, but you will be able to access the slower but more common, sub-6GHz 5G network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7fhLs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 5A also offers IP67 water resistance &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cubsS1"&gt;But there’s a weird question mark over whether Google will support another set of frequencies that AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon will start using in the near future called the C-band. The company isn’t committing to making the necessary software update to use it, despite supporting it in hardware. It’s a strange blemish on the 5A’s otherwise strong feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHUScD"&gt;The 5A is also getting somewhat of a limited release: it isn’t being sold through any of the major US carriers, but you can buy it from the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/pixel-5a-5g?id=CR6HaBzv0AUAEggeh2gc79AFAA%3D%3D"&gt;Google Fi&lt;/a&gt;. All in, the Pixel 5A is still the budget Android phone we’d recommend. It’s not flashy, but it’s well priced and has it where it counts.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G offers a 120Hz fast refresh-rate screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qyhaRs"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7CPw9a"&gt;The best phone display for $500 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qpM5xB"&gt;If you’re looking for the best display for your money, the $500 Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great option for future-proofing your phone, albeit at the very top of this buying guide’s price range, but it’s well worth its higher price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpya2a"&gt;The A52 5G’s 6.5-inch screen is an OLED panel that’s bright with good contrast that’s generally nice to look at. But its best feature is a subtle one: a 120Hz refresh rate that gives a much smoother appearance to animations and content as you swipe and scroll through menus and social feeds. We’ll likely see this feature make its way into more budget phones soon, but for now, the A52 5G is one of only a few to offer better than the standard 60Hz screen in its class, and it makes the experience of using the phone that much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99z3je"&gt;The phone overall performs well for its class with a Snapdragon 750G processor and 6GB of RAM. You may notice the occasional hesitation or stutter with heavy tasks, but otherwise, everyday scrolling, app switching, and navigating are handled easily. And even with a power-hungry display, the Galaxy A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery should get you through at least a day of moderate to heavy use before needing another charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIU18y"&gt;One of the A52 5G’s not-so-bright spots is Samsung’s current take on Android, which puts a lot of pre-downloaded apps on your phone that you probably don’t want, and it even &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="85J3ce"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ZNpo"&gt;includes the occasional ad in places like the native weather app. For a cleaner or more grown-up Android skin, look to the Pixel or OnePlus. The Galaxy A52 5G’s camera is another consideration: it’s capable, but it tends toward an oversaturated look. If you prefer a more natural look to your photos, then the Pixel 5A is the winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INZwJl"&gt;There’s also 5G, which we still don’t think is a feature you should run out and buy a new phone for, but it is nice to have the support here — particularly if you plan to hold on to your phone for a few years. This device doesn’t support super-fast mmWave 5G, but it’s hard to come by, so that’s not a huge loss. Importantly, it supports more widely available sub-6GHz bands and should be able to take advantage of improving 5G networks in the US over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOCh8W"&gt;You can buy a much less expensive device to get you through the next couple of years, and that’s just fine. But if you do want to make more of an investment in a phone that you can keep using three or four years from now, the A52 5G is your best bet right now on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjpWjB"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nCclP5"&gt;Best 5G phone for under $300 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpXOg"&gt;At $299, the OnePlus N10 5G brings 5G and some upscale features to a budget phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge4QQF"&gt;While you won’t find a fantastic screen here, its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits and only supports sub-6Hz 5G networks. It launched with Android 10, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XlPkb6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y4Y1Qv"&gt;OnePlus has released the update to Android 11 already. But that’s it — don’t expect to get Android 12 on this model. OnePlus is offering two years of security updates in addition to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FucmrC"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 5A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vB1WYg"&gt;If you prefer Samsung phones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is also well worth your consideration for two very good reasons: it’s a bit less expensive at $279 and will be supported with security updates for the next four years. However, it lacks some of the N10’s nicer features, like a higher refresh rate screen, good cameras, and a nicer implementation of Android. The A32 5G is a better pick if you want to hang on to your phone for as many years as possible, but the N10 is a more likable device overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOtHJH"&gt;What if both the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G are just beyond your budget, but you still want a 5G-ready phone in this price bracket? Luckily for you, the unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; retails for $240 (or lower from carriers) and includes some fancy features as well. You’ll be treated to a 1080p display that refreshes at 90Hz and a 5,000mAh battery, but it only includes 64GB of internal storage. Yes, it only works on T-Mobile’s sub-6GHz 5G network but will function as a 4G phone on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. For the price, it’s not a bad way to get in on all the 5G action. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20S has an usually vibrant screen for its class, thanks to TCL’s television display expertise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Oj4ljX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best 4G phone under $300&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="npapoA"&gt;The TCL 20S is proof that even $250 can buy a good phone without many compromises. It just nails all the basics that anyone would want from a phone: good performance, a good screen, and good battery life, all for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRkfu4"&gt;You might recognize the TCL brand from its popular budget smart TVs, where its screen expertise is what makes the TCL 20S’ vibrant, 6.67-inch 1080p screen a standout. The 20S has a layer of fingerprint-resistant, “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back that gives it a subtle shimmer. It has a quick fingerprint sensor that is built into its power button, as well as face unlock as an additional option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HhlvTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rA2h68"&gt;While the 20S’ camera system is nothing to write home about, its 64-megapixel main camera and 15-megapixel front camera are both more than capable of taking detailed photos in good lighting conditions — just don’t use them for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLPoSw"&gt;For a budget phone, the 20S has no noticeable lag in performance, thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM. By default, it comes with 128GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a 5,000mAh battery that lasts for around two days without a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;If your budget is sub-$300, and you are on the hunt for the best bang for your buck, the $250 TCL 20S is a solid choice that should work on all major 4G networks in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motorola’s Moto G Stylus (2021) is a good phone whether you’re a stylus devotee or just style-curious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;6.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;Motorola Moto G Stylus (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0wGhHB"&gt;The best budget phone with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MC6Jne"&gt;It’s slim pickings for Android users who want a new budget phone with a stylus. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;LG exiting the smartphone market this year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;Samsung pausing (or perhaps ending) its premium Galaxy Note series&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only Motorola’s Moto G Stylus left to hold the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Y0rd"&gt;Of the Motorola budget devices we’ve tested this year, the Moto G Stylus (2021) offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It’s a good phone for $280, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just stylus-curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyyTGB"&gt;It has a big 6.8-inch LCD display at 1080p resolution, good battery life with its 4,000mAh cell, and ample internal storage with 128GB of capacity. Thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 processor and 4GB of RAM, the G Stylus performs just fine with the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="fJsUIu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s a good phone for $280, whether you’re a stylus devotee or just stylus-curious&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3VEksQ"&gt;occasional hiccup. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44WwOS"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ stylus is built into the device like the Galaxy Note. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps, like its coloring book app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5Ppnc"&gt;There’s no telling how much longer Motorola will make the Moto G Stylus, so if you want a budget phone with a built-in stylus, you should grab one while you can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. TCL 20SE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The best 4G phone under $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3LcHIR"&gt;There are not many great phones available in the sub-$200 range, but the $190 TCL 20SE is a rare gem of its class. It has a 5,000mAh battery, ample onboard storage, and a beautiful “nano-photoetched” back that makes this budget phone look more expensive than it is, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPgkC4"&gt;As the most affordable model of the TCL 20 series, the TCL 20SE has a gigantic 6.82-inch display that is quite low in resolution at 720p but delivers brighter and more vibrant colors than other phones in its class — thanks to TCL’s television screen expertise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbBgrN"&gt;The 20SE’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor is supported by 4G of RAM, where they work well enough together to make &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; mostly playable, albeit with a slight lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7K8RPt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This budget phone looks more expensive than it is&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeESwB"&gt;Unlike other budget phones in this space, the 20SE comes with a generous 128GB of internal storage, plus a micro SD card slot for even more capacity. In addition, its 5,000mAh battery lasted a whopping 32 hours on one charge, using only Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1o43"&gt;While the 20SE’s 48-megapixel main camera can take great snaps in natural light, it’s not really meant for night or macro photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfkexN"&gt;All things considered, TCL 20SE is a smart choice for a sub-$200 4G phone, especially If you won’t be using Verizon as your carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bJEGA"&gt;However, if you’re on an even tighter budget and need a 4G phone that will work on all the major carriers, you should consider Motorola’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787370/moto-g-pure-review-4g-android-budget-phone"&gt;Moto G Pure&lt;/a&gt;. Retailing at $160 for the unlocked version, you may be able to find deals as low as free at some carriers — if you sign up for a plan this holiday season. While the Moto G Pure is slower and smaller than the TCL 20SE, it has a more capable 13-megapixel main camera (f/2.2 aperture) that works admirably in low-light situations. Unfortunately, the G Pure only comes with a paltry 32GB of internal storage, so you’ll need to budget for a microSD card to expand its extremely limited capacity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto G Pure review: an easy bargain</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For casual users, this $160 4G phone is good enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PfY8IN"&gt;The Moto G Pure is the rare $160 phone that works well enough that you forget you’re using a sub-$200 device. Yes, Motorola made some compromises to deliver a phone at this low price point, but it still nails all the basics that you should care about: good build quality, good battery life, and good cameras for the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik6WHn"&gt;That is not to say the Moto phone is perfect. Its processor is just a second slower in most tasks, it only works on 4G networks, and its paltry 32GB of internal storage is just not enough space to use for long. But for its price, it’s hard to argue against the Moto G Pure — it gets a lot right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VDmDAF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10871077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7hQaep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DI4Ddk"&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact, measuring 0.34-inch thick and weighing 0.41lbs. Thanks to its rounded corners and sloped edges, the G Pure is comfortable to hold for long stretches, though it’s a bit tall (the screen has a 20:9 aspect ratio) to use single-handed for my small hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OM443k"&gt;Available in deep indigo, the G Pure has a subtle sheen to its textured, matte back cover. Its plastic material is very hard and slippery, despite that texture. In fact, I’ve lost count of the number of times the phone has magically slipped off an ottoman or table and still works. Yes, this $160 Moto phone is quite durable, but I wouldn’t test the smartphone gods — you’ll still be better off with a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DncdMx"&gt;It has a snappy fingerprint sensor under the Motorola logo, as well as Face Unlock to give you a hands-free option to unlock your phone. I like that the Moto software gives you more control over how this works. You can use your face to unlock the phone (no need to press the power button first), and ask the phone to bring you to the last app or webpage that was opened (rather than the lockscreen). With good lighting, Face Unlock works well enough, but the fingerprint sensor is faster and more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Motorola Moto G Pure" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W2NRUxvZ044iPffFsdlFOZ-z8VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956983/gsin_190203_4806_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a big phone with a 6.5-inch screen, the Moto G Pure feels relatively compact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CuYpZV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Md2AB3"&gt;As part of the cost cutting to hit the G Pure’s low price, Motorola decided to use a weak processor and minimal RAM, and it shows. At the heart of the Moto phone is the MediaTek Helio G25 processor, which is &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/chipset-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-439-vs-mediatek-helio-g25"&gt;comparable to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 439&lt;/a&gt; but actually lags behind that 2018 Snapdragon chipset. Everything from opening a website, switching between apps, to opening the camera app to take a photo just takes an extra second on the Moto phone. While this doesn’t sound like much, those extra seconds really add up over the course of a day and can make you question your sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvxvTM"&gt;It has just 3GB of RAM to support its under-powered processor and a meager 32GB of internal storage. At this point, 32GB is simply not enough capacity for a phone, especially when most people are hanging onto their phones for longer. After just two weeks of light use — installing updates and a few apps, plus taking some photos — I’ve already burned through 18.04GB (56 percent of storage) on the G Pure. With Motorola promising one OS update and two years of security updates, you’ll likely run out of space before you run out of software support. Good thing it has a microSD card slot, where you can expand its limited capacity with up to a 512GB card.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor and side buttons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLvv2alnMT6GmDuVEDNdMV3fEfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956981/gsin_190203_4806_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Motorola logo is the Moto G Pure’s fingerprint sensor for securing your phone against intruders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHLGK"&gt;The G Pure’s 6.5-inch LCD screen may look vibrant with its brightness set to 100 percent, but it is only a 720p display, with a low 269 pixel density. At 1600 x 720p resolution, &lt;em&gt;The Spider-Man: No Way Home Trailer&lt;/em&gt; looks more pixelated and dim on the Moto than on the OnePlus 9’s 2K display. Day to day, you probably wouldn’t notice just how low-res the display is, but if you have any higher-quality screens in your life, it will stand out and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlHPgF"&gt;I played some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt; to stress test it, and performance was better than I expected, at least once I was able to launch the game fully. It took three tries and multiple force quits on it before I could actually play. Once the game finally loaded, I was able to move my pokemon around the battlefield without lag, with the battle music blaring from the lone speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qch758"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ISV0DW"&gt;Using only 4G service to test the G Pure’s 4,000mAh battery, I spent the day toggling between two email accounts, sharing content on Twitter and Hangouts, and playing some &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. The G Pure stayed cool to the touch no matter how much I was stressing it. Although the battery didn’t quite live up to the two days of use claim from Motorola, I got about 16 hours out of it (or about seven hours of screentime) before needing to hit the charger. Don’t expect a fast charge, though: It took me about two hours to recharge this battery with the included 10W charging brick. In all, the battery should last you a full day at minimum, or maybe as long as two days for a light user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure dual camera system closeup." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VaoTg8icuZpo5S9iQOv6bht5kBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956982/gsin_190203_4806_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure kept it simple with a rear, dual-camera system, rather than add a sub-par ultrawide or macro camera onto the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r3rGf7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BMQtq0"&gt;For a $160 phone, the cameras on the Moto G Pure are better than expected, especially for photos that you’ll likely only share online. Rather than squeeze another lackluster ultrawide or macro camera onto the back, Motorola made a smart decision to keep it simple with just a rear dual-camera system — a 13-megapixel main camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor — plus a 5-megapixel front-facing camera (f/2.4) for selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rMJcS"&gt;The 13-megapixel main camera with f/2.2 aperture was surprisingly capable at capturing details in low-light situations. At a recent indoor event with tricky lighting, it had no problems focusing with various light sources in dark rooms, and it managed to photograph small details in the art installations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8dfXCY6jPNW5r6UjmjnZ8cazmtg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23022110/IMG_20211022_222531879_MP_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the main camera is able to capture fine details even in low light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt1zjg"&gt;Like other smartphone cameras in this class, color accuracy seems to be an issue with the G Pure. Most photos look fine, but there are a few issues, like the pumpkins that look too red with stems that look too blue to be realistic. Likewise, the yellow door should look more orange, and the blue door should look more teal (with more green) than blue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWULVm9mnhfqf8fsESdpz8TbjOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021849/IMG_20211016_163007674_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moto G Pure camera test image: the two doors’ colors are not true to life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3XpYO"&gt;My biggest gripe with the G Pure’s camera is its slider interface for zooming. Unlike other camera apps where you can tap to select the most optimal digital zoom presets, Moto’s zoom slider doesn’t automatically appear in the app. In addition, your hand will probably block your screen as you try to frame your shot and navigate the slider bar at the same time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zCoupo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10870825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BII4oi"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the Moto Pure G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Moto G Pure’s camera app UI." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0StNfiklM-I1IDQqHb5VdPxkTNE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956986/gsin_190209_4806_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Pure’s zoom slider bar is not as easy to use as other phones’ camera app UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3355Ti"&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUmNa"&gt;At $160 — or less if you catch a sale or carrier deal, as this phone works on many 4G networks in America — it’s hard to deny that the Moto G Pure will be good enough for most people looking for a basic budget phone for under $200. After all, it has an all-day battery, a versatile main camera, all in a well-designed, durable package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDQZ0q"&gt;It’s a shame it doesn’t have a faster processor, more RAM, or more onboard storage, which would make it a clear winner. I’d rather Motorola charge a slightly higher price like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;$190 TCL 20SE&lt;/a&gt;, which offers 128GB of internal storage, has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor, and is supported by 4GB of RAM. At least you wouldn’t have to constantly worry about backing up the files from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pmtp8a"&gt;But these issues might not be deal-breakers for more casual users or those with a strict budget. Not many great phones are available at this price point, and the Moto G Pure is quite the catch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia G50 review: affordable but awfully average</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Why suffer for a $300 budget 5G phone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AaZTJg"&gt;Finding a good budget 5G phone seems as elusive as finding a unicorn these days. Not only do manufacturers have to keep the price as low as possible, but the device also has to pull off some advanced 5G-compatible technologies. No wonder phone makers tend to compromise on other components, and the overall experience takes a hit as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiJZLo"&gt;This is where I find the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687760/nokia-g50-phone-battery-android-upgrades"&gt;Nokia G50&lt;/a&gt;, the $300 phone that Nokia pitches as an affordable 5G-phone alternative. While the Nokia G50 is a solidly built phone with a minimalist, no-nonsense Scandinavian aesthetic, it has many flaws that I haven’t experienced in a modern smartphone in a long time. Its entry-level 5G processor lags, its low-resolution touchscreen requires more effort to use than others, and I even had some connection issues with my 4G T-Mobile service on this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hVCPW"&gt;These are significant trade-offs for a device that is not the only $300 5G phone in town, assuming you need 5G connectivity at all. There is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; that is a T-Mobile exclusive, the newer and cheaper &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$279 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt;. It’s hard to see how the Nokia G50 could possibly stand out from this increasingly crowded, budget 5G space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fTlwZX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10843493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="G4pAdw"&gt;Heavy. That’s the first word that comes to mind when holding this 6.84 x 3.06 x 0.35-inch phone that weighs 7.76oz (220g), which is heavier and taller than the Pixel 6 Pro (7.4 oz; 210g). While I appreciate that its stainless steel-framed body is a rarity in smartphones these days (other than the much more expensive Pro-model iPhones), this phone is too heavy to hold with just one hand for long. Its sharp edges dig into my palms due to its heft and make me eager to put the device down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R37XDV"&gt;As classy as that Ocean Blue matte ombre looks, the G50’s smooth polycarbonate coating is a sucker for finger smudges and makes the phone way too slippery to use without a case. I can’t tell you how many times the phone has slipped off a table or countertop, thanks to a combination of its slippery back and the vibrate mode. My review unit only survived the falls because it’s built like an indestructible tank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6ATy29iSPGiUEvElKGocVnKQ2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940472/akrales_211015_4805_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On its right side, the Nokia G50 has a handy fingerprint sensor embedded into its power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tpVyMH"&gt;Its durability is definitely a plus since Nokia (and brand licensee HMD Global) expects you to keep this Android 11-running phone for longer and is committed to providing two years of OS updates and three years of security updates. This is not as impressive as it sounds: the $279 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G provides four years of security updates, which is the longest out of this class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TtDBy"&gt;Like other Nokia Android phones, the G50 has a non-customizable Google Assistant button and a combination SIM and microSDXC tray on its left side, a volume rocker, as well as a power button embedded with a fingerprint sensor on the right. It has a 3.5mm audio jack on top for your wired headphones or mic, as well as a USB-C port and a mono speaker at the bottom. Because the speaker is located on the bottom right corner, it’s easy for your hand to cover the sound. When listening to the &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; theme song from the HBO series, the opening percussion track sounds more muffled and buzzy on the Nokia, whereas each beat sounds clear and distinct on the OnePlus 9 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EdLwsX"&gt;One of the ways Nokia cut corners with the G50 is by using a 720p low-resolution display.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W6i4pg2LMUX2M-BzIsf-IFPoZiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940475/akrales_211015_4805_0051.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 comes with a pre-applied screen protector, which you can feel around the edge of the display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MYVXcF"&gt;The G50’s 6.82-inch, 720 x 1560 LCD display is simply too big for so few pixels to produce sharp, high-resolution content. Although its IPS LCD panel does offer good viewing angles with vibrant colors, it doesn’t make up for its low-resolution or 252ppi pixel density. It’s a fine screen for reading emails and social media posts, but there is a noticeable difference when looking at multimedia content. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAOcTfVX5IHtCBRNm73e2-VGr8M=/0x0:2040x1360/1075x1075/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073384/Verge10yearEditorsnote_homepage_2.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; 10th Anniversary image with the stacked motherboards&lt;/a&gt;, for example, looks pixelated and has blurred edges at maximum zoom on the Nokia phone, but lines still look sharp on the OnePlus 9 Pro, even when completely zoomed in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3NiUi"&gt;Not only does the G50 have a low-resolution screen, but it’s also not as touch-sensitive as other modern phones, where you only need to lightly brush the display to navigate the interface. When I was playing &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, for example, I had to exert more force with each of my swipes to move my character along the battlefield. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it makes this phone a little less enjoyable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxZqd0"&gt;The G50 comes pre-installed with a screen protector, which explains the weird horizontal streaks that run across the screen when the phone is off, as well as the slightly raised edge around the display. The screen protector looks invisible when the phone is on, but if you’re looking at a video with a significant black frame around it, random sightings of this layer can be distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dmRuqRm8RX12tnBgeoQBkahDR1M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940476/akrales_211015_4805_0062.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 has a stainless steel framed body and a polycarbonate coating in a matte, ombre finish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="69kQoI"&gt;The Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor may be responsible for making the Nokia G50 one of the few $300 5G phones around, but it might just be too underpowered for its ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhgUC5"&gt;Despite the fact the processor is supported with 4GB RAM and 128 GB of internal storage, the G50 sometimes struggles with very basic tasks. It can take an extra second longer to open a link or an app, or a web page would crash, and I’d have to reload it. The G50 also seems to have trouble multitasking when using a resource-intensive app like &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Unite&lt;/em&gt;. After I downloaded the game, I could not even open it until every single app I had running in the background was closed, and there were only three apps in the background. The game is playable on the G50, but the combination of its slower performance and less sensitive touchscreen can make it feel like you’re moving your character through molasses against faster opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JmyqV2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The $300 Nokia G50 is neither the cheapest nor the best budget 5G phone out there&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hAKozV"&gt;For a phone that is supposed to be future-proofed for 5G connectivity — at least on sub-6Hz 5G networks on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T and not Verizon’s mmWave network — the Nokia G50 I was testing had some trouble connecting to 4G LTE cellular service. My T-Mobile SIM card worked fine until the one day I needed cellular access, and no amount of restarting the phone would fix it. After speaking with HMD Global’s PR representative, I realized I was missing an important system update but had trouble installing it until it just installed itself on another day. My G50 has had no problem accessing my T-Mobile 4G service since then. It’s unclear whether my connection issue is a known problem with the hardware, or I just got unlucky with an update or just this particular unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LpiaR1"&gt;One place Nokia did not skimp on is the 5,000mAh battery in the G50. It is a nice luxury to have a large capacity battery in your phone, even for a $300 device. To test its battery life, I used only Wi-Fi to actively post on Twitter and Hangouts, read online articles, take photos, and check my two email accounts. All in, I was able to get about 28 hours of active use out of the G50 over two days, which tracks with other phones with 5,000mAh batteries like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt;. The included 18W charging brick is definitely not a fast charger, though, because it took almost three hours to recharge this gigantic battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BlXYnsiKNbUO7Oa7sw5etS0DVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940473/akrales_211015_4805_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tell this is a Nokia phone by its iconic circular array of three rear cameras on the back of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4dY15x"&gt;You can tell this is a Nokia phone by its iconic circular array of three rear cameras on the back of the phone. This may be a budget phone, but Nokia did not compromise on photography — at least not on the main 48-megapixel wide camera. It also has a 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, 2-megapixel depth camera, as well as a front 8-megapixel wide camera embedded into the bezel of the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNs4Za"&gt;The main camera, with its wide lens, f/1.8 aperture, and auto phase detection autofocus, can capture some detailed shots during the day, as well as on clear nights. You can still see the bubbles in my boiling-hot Korean stew and the distinct lamination layers in the pastry. I was particularly surprised by the night photo of colorful graffiti against the backdrop of an office tower. Using the 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, I was able to capture One World Trade and the Oculus in one shot, though, of course, the lights from the towers are all blown out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EF4zyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10843175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z20ECC"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the Nokia G50.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtSog2"&gt;The biggest downside to the ultrawide camera is that its photos’ colors are not always accurate. For example, the pastries look significantly more yellow in the ultrawide photo compared to the photo of the mini cakes from the main camera. The photo with the two colorful doors is another example of how the ultrawide camera skews yellow in misleading ways. While the two doors look like they’re yellow and blue in the photo, in real life, the doors are actually orange and teal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlP9Jl"&gt;If you need to capture anything that’s far away on a dim day, I wouldn’t bother using the cameras on this phone with digital zoom. I took some waterfront photos on a cloudy evening, and all the photos were either blurry messes or way too saturated with yellow lighting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MN6C-xtnxBIrxlkSMIVSn0TvRzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22940474/akrales_211015_4805_0039.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 is a $300 budget 5G phone that works on the sub-6GHz 5G network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sK98bD"&gt;The $300 Nokia G50 is neither the cheapest nor the best budget 5G phone out there, and you may be better served by its competitors. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt; uses the same Snapdragon 480 5G processor as the G50 but has a 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate for less money. Or, if you’re already a T-Mobile customer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; might be the better choice, as it uses the faster Snapdragon 690 5G processor and has the same HD display as its sibling. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; is another popular choice at $279. It uses a faster MediaTek Dimensity 720 5G processor, has four years of security updates, and is compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;newer 5G C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJkgcM"&gt;Yet all these budget 5G phones suffer from the same problem: they all had to compromise in some way to make room for its more expensive 5G components. Since 5G isn’t ubiquitous yet and is hardly essential to our lives in 2021, I’m not sure it’s necessary to limit yourself to 5G phones when there is a world of 4G phones that already offers better value and user experience. For around $300, you can get a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt; with a camera that will blow any budget 5G phone’s camera out of the water. Or you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22717002/tcl-20s-and-20se-review-budget-affordable-unlocked-smartphone"&gt;TCL 20S&lt;/a&gt; with premium looks and specs for just $250 and save some money toward your future 5G phone —  when the technology matures.&lt;/p&gt;

We also spoke with a HMD Global PR representative rather than a Nokia spokesperson, as previously stated. We regret these errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honor 50 review: lose a Huawei, gain a Google</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Google’s software makes the Honor 50 a contender rather than competitive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kUBDaT"&gt;It’s rare that you need to get into geopolitics at the outset of a smartphone review, but it’s impossible to avoid with the Honor 50. It’s the first Honor-branded device to release outside of China since the brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;spun out from parent company Huawei last year&lt;/a&gt;. It means that despite Huawei’s continued presence on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, Honor is now able to include Google’s apps and services on a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bho8iK"&gt;Having access to these services, which include critical parts of the Android ecosystem like Google Play in addition to apps like Google Maps and YouTube, means that the Honor 50 is the first Honor phone in years to actually have a shot at being a viable purchase for customers outside of China. Its midrange starting price of €529 (about $616) doesn’t hurt, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVw4Hm"&gt;But while leaving its former parent company has opened a Google-shaped window for Honor, it’s also closed a Huawei-shaped door. Honor is now on its own, without the backing of one of the most well-resourced technology companies in the world. As a result, while not a bad phone, the Honor 50 ends up not feeling competitive with other handsets in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhIbgR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10834487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1usZ"&gt;The Honor 50 starts at €529 (around $616) for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which is the version I’ve been using, but stepping up to €599 (about $698) gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Regardless of which option you go for, you get the same Snapdragon 778G processor and a 4,300mAh battery that can be fast charged at up to 66W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC0vPA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You get the choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NjxZsU"&gt;Honor’s phones have always been available with loud designs, and the Honor 50 is no different. My model came in a shiny white colorway, with the letters “HONOR” tiled across its back, and there’s also a garish sparkly silver color option available alongside more conventional black and green options. While I don’t love the color options, I think Honor deserves credit for its approach to the dual-ring camera bump on the Honor 50, which is a lot more interesting than the generic rectangles found on the backs of most devices (Huawei’s Nova 9 uses a very similar design, which Honor says is because the design was developed before the split).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVMwc7"&gt;Around front, the Honor 50 has a 6.57-inch 1080p OLED display, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a small centrally orientated hole-punch notch for the phone’s 32-megapixel selfie camera, which moderately curves around the left and right edges of the phone. I can’t fault the screen’s rich blacks or vibrant colors, and the under-display fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive. If you don’t like curved displays, then you won’t like the Honor 50’s, but at least the phone doesn’t suffer from any palm-rejection issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t82WZd3sISbJxPFlNaKC4jF-PuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963228/jporter_211025_4826_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A curved screen might not be to everyone’s tastes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d-r-IsZluIIa_rXonBd_Y9D03Ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963226/jporter_211025_4826_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like the camera bump more than the color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y7l4aF"&gt;The Honor 50’s screen has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes it feel fast to use and smooth to look at, and the Snapdragon 778G processor happily keeps up, even while the screen quickly scrolling through visually intensive apps like Twitter. I had no problems with performance during my time with the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TjJhn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no IP-rating and no wireless charging&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TggGOl"&gt;The rest of the specs are more basic. There’s no IP rating for dust and water resistance and no wireless charging, and when it comes to audio, the phone outputs sound from a basic downward-firing speaker. It’s loud enough for listening around the house, but you’ll be reaching for a pair of headphones in noisier environments. Honor includes a pair of USB-C headphones in the box, which is fairly unusual these days, and almost makes up for the lack of a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulJlYu"&gt;Honor’s Magic UI software, which runs atop of Android 11 on the Honor 50, is broadly inoffensive. However, it has its annoyances and, by default, is set up in a way that I think most people are going to want to tweak. For starters, it uses Microsoft’s SwiftKey rather than Google’s Gboard keyboard that I think most Android users will be more familiar with. There are also a ton of stock Honor apps that I disabled in my first couple of days with the phone, and I don’t love the way Honor’s software defaults to eschewing Android’s typical app drawer for an iOS-like homescreen. It’s easy enough to rectify with some tweaks, but it feels a little cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eq6YfkE9SHvOAV1u0qIM91qD_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963224/jporter_211025_4826_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone has four rear cameras in its camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tsf43s"&gt;I had no complaints with the battery life of the Honor 50, averaging a little over seven hours of screen on time between charges. I never had to put the phone on to charge at the end of the day with less than 40 percent charge remaining. The Honor 50 supports 66W fast charging via an included charger that’s branded as Honor’s own “SuperCharge” charging standard, which isn’t compatible with third-party chargers. Honor claims the included charger can get the phone from 0 to 100 percent charge in 45 minutes (unfortunately, my review sample came with an EU plug, so I was unable to verify this claim myself). But a full charge in under an hour is nothing to be sniffed at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S043nr"&gt;The headline camera specs of the Honor 50 appear to be impressive at first glance, but the devil’s in the detail. Yes, it’s a 108-megapixel quad-camera array, but there’s no telephoto camera, and beyond the main sensor, the three additional cameras are a comparatively low-resolution 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5rzBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10834528"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH69Sq"&gt;Things don’t get off to a great start with the Honor 50’s main camera. Even in daylight, there can be a distinct lack of detail in its shots, like in the shot of the black cat above, where there’s very little definition or texture in its fur. Colors are vibrant at the risk of being a little oversaturated, and faces come out looking a little too bright and textureless. White balance is at least pretty natural, and I think selfies come out generally looking OK, helped by the fact that there’s an easily accessible shortcut to turn on background blurring and a beauty mode slider (if that’s a feature you’re interested in). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caOsnn"&gt;Low light performance leaves a lot to be desired, where the Honor 50 produces shots that are dark and muddy. But the bigger problem is that the phone takes way too long to take photographs in low light. When trying to take a shot of a group of people at a party, the Honor 50 refused to take a photo for several agonizing moments, which is far longer than people at a party are willing to wait to have their photo taken for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVLEUhGmjx-P5x--gjLjWPl3NmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963229/jporter_211025_4826_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C and bottom-firing speaker, but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/648NqA0oDE6Rqeo032kNax-Cqm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963225/jporter_211025_4826_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 120Hz display is hard to fault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9VgiQb"&gt;At its starting price, the Honor 50 is a comfortably midrange device. But there are a lot of accomplished smartphones available at similar prices. Phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€499 for its step-up 12GB RAM / 256GB storage model) or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for its 128GB storage variant) are both excellent phones that offer a much more rounded experience than the Honor 50. And if you’re considering the Honor 50 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, then you’re just €50 away from the recently announced Pixel 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFEUIv"&gt;It’s a crowded part of the market, and simply having access to Google’s apps and services isn’t enough to make an impact. Honor’s software can feel bloated, and its camera is sluggish and lacking in detail. Speedy 66W fast charging and a slick 120Hz display aren’t enough to distract from the fact that the Honor 50 has some weak spots when compared against the best midrange handsets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="jX6wqK"&gt;Honor might be a viable purchase now that it can once again include Google’s apps and services on its devices. But it has more work to do if it wants to be truly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VegvPD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10834541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review: finally, more than just good cameras</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new Pixels are the best phones Google has ever made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1M4A8y"&gt;It’s rare that a new smartphone feels all that &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. The common refrain is that smartphones are all a “mature” technology and today’s new phone is only incrementally different from the prior one. There’s a lot of truth in that — Apple’s made 15 generations of iPhones! — and the newness you gain from plunking down hundreds of dollars every couple of years to upgrade rarely changes your day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBaQCn"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, however, are a bit more new than the typical phone, even though they don’t fold in half or have especially unique designs. They come with new cameras, new materials, new hardware, new software, and new thoughts on what a smartphone should be able to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADueEq"&gt;But a lot of this is new &lt;em&gt;for Google&lt;/em&gt; and not necessarily different from what you can get from a litany of other smartphone makers right now. The $599 Pixel 6 and $899 6 Pro are a reset for Google’s smartphone ambitions, a fresh start for the company that has slogged through five generations of Pixel phones without so much as a dent in the smartphone world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YgXao"&gt;As a result, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are not perfectly refined devices, nor do they do everything Google claims as well as you might expect. But that doesn’t stop them from being among the best phones available and perhaps the best Android phones to buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WiVH9P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10832253"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="e1X4X7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10832861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="U6xTbo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most distinctive part of the new Pixel 6 design is the camera bar on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r91XGl"&gt;The design of the new Pixel phones is a change of pace for Google and follows the conventions of other popular Android phone makers for the past few years. Instead of quirky textured finishes with fun pops of color, they are the typical glass and metal sandwich slabs with aluminum frames and slippery backs. There’s less whimsy and character to their details than prior Pixel phones, something I miss. And if you look closely, they aren’t quite as polished as the best from Apple and Samsung at this point — it’s easy to find a rough edge or two along the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djgaYO"&gt;The front of both phones is hard to distinguish from lots of other big Android phones on the market; they mostly resemble a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 or Note 20 to my eye. And while the back has a distinctive bar toward the top that houses the cameras, the whole thing reminds me of a TCL phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13npwk"&gt;The Pixel 6 is available in three two-tone colors — black, red, or green — while the Pixel 6 Pro is only available in more staid variations of black, white, or gold. The aluminum sides of the regular 6 are chunky and matte black, while the 6 Pro’s sides are thinner and polished to a shine. Between the two, the 6 is certainly more fun, while the 6 Pro doesn’t quite match up to other phones within its price tier in terms of design or fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kOUDs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These designs have less character or whimsy than Google’s earlier efforts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RE29Ja"&gt;The most prominent design element is the camera bar that spans the back of each phone. It’s large, sticks out far, and doesn’t quite blend seamlessly into the rest of the phone. On the plus side, it doesn’t cause the phone to rock on a table or desk when you put it down, unlike the camera bumps on other phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OaFr5"&gt;A lot of these design critiques are purely academic, though, because in reality you’re going to put a case on either phone and cover up any of the rough edges or boring colors. That’s an extremely good idea, too, because both phones are capital-L Large and their smooth glass backs are extremely slippery. I’ve had them slide off my desk, wireless chargers, sofa arms, tables, my lap, you name it, and one of our sample units actually fell hard enough to crack the Gorilla Glass Victus glass panel covering its screen. (Side note: I’ve been testing Google’s translucent recycled plastic cases alongside the Pixel 6 and they are horrible — I recommend checking out third-party options.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO5iLr"&gt;Really, my main problem with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s design is that they are just too big for my taste. They are challenging to use in one hand, they don’t fit comfortably in a lot of my pants pockets, and they are easy to drop. In prior years, Google offered both small and large versions of its phones, but for this sixth generation it’s big or bigger; the size difference between the two is negligible. These are iPhone Pro Max-size phones, which is fine if you want a big phone but leaves out those of us who aren’t fans of oversized slabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZFY2OIMElXN-iNEcQuGV6bNN5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934833/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have big, spacious displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gWyOXZ"&gt;The flip side of that is both phones have big, spacious displays. The Pixel 6’s is a 6.4-inch OLED panel with 1080p-wide resolution; the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch OLED screen with 1440p wide resolution. The Pixel 6’s screen is fully flat, while the 6 Pro has curved sides that taper into the frame. I prefer the flat screen of the 6, but the 6 Pro’s curves didn’t cause any errant touch issues in my testing, something that can make a curved screen difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjytBq"&gt;Both are sharp, vibrant, and colorful, with the 6 Pro being slightly brighter when outdoors in sunlight. Neither have any glaring problems that plagued older Pixel phones, like weird color reproduction or flickering at low brightness levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnzUBl"&gt;There are some issues if you look closely, like a slight color shift at oblique angles or a noticeable shadow under the curved sides of the 6 Pro when using a light background, things we don’t see on the best phones from Apple or Samsung at this point. If there’s one place where the cheaper price tag of these phones comes through, it’s these displays. They’re good, but not up to the level set by other flagship competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1p0VNe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The displays are good, but not quite the best we’ve seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O726Vq"&gt;They also have fast refresh rates — 90Hz on the Pixel 6, up to 120Hz on the 6 Pro — that make scrolling and interactions very smooth. Fast refresh screens have become table stakes on premium phones and it’s good to see Google follow suit here. I did not notice a difference between the 90Hz and 120Hz, either, unless I compared the phones side by side— both are smooth in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrcBYE"&gt;Less smooth is the fingerprint scanner under the screen. It’s located in a comfortable spot — about a quarter of the way up from the bottom — but it’s much slower than other fingerprint scanners, including the ones on the back of older Pixel phones. Because it’s optical, the screen lights up when you scan a finger, which can be really disruptive in dark rooms. The scanner also misread my finger from time to time, requiring multiple attempts to unlock the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6TiBM"&gt;Compounding this error is the fact that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro don’t have any sort of facial recognition unlock — the fingerprint scanner is the only biometric authentication available, and it’s just not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p3b7AYz9iBasM0ZPVmyUI3fNSso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934841/bfarsace_211014_4802_0054.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the regular Pixel 6 is still a very large phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="quBj6E"&gt;One of the most important things about the Pixel 6 pair is the processor inside of them, Google’s new Tensor chip. It’s the first custom processor from Google, which is following in Apple’s footsteps and leaving behind off-the-shelf processors from Qualcomm or MediaTek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyZqY4"&gt;In addition to powering the phone, the Tensor processor also has a lot of AI-based customization to enhance features in the camera, speech recognition, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oikAff"&gt;Google says the new processor is competitive with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 for performance, and in my experience, that’s true. Apps open quickly, it’s easy to switch between them smoothly, and the interface is free of stutters and hang-ups. Twitter was the one app that stuttered on both phones, but it was an outlier. The Tensor chip will not benchmark as highly as Apple’s latest processors, but it’s far ahead of the processor that was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5 last year&lt;/a&gt; and right up there with other premium Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1SiKk"&gt;The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro is equipped with 12GB. In practical use, the 6’s lesser amount of RAM did not present issues — streaming apps do not aggressively close in the background like they did on older Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dnc0I"&gt;There also wasn’t an appreciable difference in battery life between the two phones. Both are easily able to cruise through a full day of use with plenty of juice left in the tank — most nights I went to bed with 35-40 percent battery remaining, even while using the camera a lot and enabling the always-on display feature. Light users can probably stretch this to two days without much effort. A big reason for this stamina is the fact that the batteries are just big — big phones bring big batteries and big battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DznWh20KyWGOdtuMs_kwV9Aw8XY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934884/bfarsace_211014_4802_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint scanner is located about a quarter of the way up from the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2YtMAz"&gt;Both models support wireless charging and fast wired charging, but neither come with a charger in the box. Google sells a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger?hl=en-US"&gt;$25 30-watt brick&lt;/a&gt; separately and will be releasing a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US"&gt;$79 fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; in the near future, but I haven’t been able to test that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2oSGn"&gt;Even if you do use a powerful enough charger, neither phone charges particularly quickly. Google aggressively slows down charging once it’s past 80 percent to preserve the battery cells’ longevity, and since these batteries are so large, getting to a full charge can take a long time. Fortunately, thanks to the long battery life, you will likely only have to charge when you’re sleeping anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="02eeNC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google nailed the haptic feedback in the Pixel 6 — it’s clicky, but subtle, with just the right amount of feedback&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwjiZ1"&gt;Another area that the Pixels excel is in their haptic feedback. Bad, buzzy haptics can ruin a phone experience for me, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have subtle, clicky responses that provide just the right amount of feedback. It makes typing on the keyboard or interacting with the UI very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra4ls"&gt;Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have proper, dual stereo speakers that pump out a satisfactory amount of volume and sound clear for both streaming music or video and taking speakerphone or video calls. Good riddance to the vibrating screen pseudo-speaker Google used in the Pixel 5 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgK76L"&gt;Google is advertising 5G connectivity for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but the details around it aren’t quite that straightforward. The unlocked and T-Mobile versions of the Pixel 6 are limited to sub-6 5G, while the Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T models are more expensive and support the faster but very limited millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhM5Xy"&gt;None of that confusion applies to the Pixel 6 Pro — no matter how you buy it, it will support both sub-6 and mmWave 5G. AT&amp;amp;T’s extra cost for its model relative to the unlocked, T-Mobile, or Verizon versions just buys you the privilege of being an AT&amp;amp;T customer, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCyh7F"&gt;I tested unlocked versions of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro on Google Fi, which uses T-Mobile’s 5G network. Performance was commensurate with other premium phones I’ve used on T-Mobile — I was able to reach speeds of 300 to 400Mbps in certain areas of New York City, which is a lot faster than I get on LTE in the same areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQrh9lhcFjli9Nu9AT373ed2aQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957770/akrales_211020_4802_0323.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro is the first Google phone with a wide, ultrawide, and telephoto camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XEfWev"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro’s camera systems are also wholly new, with new sensors, new lenses, and new capabilities. Google has finally upgraded the camera hardware in the Pixel line for the first time since 2017, and it’s gone big — literally. The new main camera sensor is much larger than the one used in the Pixel 5 and earlier, and the Pixel 6 Pro is the first in the line to have ultrawide, wide, and telephoto cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="denxON"&gt;Both phones have the same main wide camera and ultrawide. The main camera is a 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images behind an optically stabilized f/1.85 lens. That means you can’t actually capture the full 50-megapixel resolution and the images produced aren’t especially sharper or more detailed than other 12-megapixel cameras, including the Pixel 5’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="MOp3xB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The telephoto camera on the Pixel 6 Pro is the most fun to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vHaSy"&gt;Still, the images are very good in both normal and low light, and very competitive with the best from Apple. I won’t say there’s a clear winner here; some images from the Pixel 6 look better, some images from the iPhone 13 Pro look better, and which you prefer really comes down to your own personal preferences, something we’ve been saying about smartphone cameras for a few years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvCow0"&gt;The Pixel 6 images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, slight overexposure, extreme sharpness, and cooler white balance. You can adjust the white balance easily enough using on-screen sliders in the camera app, but tweaking the sharpness requires a bit more post processing work. Google’s artificial portrait mode is also largely unchanged — it aggressively blurs the background to the point where it almost looks like the subject is a cardboard cutout placed in a diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQX8d"&gt;One area I would like Google to improve is how long its vaunted night mode takes to capture a shot. It’s incredible how much detail the night mode is able to capture in dark scenes, but it takes quite a few seconds to do so, and oftentimes either the subject or the person taking the photo loses patience and things get blurry. The iPhone’s night mode frequently took half as long to capture night scenes as the Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kAqCcN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10832288"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcbUgX"&gt;Overall, though, the advancements in image quality from the main camera are not as big as you might expect from new, significantly better hardware. Oftentimes, it’s hard to tell the difference between it and what you could get with older Pixel phones, especially in good lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtNigz"&gt;The Pixel 6’s ultrawide camera is its weakest link — images are soft, it’s not as wide as others, and there’s a noticeable difference in color and processing between it and the main camera. It also lacks the macro focusing abilities available on the iPhone 13 Pro’s ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUuZbc"&gt;On the other hand, the Pixel 6 Pro’s telephoto camera is excellent. It’s the first telephoto on a phone that I’ve actually enjoyed using and might be reason enough to spring for the 6 Pro over the regular 6. The 4x reach is noticeably longer than the 3x telephoto on the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s much more usable day to day than the 10x zoom on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwcarS"&gt;On top of that, the telephoto produces sharp, detailed images, with great subject separation that requires much less use of software-based portrait modes. It’s a lot of fun to shoot with and the kind of thing that changes what you can do with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ciG9v6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, a little overexposure, and lots of detail&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vc6GtC"&gt;Google says it has upgraded the Pixel 6’s video recording abilities, but it’s still behind the iPhone, which remains the standard. You can shoot 4K 60fps as long as you want without the phone overheating, but there’s still noticeable artifacting and wonkiness with image stabilization, and the video image processing is weirdly different from how the Pixel processes still images. Highly saturated colors, like reds and oranges, are amped up to the extreme in video, almost like how Samsung used to process colors years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLY2sT"&gt;On the front of the phones, the cameras differ — the Pixel 6 has an 8-megapixel camera with an 84-degree field of view, while the 6 Pro has an 11-megapixel camera with a 94-degree field of view. Not only will you fit more people in the 6 Pro’s frame, the image quality is noticeably better, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHozb87stxx869rcwgyj7_CQ6CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957782/akrales_211022_4802_0839.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Eraser feature in Google Photos makes it easy to remove unwanted people or objects in images, but it can be hit or miss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7my4c"&gt;The Tensor chip in the Pixel enables a couple of special software tricks in the camera and photos app. The new Magic Eraser tool lets you remove unwanted people or items from a captured photo with a single tap, or you can highlight things to remove. It’s very cool, but also hit or miss — it won’t be taking the place of any skilled Photoshop editors anytime soon. You can also accomplish similar things with third-party apps, so it’s not entirely necessary to buy a Pixel for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzdeVq"&gt;What’s more interesting to me are the new motion capture modes, which let you mimic a panning motion shot or a long exposure with just a single tap of the shutter button. You can make a moving object, like a car, freeze in front of a blurred background, or you can capture traffic light streaks without the need for a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EcJMb"&gt;These kinds of images typically take years of practice and lots of gear to do with a traditional camera, but the Pixel 6 makes it as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IgMtL_a_VAx4ipur-SOEIqYtJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957784/akrales_211022_4802_0876.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 makes capturing a panning shot as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KTok65"&gt;Google has also made a big deal about tweaks it made to its image processing algorithm this year to better handle darker skin tones, which it’s calling Real Tone. Bias in image processing is a problem that’s beset the photo industry for decades, dating all the way &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9348821/photography-race-bias"&gt;back to film&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s encouraging to see Google address it. Google says the Real Tone processing is baked into the Pixel’s image processing pipeline and it’s not possible to turn it on or off at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYolzl"&gt;Both Nicole Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-built-the-pixel-6-camera-to-better-portray-people-with-darker-skin-tones-does-it-11635177665?st=l805lxv5h4q9ve7&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Julian Chokkattu &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were able to test the camera with a range of darker skin tones and their conclusions are interesting; I encourage you to read their respective articles. Looking at all the photos, it’s clear the Pixel is still doing Pixel things: high contrast, with a dose of overexposure to compensate for that, and very sharp details. Some folks might like that look but not everyone will, even if you have darker skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D18tfaBTNzVe-giUTl3StbkE8bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957781/akrales_211022_4802_0822.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro show off Android 12 well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UeOAsn"&gt;As you’d expect with a new Pixel, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro run the latest version of Google’s Android, the completely redesigned Android 12. We’ve already done a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;full review of Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — I’ll just add that it feels like the fun and whimsy that’s missing from the hardware design of the new Pixels was reserved for the software. It’s colorful and easy to read, with a lot of personalization options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ewnmh"&gt;Also unsurprising, there are a number of Pixel-specific software features, including things that are improved by Google’s new Tensor chip. The Pixel 6 has better voice dictation transcription, since it can do it all locally now, and it can translate foreign languages in messages and media faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njVwf8sdV8dg2e4_3OByiOyCz20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962441/Screenshot_20211027_175036.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6’s ability to navigate an automated phone tree system is extremely clever but still needs work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XBTwB0"&gt;But the most impressive software features to me are found in the phone app. In addition to the spam routing features Google has had for a few years, the Pixel 6 can now help you with automated phone tree systems and tell you how long the wait time might be when you call a business. It can even wait on hold for you and then notify you when someone picks up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrG2iA"&gt;The automated phone tree feature will listen in on the call and transcribe the options presented, then give you big tappable buttons to make choices. It’s far easier than trying to listen to every word the system is saying only to miss something critical and have to wait for it to restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xd3qnx"&gt;But in testing, it’s clear this still needs work — it can’t recognize languages other than English (such as when you’re presented to “press two for Spanish”) and it often misses words and context that prevent it from giving you the right buttons on the screen to press. Still, it’s a novel idea and I hope Google continues to iterate and improve on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oIPds"&gt;Other additions are the ability to show boarding passes and other useful information right on the lock screen and support for select voice commands to the Assistant without having to say “Hey Google” first. It’s particularly convenient to just mumble “snooze” when an alarm goes off and have the phone obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gshBVdQBcXY-fsgw38qruMxCe5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957766/akrales_211020_4802_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qpBvGh"&gt;One of the biggest questions surrounding the Pixel 6 announcement has been, did Google do it? Has it actually been able to produce a competent, flagship-level smartphone that doesn’t have any show-stopping bugs or big gotchas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhsiQo"&gt;And the answer is a resounding yes, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are excellent phones. They may not be the best in every category, but as a whole, they perform well, have great screens, excellent cameras, and reliably great battery life. The only real hang-up here is the size — if you don’t like large phones, they probably aren’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UXrBhK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6 is an incredible phone for $600&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PI9Cff"&gt;Adding to their appeal is how much value is packed in. The Pixel 6 in particular is just a lot of phone for $600 — it’s hard to think of anything on the market that can compete with it at that price. Google is offering a better experience than basically any other Android phone maker in the markets where the Pixel is available, and often doing so for a lower price. It’s even undercutting OnePlus, which built its entire brand on selling premium phones for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Imbs6s"&gt;Does that mean lots of people will actually buy the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, when Google has long struggled to gain any market share? Frankly, I don’t really care, because those who do buy it will have a great phone at a great price. It’s hard to argue against that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="MiPiH4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10832275"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Duo 2 review: Duo-over or strike two?</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s second attempt at a folding phone rights a lot of the original’s wrongs, but doesn’t fix everything&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8WNgdd"&gt;Folding phones may be the future, but right now, they are still in their infancy. And in this weird time period where companies are still trying to figure out the best way for a folding phone to work, there are two camps: Samsung and others that fold a big screen down to a smaller, pocketable size, and Microsoft, which joins two screens with a hinge to create a digital book-like device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKhOjN"&gt;Microsoft’s first attempt at this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;2020’s Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;, was not very good. It had a head-turning design and plenty of &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; factor, but the original Duo was, to put it bluntly, a hot mess. It lacked modern smartphone things like a proper camera, 5G, wireless charging, NFC, and an up-to-date processor. Even worse, the software was buggy and frustrating to use, with frequent crashes, poor touch response, and limited compatibility in third-party apps for its unique dual-screen features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajnX77"&gt;For this year’s attempt, the $1,499.99-and-up Surface Duo 2, Microsoft appears to have righted many of the original’s wrongs. It has an up-to-date processor, refined design, bigger battery, 5G support, NFC support, newer software, and an actual, honest-to-goodness proper camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yILKfZ"&gt;But once you get past all of those spec-sheet corrections, the Duo 2 still suffers from many of the same issues that plagued the first model. This is still very much a work in progress, one that I can’t recommend anyone buying until Microsoft figures it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IgeCAI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10819327"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JlJxTL"&gt;The good thing about the Duo 2 is that it still has the original’s wow factor. This is just a flat-out cool-looking device and is almost sure to turn heads when used in public. The general design remains the same: it’s effectively two, full-size, super-thin smartphones joined by a 360-degree hinge. The two halves are slightly thicker than last year’s model, but they are still remarkably thin, and their added thickness makes the whole thing feel more substantial. It also offers room for a larger battery, which doesn’t have trouble reliably lasting me a day. Also, this year you can get it in white or black. My review unit is black, but I’m partial to the white model, which hides the fingerprints that collect on the glass much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOovoBL8HzRIsp3GwzKFyeGT5A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943436/dseifert_211017_4814_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2’s hinge is strong enough to hold the screens in any position you may need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7AopV"&gt;The hinge is very nice — it’s smooth yet firm, so it can hold its position however you want it, and it makes it easy to switch from using two screens to just a single screen. The sides of the screens that meet the hinge have a curve, making it possible to see them through the hinge when the Duo 2 is closed. Microsoft is taking advantage of that space to display  limited notifications (missed calls, messages, battery level, and volume level, but no third-party apps), but it’s still not as convenient as a screen on the outside of the phone would be. I’ve also pinched my fingers in the hinge when opening the phone numerous times due to the curve — I’m not hurt, just embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE1m65"&gt;The screens are slightly larger now — 5.8-inches each, effectively an 8.3-inch screen when combined — and they have a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother interactions and scrolling. They are still OLED panels, which provide punchy colors and deep blacks, and I didn’t have any issues viewing the screens outdoors in bright light. Their slightly larger size doesn’t actually make the footprint of the Duo 2 any larger than the first Duo — the unsightly bezels above and below the screens are now slightly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEyeO76_JYx9u2C3jEci_reM824=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943440/dseifert_211017_4814_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 is slightly thicker than last year’s model, but it’s still impressively thin when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twpiCUhtqW2j_cjVyOCknGRDDsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943432/dseifert_211017_4814_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve of the screens lets you see part of them through the hinge when it’s closed — Microsoft is using this to show limited notification information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gr1nrw"&gt;Yet the Duo 2’s unique two-screen design makes it a lot wider than normal smartphones. It’s harder to fit into a pocket, and it’s too wide to comfortably reach across the screen with your thumb. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; has an additional screen on the outside of the phone, and while that screen may be a little small for comfort, it’s a much easier device to use in one hand for quick tasks and fits in my pants pockets easier when it’s closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="cm8j1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Using the Duo 2 in one hand is far from an easy experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="27F9bp"&gt;The Duo 2 is just really hard to use quickly or with one hand — that’s the main takeaway here. It’s not the kind of phone you can whip out of your pocket to pay for something or snap a pic; everything is much more belabored. Using the NFC chip to buy a snack with Google Pay requires opening the phone, unlocking it, folding the left screen back, and then tapping the phone on the reader. It’s not exactly fluid, but hey, last year’s model didn’t even have an NFC chip, so baby steps it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7apeZ"&gt;Microsoft made some other small but obvious tweaks to the external hardware. The fingerprint scanner is now integrated into the power button and the USB-C charging port is centered on the right half of the phone, which might be easier to use with certain charging docks. Sadly, the Duo 2 still doesn’t support wireless charging, which is an unfortunate omission at this price. It also doesn’t have any sort of water or dust resistance rating, something that Samsung has been able to add to its folding phones this year. You’ll want to be careful — that’s a lot of phone that can’t get wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83i3Vr"&gt;Last year’s Duo had a lousy, single speaker; the Duo 2 now has a louder, clearer dual-speaker system. It makes watching video more enjoyable and it’s easier to hear speaker phone or video calls, but the speakers are not nearly as nice as the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hov0QerFOj92l9Y6e8RGeeRGCAU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943445/dseifert_211017_4814_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can write notes on one screen while reviewing a website or document on the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P8PNN5"&gt;The Duo 2 works with Microsoft’s various Surface Pens (sold separately), including the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pen Slim 2&lt;/a&gt;, for pen input. It doesn’t support the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710381/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-hands-on"&gt;Pen 2’s haptics&lt;/a&gt;, like you get with the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, but the writing experience with the new pen is much better than it was with the older models. The company is also selling a case that covers the front of the Duo 2 and lets you store and charge the Slim Pen or Slim Pen 2 through a magnetic attachment. The magnet is strong — the pen isn’t going to just fall off — but you do have to be careful when sliding the phone into a pocket to not dislodge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUYLf7"&gt;Unsurprisingly, pen input works best with Microsoft’s own OneNote and Sticky Notes apps. In other apps like Evernote, palm rejection and inking is not as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="niPOjU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Duo 2 has a camera system that the original lacked entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lyXtB8"&gt;The last big new hardware feature is the new triple-camera system on the back of the right screen. It’s comprised of a 12-megapixel, f/1.7 wide angle; 16-megapixel, f/2.2 ultrawide; and a 12-megapixel, f/2.4 2x telephoto camera. There are night and portrait modes and you can shoot 4K video up to 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aZ6Na"&gt;The camera housing sticks out from the back of the phone, like many other phone cameras do, which gets in the way when you try to fold back the left side and use just the right screen. So Microsoft cleverly angled the housing so the left screen sits flush against it. It doesn’t fold as flat as the first Duo in this position, but this is a fine compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WLUWR"&gt;Microsoft is also using the two screens to its advantage in the camera app to show you captured images on the left and your framing on the right. It’s easy to quickly see a full-size image right after you take it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoFS_G_J8RRDIZ0mklpFteaPl_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943429/dseifert_211017_4814_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 now has an actual camera system, but its output is not very good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G67ZEj"&gt;But beyond that, there aren’t many positive things to say about this camera. For starters, because of the Duo’s design, you can’t take pics without opening the phone fully, and it’s very awkward to try to do it one-handed. The camera also hunts for focus a lot, is slow to capture images, and is generally just not very pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMmz2v"&gt;Image quality is a low point, too. Pictures are over-sharpened and flat, low-light images have lots of watercolor noise reduction and little detail. While it’s certainly an upgrade to the complete lack of a proper camera system in the first Duo, the Duo 2’s camera is hardly competitive with phones at its price point or even hundreds of dollars less. Google’s $500 Pixel 5A runs laps around this camera for a third of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TPvwV6fTcOJqUgFAvRvLLh61QuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943437/dseifert_211017_4814_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on the Duo 2 is easier than on just about any other phone you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jie2Tb"&gt;Despite those frustrations with the hardware, there are absolutely some cool things you can do with the Duo 2’s unique form factor. The two screens make it far easier to run two apps at the same time compared to split-screen modes on other phones or iPads. You literally just open one app on one screen and the second on the other and boom, you’re in multitasking bliss. I was able to call in to a Zoom meeting on one screen and follow along in a Google Doc on the other screen without missing a beat or feeling like I should have taken the call from my laptop. I can easily see my calendar when I’m responding to an email asking for a meeting, or I can mainline two social media feeds at the same time when doomscrolling through one just isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01PJQy"&gt;Those are all things you can do on other phones or tablets, but the Duo 2 makes it much easier to multitask in that fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dms7ph"&gt;There are limits to what you can do. Neither Microsoft’s own Edge browser nor Chrome allow you to open two websites side by side, so if you want to compare two sites, you have to use two browsers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j5l9n"&gt;You can “span” a single app across the two screens, but the apps that work best in that mode are primarily made by Microsoft, like Outlook, OneNote, and the Office suite. Most Android apps will just stretch themselves across the screens in an unsightly way, with a giant gap in the middle where the hinge is. Video is particularly bad when spanned across the two screens — you’ll want to stick to turning the phone on its side and just watching something on one of the screens in landscape. You can easily tent the phone to prop it up on a table or desk — no extra kickstand needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RmCzJBwaMQycJazUrCvzVonog3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943438/dseifert_211017_4814_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watching a video across two screens means dealing with a big gap in the middle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GKyA8a"&gt;Microsoft smartly worked with Amazon and Google to support the Kindle and Play Books apps on the dual screens, so when you span them you get one page on each screen, a digital facsimile of a book. A new feature in the Duo 2’s software (which Microsoft says will eventually be coming to the original Duo) is the ability to set an app to auto span every time you open it — so whenever I open the Kindle app, it automatically takes over both screens. It’s perhaps my favorite thing to do with a Duo and is more enjoyable to use than an actual Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qU4jR4"&gt;The original Duo launched with Android 10 and had countless bugs. Many months later, it has received numerous updates, but it’s still on Android 10 and still has many of the same bugs. (Microsoft says it will get Android 11 before the end of this year.) The Duo 2 is launching with Android 11 and the company promises three years of updates, including monthly bug fixes and security patches. But it stops short of committing to a specific number of Android OS platform updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y8vbc"&gt;The software on the Duo 2 is undeniably better than it was on the original at launch, and even where the first model is today after many bug fix updates. It’s faster, likely thanks to the Duo 2’s newer processor and more generous amount of RAM, and it’s more reliable and predictable. It has more features, like the aforementioned auto spanning mode and hinge notifications, plus basic quality of life things like automatic dark mode and night light modes for the display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKN_vzo7fu4EtEDLhN_K5haQpIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943448/dseifert_211017_4814_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading ebooks is one of the best experiences on the Duo 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5EDpb"&gt;But it’s still in rough shape in a lot of ways and feels incomplete. The biggest issue by far is a familiar one to the Duo line: poor touch response. A lot of my taps on the screen just aren’t registered — I have to hit an icon twice to launch an app or send a message. Typing on the keyboard is particularly frustrating as a not-small percentage of my taps are ignored, slowing me down greatly. Even when writing with the pen, the screen will miss strokes, making my already bad handwriting look even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dWFNI"&gt;Microsoft says it has not seen these issues itself, but I spoke to a number of other reviewers who have been testing the Duo 2 and they all shared my experience. It’s baffling that such a core experience on a touch-based device isn’t flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQ9Kgd"&gt;There are other features missing, like tap to wake when the phone is open, or any sort of always-on display. Maybe those features don’t always make sense on the Duo 2’s form factor, but they are just more examples of things you give up, like easy one-handed use, in order to have a device like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9S2zTEJ1pIDldjCQRc7iCZwe60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943428/dseifert_211017_4814_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2’s new black color option is very glossy and very fingerprint magnet-y.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FSR7Jb"&gt;It’s easy to see the potential in the Surface Duo line. You can dream up all kinds of different ways you’d put two screens to use, get more work done, and live in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BruA6D"&gt;But it doesn’t take long for those dreams to come crashing down to reality. Between the bugs and inherent awkwardness of the form factor, the Duo 2 is just a difficult device to live with day to day, much like its predecessor. Despite Microsoft addressing many of the omissions of the first generation — a proper camera, NFC, dual speakers, 5G, current processor — the Duo 2 still feels like a secondary device, something you carry alongside your primary phone for taking pictures, paying for things, and general phone stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="okKIaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Duo 2 is far from the one device to rule them all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGpXYL"&gt;If you do want a futuristic device that straddles the line between phone and tablet and has pen input, you’ll be better off with the Samsung Galaxy Fold 3, which has a better multimedia experience; can be used easier in one hand; and far fewer bugs. Or maybe you just wait, after all, this segment is still very much in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggL8Zm"&gt;At $1,500-plus, everything about the Surface Duo 2 is a tall ask. You could accomplish much of the same with an iPad Mini alongside your phone for a third of the price. If the first Surface Duo felt like it was 50 percent complete, the Duo 2 is perhaps maybe 75 percent of the way there. I can see the potential. But it does not live up to it, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
