    <title>Motorola Moto G Power (2021) review: power over perks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The G Power’s massive battery lasts for days, but other features have suffered to make way for it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N2DVeg"&gt;The Motorola Moto G Power is a $200 phone that does exactly what it claims — powers you through multiple days of use — but don’t expect any other bells or whistles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WilRjv"&gt;Battery is this phone’s whole deal. Its 5,000mAh battery is about as big as they come right now; it’s the same capacity you’ll find in top-of-the-line devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Rather than making a more well-rounded phone, Motorola has pared back features here and there — a low-res screen, a slower processor — and gone all-in on its headline feature. Cheaper components allow Motorola to sell a $200 version of this phone, and they’re also less power-hungry, making the absolute most of that massive battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27KtjE"&gt;This device bears the same name as its predecessor from last year, but it differs in a few key ways. Rather than offering one model, this year the G Power is offered in the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Silver/dp/B08NWDMR9N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aforementioned $200 variant&lt;/a&gt; with 3GB of RAM and a paltry 32GB of storage. There is also a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage option available for $250 (I tested the 32GB version). This year’s models drop the ultrawide camera and gain a slightly larger screen — 6.6-inch compared to 6.4-inch — with a lower 720p resolution than last year’s 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6TH6s"&gt;If you choose to buy the Moto G Power, it will hold up its end of the bargain. The question is whether you can live with the significant sacrifices Motorola has made to get the biggest possible battery into the most affordable phone it could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQXgVP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10333144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-brPctpoFkMIqYPDnfvL1B3Wmck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290841/ajohnson_210205_4399_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6.6-inch display offers a relatively low resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TNamvm"&gt;Moto G Power screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PChwmX"&gt;The Moto G Power has a 6.6-inch LCD with 720p resolution. That’s not much resolution to stretch across a fairly large screen, and it shows. Images aren’t quite as sharp as they could be, and the screen overall looks a little dim and washed out to me. The phone itself is on the big side, though I find it a bit more comfortable to use one-handed than the slightly larger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"&gt;6.7-inch Motorola One 5G Ace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9ku8bj"&gt;The G Power uses a Snapdragon 662 processor, and I felt the difference between this and the performance from a 700-series step-up chipset. It’s an extra beat slower jumping between apps and opening the camera. It requires more time to capture and process images in Portrait and Night Vision modes than the Ace does with the same main camera sensor. And heavier tasks like jumping in and out of Google Maps navigation shows noticeable stuttering. That said, you’ll be hard-pressed to find substantially better performance at the $200 price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RKyNWiILXnlRn8Rg89S4p3h9bfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290843/ajohnson_210205_4399_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Power offers biometric unlocking by way of a fingerprint sensor on the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rlQMbm"&gt;Bottom line, the Power handles day-to-day tasks, plays videos, and navigates adequately. I just felt myself noticing the delays as I was using the phone, which over the course of a day added up to a less than satisfying experience. But for a $200 phone, it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ESar"&gt;The G Power offers expandable storage by way of a microSD card slot, which feels necessary here. On the 32GB version I tested, 14GB of that storage is already occupied by Android 10 files. That’s simply not enough in 2021. You can pay $50 more for the 64GB model, but that also feels like spending too much to get too little. If you buy this phone, budget for a microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUGhmK"&gt;Motorola will offer an upgrade to Android 11 and says it will provide security updates for the G Power until January 2023. By then, years of updates will probably be slowing the phone down even more anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="14HxdS"&gt;Moto G Power battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oFQ9yX"&gt;The Moto G Power delivers on its headline feature. I started on Monday with a fully charged battery. I watched an episode of &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;, you know, for testing. I navigated across town and back. I scrolled through Instagram... a lot. Email, web browsing, rinse and repeat; by day three of moderate use, I was only down to 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnXkSG"&gt;Even after a trip outside of the house with a lot of picture-taking, I’m going on day four with a battery at 26 percent with just under six hours of screen-on time. I have charged my personal phone at least three times during this time span. We’ve been through roughly 12 news cycles. I myself have aged at least two years. But the Moto G Power carries on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ESF7d9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have charged my personal phone at least three times during this time span&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lYzJ1P"&gt;No doubt the slightly slower processor and low-powered screen help boost those numbers. I left the screen at its default brightness while I tested it, which is just a little dimmer than I’d prefer. It certainly doesn’t look &lt;em&gt;overly &lt;/em&gt;bright at its maximum setting, so an additional hit on battery life is something to take into account if you like a bright screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NJsxN"&gt;Bear in mind that I spent a good chunk of that time at home on Wi-Fi, which is easier on the battery. During non-pandemic times, I would have spent more time out of the house on cell data. And six hours of screentime doesn’t exactly make me a power user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nia2QJ"&gt;If you do spend more time on data and do more power-hungry tasks like watch a lot of videos, you’d probably be looking at more like two full days. In any case, Motorola’s claim of up to three days of battery life is entirely reasonable, and you might do even better than that if you spend the bulk of your time on Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wmtbxb979it3GBV4NpdMOLpuSkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290839/ajohnson_210205_4399_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameras on the Moto G Power include a standard wide, ultrawide, and a depth sensor for portrait mode photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eIrKqL"&gt;Moto G Power Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gk9Doj"&gt;The G Power offers a 48-megapixel main camera that produces 12-megapixel images, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a depth sensor to help create portrait mode photos. There’s also an 8-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXgBlW"&gt;The G Power uses the same main camera as the One 5G Ace, and similarly it takes nice photos in good light. It judges exposure well and captures plenty of detail, especially with close subjects. When its AI recognizes a scene like a landscape, colors look appropriately vibrant, but otherwise it tends toward flat, washed-out colors. In less good lighting conditions, things get a little messier where noise reduction smears a lot of detail. In high-contrast scenes where the camera has brightened shadows, there’s a fair amount of noise and / or noise reduction visible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zw3ol7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gYLMCB"&gt;As with the Ace, Night Vision tends to produce a washed-out looking image and in this case, it requires both you and your subject to hold still for several seconds. There’s some noticeable shutter lag in all photo modes — enough to make you wonder for a split second if you actually tapped the shutter button — and the display is laggy when panning around in portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnOGxD"&gt;This camera is just okay, and that’s fine for a $200 phone. The Moto G Power doesn’t have the processing power to pull off more sophisticated HDR or low light photography — for that you’d need to step up to the $350 Pixel 4A. It also won’t be able to keep up with fast subjects, or even slow-moving subjects in low light, but that’s often a struggle for phones priced well above $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hqir7WeU1PEDah-vnyS6jq-17w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290838/ajohnson_210205_4399_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Power makes good on its promise of multiday battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PL6gw6"&gt;If you’re on a strict budget and long battery life is a necessity, then look no further than the Moto G Power. However, I hesitate to recommend it to someone who doesn’t meet that description. You will be making sacrifices in order to get that $200 price and multiday battery life. The base storage is way too anemic and the speed is noticeably pokey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5KJid"&gt;If you have some flexibility in your budget, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$300 OnePlus N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; is a great upgrade pick with a better processor and camera. A bit more than that would get you a Pixel 4A with an excellent camera and a well-supported device with better longevity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GD1Vfm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Be aware of its limitations and pack a little patience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sdfsHk"&gt;If $200 is the limit of your budget, the G Power is a fine pick — more so because there are few other options at this price. In addition to its dayslong battery life, it has a better processor than the $100-150 competition and you’re unlikely to find a substantially better screen or camera at this price. Just be aware of its limitations and pack a little patience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola One 5G Ace review: a weak hand</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Ace offers a large screen and massive battery, but it falls short in some key areas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9iZybh"&gt;The Motorola One 5G Ace is a $399.99 phone that does a somewhat convincing impression of a more expensive phone. It’s large, which feels like a flagship kind of thing, even if that’s not strictly true. It’s relatively heavy, which, in keeping with the wisdom of &lt;a href="https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Donald_Gennaro"&gt;Jurassic Park’s unluckiest lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, means it’s probably expensive. It’s &lt;em&gt;shiny&lt;/em&gt;. I held it up for a friend to look at it from six feet away, and he described it as “sleek, like an old iPhone.” And of course, there’s 5G, which was (until somewhat recently) reserved for premium devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEL40T"&gt;It makes a great first impression, but once you look closer, you start to see where it lacks the polish of a high midrange or flagship phone. Its processor stumbles with heavy tasks, that big screen lacks the resolution or faster refresh rate commonly found on high-end devices, and its cameras can’t compete with the best. As is so often the case, you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50HpoH"&gt;Though $400 is affordable by 5G phone standards, it’s still more expensive than quite good non-5G alternatives. The Ace is one or two hundred dollars more than other capable budget options — some of which even offer 5G, too. The question, as always, is what compromises did Motorola make to offer this phone at $400, and are those acceptable trade-offs for someone considering it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v9LXdU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10309889"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oODc6g"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XLDGGB"&gt;The One 5G Ace features a generous 6.7-inch screen. Depending on how you feel about big phones, that might be one of this device’s best selling points. Battery is another strength: the Ace is equipped with a 5,000mAh battery (likely a contributor to its big size), which is head and shoulders above the 4,000 or 4,500mAh capacity typical in budget and midrange phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YVNuTxdHvjlfBf3XF0FWmyDay20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264374/ajohnson_210126_4384_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is a little big for my comfort, but your mileage may vary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fo0JnB"&gt;The Ace is a large phone that makes itself known; you won’t forget it’s in your pocket, for example. It’s a hair taller and wider than the Galaxy S21 Ultra and 1mm thicker. It’s on the heavier side, too, at 212g, probably owing to the battery. I found its size a little awkward. It feels like a strain to reach my thumb across the screen with the phone in one hand. I also fumbled it a couple of times, picking it up too quickly and forgetting how much it weighs. This is very likely a Me Problem, though; my husband thinks it’s comfortable to hold one-handed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EADeFo"&gt;The screen is a 1080 x 2400 LCD panel with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It’s bright and viewable even in direct sunlight, but it lacks the nice contrast of OLED. Viewing it from slightly off angles results in a loss of contrast and slight color shift. Its resolution is stretched a bit thin on a screen this size, and if you’ve had higher-resolution phones before, you will probably notice it doesn’t look quite as crisp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErZaMtcrsEMzaXGUK-65WadTXZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264375/ajohnson_210126_4384_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is just shy of 10mm thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGWov3"&gt;Likewise with refresh rate: quick scrolling motions and animations are just a little choppy, particularly if you’ve used a 90Hz or 120Hz screen. If you &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; switching from a phone with better resolution or a faster refresh rate, you won’t feel like you’re missing out on anything, and you’ll probably just appreciate what is a very large, pleasant-to-use screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLXEjj"&gt;With moderate use, I generally got two days out of the Ace’s huge battery. Gaming or watching a lot of videos would cut that down, but it’s hard to imagine a real-world scenario where you wouldn’t get at least a day and then some on a full charge. A 15W fast-ish charger is included in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV6i49"&gt;The Ace uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G 5G chipset. It had no problem handling my daily scrolling through Twitter and Instagram, and it generally felt pretty snappy cruising through Zillow and starting the camera. It struggles with certain heavier tasks, like using certain JavaScript features on a webpage (image sliders on this site, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LDD5_Td1ze13qj_6zYeiK5Z8fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264376/ajohnson_210126_4384_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll still find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Ace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ERYS1M"&gt;The Ace is offered with either 4GB of RAM / 64GB of storage or 6GB of RAM / 128GB storage, both of which are expandable via microSD card. I tested the 6GB of RAM variant. Overall, it feels like an appropriate amount of processing power for a $400 phone. The rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is quick and mask-friendly as a bonus, and the Ace includes a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgXUTT"&gt;Then there’s 5G. Worth noting: the Ace supports Sub-6GHz 5G only, which is the more widespread “nationwide” variety. We still have complicated feelings about the state of 5G in the US, but carriers are pouring resources into expanding and improving their existing 5G offerings. In that sense, choosing a phone that supports it now will mean your device is future-proofed for what 5G brings in the next couple of years. Don’t expect a night-and-day difference just yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DyAF-s3c3YanHVVaQBCo__kND_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264370/ajohnson_210126_4384_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear camera bump includes a wide, ultrawide, macro, and a flash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cDUkfP"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CHlusT"&gt;Motorola has equipped the Ace with three rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel standard wide that kicks out 12-megapixel images, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDnzjV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EftzLm"&gt;Motorola also throws in a handful of useful software features. There’s an optional on-screen level, which I appreciate as a serial crooked photo-taker. You can opt for a very wide-format image using the main camera, turning the entire screen into a giant viewfinder, which is a fun creative exercise. There’s also a Pro mode if you want to take control of more settings. I didn’t use it much, partly because its insistence on displaying live Kelvin color temperature values stressed me out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8L3li"&gt;Like most others in this class, the Ace takes nice photos in good lighting conditions. I like its handling of color and white balance. Food looks appetizing, and it handles mixed lighting well. Overall, when it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDCdIc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10308631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDp3lc"&gt;The Ace, unfortunately, does not always stay in its lane. Often, it tries to do too much with too little. In some high-contrast ultrawide shots, I saw a lot of noise where it tried to boost shadows — noticeable color noise like I haven’t seen since I was reviewing point-and-shoot cameras [redacted] years ago. Night Vision mode produces a very bright image that just looks strangely artificial and overcooked. Ultrawide photos in anything less than bright outdoor light look very smoothed-over from noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjlxAU"&gt;There’s also some noticeable shutter lag, which would definitely bother someone trying to photograph a moving subject like a child. It was more of a minor annoyance in my particular use cases of sleeping cat and street scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEGzx6"&gt;Even images taken in standard photo mode with the main camera look overworked with close inspection. The camera captures a good amount of detail, but sharpening can be aggressive and crunchy. A photo I took of the sunrise in my backyard was spoiled by some noticeable halo-ing around dark subjects in the foreground. If the Ace had just exposed for the sky and let shadows be, it would have been fine! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCMkdW"&gt;To be clear, it’s not a problem that a $400 phone can’t do all of the things the Ace is trying to do; it’s just that it probably shouldn’t try in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWgMCo"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wjLxPl"&gt;The Ace ships with Android 10, and an update to 11 has been promised. That’s the only major platform update you’ll get. Beyond that, Motorola will provide two years of security updates, up until January 2023. Motorola is, unfortunately, behind the curve by offering just one major update, even for a budget device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tT8xW"&gt;Motorola’s take on Android includes customizable home screen fonts, icon shapes, and colors, along with a couple of annoying pre-downloaded apps that can be hidden but not uninstalled. I like Moto’s handling of lock screen notifications, or “peek notifications” as it calls them. They’re helpful without being intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHOMy-SW8fE2606yTkwIu8RppVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264368/ajohnson_210126_4384_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace doesn’t have a lot of direct competition as a $400 phone with 5G, but that will change soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WRppA1"&gt;“You get what you pay for” is an appropriate takeaway here, and I mean that in both a cautionary and a complimentary sense. Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience. But for $400, you should expect to get a phone that will get you through your day without giving you trouble. It should do the things you need it to do — even some things you &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;it to do — and it should see you through a couple of years at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9fTv0"&gt;The One 5G Ace meets all of those requirements, even though it does fall short of good midrange and high-end devices. Though capable, its processor can’t quite hang with the best of them. The camera is a little clumsy. The screen, while plenty big and bright, isn’t going to offer the rich viewing experience of a competing device with an OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PYhLKg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYk6z9"&gt;For now, the Ace doesn’t have much direct 5G-capable competition for $400, but that will change quickly. If you plan to hang on to your phone for the next couple of years, it does make sense to pick a 5G model now. For a bit more, the $460 Google Pixel 4A 5G offers a superior camera, a nicer screen, and a slightly better processor. Or you could save some money and get the $300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G with a 90Hz screen that’s almost as big and a better camera, though it offers a less powerful processor. If it’s an option, you could wait things out for a few months. More affordable 5G devices are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="99Njdr"&gt;I don’t have a problem recommending the Motorola One 5G Ace if — and it’s an important &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; — a large screen and great battery are priorities for you above all else. But if you think you’ll want a better camera or a nicer screen, it would be best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The processor is updated. The rest? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="kH6i08"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a midrange phone with a flagship name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9QQQa"&gt;Rather than offer essentially the same top-tier phone at different sizes, Samsung has chosen to get aggressive on price this year. The Galaxy S21 starts at $799.99 for the smaller version with a 6.2-inch screen and $999.99 for the Plus version with a 6.7-inch display. Though in both cases, the smart move is to spend an extra $50 for the models with 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84zXoV"&gt;It helps that the S21 happens to be a very good midrange phone. Nevertheless, Samsung’s choices this year mean if you want to get the very best phone Samsung has to offer right now, you have to buy the very &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="em9jN5"&gt;If the Ultra is too big or too expensive for your needs, there’s nothing wrong with the regular Galaxy S21. Samsung has managed to cut the price without major sacrifices in either the experience or the features of this phone. However, avoiding massive failure isn’t necessarily the same thing as achieving great success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x6MAv8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10305775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZyXbMNC2UhUwsWa7wUsSa3j4ymE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258903/vpavic_210118_4378_0213.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="U6duVZ"&gt;The phones that aim to give you the best of everything tend to cost more than a thousand dollars. Below that, there are more noticeable trade-offs as each phone picks its priority. For the Galaxy S21, Samsung put its big bet behind just one part: the processor, Qualcomm’s high-end Snapdragon 888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQcPkZ"&gt;In some markets outside the US, Samsung is using its own Exynos processor, and though I’ve heard Samsung has significantly improved it over last year’s, I haven’t been able to test it myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9duJp"&gt;On a basic level, prioritizing the processor means the S21 is a very fast phone with decent battery life. I am able to get through a full day with moderate to heavy use on the 4,000mAh battery, though with a little effort, I can drain it down. The bigger Galaxy S21 Plus — which I haven’t tested — has a 4,800mAh battery and presumably will last even longer despite its slightly larger screen. Both share the same resolution and features otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CArd0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung prioritized putting in a fast new processor above all else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BaaoF"&gt;Just as importantly, the choice to go with the newest and best Qualcomm processor means the Galaxy S21 has a better chance of lasting you three or more years before the inevitable march of Android software bogs it down or leaves it behind. I’ve asked Samsung how many years of software updates it will guarantee for S21 users and will update this review if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hci2fC"&gt;The Snapdragon 888 also means these phones support both kinds of 5G in the US. In my testing in the Bay Area, I still find that 5G often isn’t notably faster than LTE, and the mmWave version of 5G is still very difficult to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC4Rgl"&gt;However, I can also see some improvements over last year. My take on 5G has therefore shifted a bit. I still think that you should not upgrade your phone just to get 5G. However, if you’re due for an upgrade &lt;em&gt;anyway&lt;/em&gt; and you have the choice of getting a 5G phone, you probably should. The networks aren’t good enough yet, but if you’re keeping your phone for a while, you may regret not having it in the years to come. (It’ll be hard to buy a phone without 5G if you’re spending over $500 this year, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6m15bRQ0zZPq-LpOuRYucVqEJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258912/vpavic_210118_4378_0178.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FYZdAW"&gt;To go along with the priority you can’t see, Samsung’s other big change is the thing you can: the design. As with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, the regular Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have metal rails that flow into the camera bump on the back. It looks as good here as it does on the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri1l39"&gt;However, Samsung went a step further on the smaller S21 by swapping out the usual rear glass panel with plastic (the Plus model still uses glass). It’s not a problem for me at all — in fact, in some ways, I prefer it as it’s one less thing that is able to shatter in a fall. It’s a way to cut costs, but one that makes me wonder whether I really want glass on the back of my phone in the first place. It feels great, with a matte finish and none of the cheap or flimsy associations plastic can bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s screen is only 1080p, but it’s flat and looks great" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FuVCp4MuSJ0RkXiPvwGD4OYIVlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258907/vpavic_210118_4378_0197.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s screen is only 1080p, but it’s flat and looks great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6VFHY1LDByk6XWrM61fGMp0iMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258895/vpavic_210119_4378_0238.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back of the base model is plastic, but it feels good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are three cameras on the back of the S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHnAtkSkPbgdAwQ2MqqUqDLYrF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258897/vpavic_210119_4378_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three cameras on the back of the S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKrLXB"&gt;While we’re on the subject, here are some of the other ways Samsung has cut costs on the S21 compared to last year’s Galaxy S20. It lacks MST, Samsung’s tech for paying at credit card terminals that can’t read NFC. There is no microSD card slot for expanding the storage, which stings a bit as Samsung was a bit of a holdout in keeping the microSD card around in its flagships until recently. Samsung also saved costs by standing pat with the cameras — they’re virtually unchanged from last year. (More on the cameras below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAqGCX"&gt;The S21 also drops the screen resolution down from last year’s 1440p panel to 1080p on both the regular and Plus versions. They’re flat, too, which many people prefer to curved edges. I don’t mind curved screens so long as they fit with the ergonomics of the phone, but here, I think Samsung made the right call to go flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp1mQ5"&gt;The screen has an adaptive refresh rate that can run at up to 120Hz, so scrolling and animations are very smooth. Unlike the Ultra’s more advanced screen technology, this screen’s refresh rate bottoms out at 48Hz, and it also uses more traditional OLED tech instead of the newer LTPO version in the Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jan4WZ"&gt;To those screen spec downgrades, I say this: whatever. Samsung is consistently great at making screens, and even though the S21 doesn’t showcase the company at its best, it’s still a great display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3BVXO"&gt;But more than any other upgrade or downgrade this year, the spec that had the most tangible effect on my experience with the S21 was the new fingerprint sensor under the screen. It can read from a larger area, and to me, it feels faster than last year’s sensor did. For as often as we unlock our phones, even milliseconds make a difference in how responsive the phone feels. Also: it works with masks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldH3g-82fT_EWqT4iskr_P52nFo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258892/vpavic_210122_4378_0249.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21’s camera hardware is essentially unchanged from last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Zphw1m"&gt;The only substantive difference between the camera systems on last year’s Galaxy S20 and this year’s Galaxy S21 isn’t in the hardware, but the software. Samsung has done some work to update its processing to improve photos in certain situations. I’ve noticed a small jump in low-light quality, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iesJXT"&gt;But outside a minor sensor swap on the ultrawide, the camera hardware is unchanged. The main sensor is 12 megapixels with OIS, the ultrawide is also 12 megapixels and has a 120-degree field of view, and the telephoto has a 3x optical zoom and does crop tricks with its 30-megapixel sensor to offer digital zoom up to 30X. The selfie camera is 10 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWFqPT"&gt;In the US, I think the most direct camera competitor in this price range is probably the $699 Google Pixel 5. Much to my surprise, the consensus among reviewers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is that the Galaxy S21 takes better photos overall. I agree. The Pixel’s long-standing camera advantage has all but dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IE4UjG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10305812"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXtk4E"&gt;Now, I still prefer the Pixel’s aesthetics to Samsung’s. The Pixel keeps its contrast-y, bluer look compared to Samsung’s tendency to over-brighten and oversaturate everything. However, on a technical level, the Galaxy S21 just does a better job. There’s less noise in shadows and low light, more detail in decent light, and much better zoom performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbSmBB"&gt;Don’t think the regular Galaxy S21 stands up to the superior telephoto images you can get from the Ultra, which has a 10X optical lens. But at zoom levels from 3X to the Pixel’s maximum of 7X, the S21 simply does a better job than Google’s algorithms. Samsung also wins on video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Szqb2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10305816"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yGvL4"&gt;There is the usual array of new camera features, many of which I think most users can ignore. Shooting 8K video doesn’t make much sense on a camera of this caliber, but you can do it. I do appreciate Samsung’s Pro modes for both video and photos, though. In situations where you’re able to spend a little time composing your shot and adjusting the camera settings, you can get something much more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlgR6d"&gt;Samsung has also made it possible to turn off face smoothing completely. It makes for better images, but more importantly, it might also help &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497587/google-pixel-phone-selfie-beauty-filter-retouching-camera"&gt;make for a better self-image&lt;/a&gt; for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fzsUmpelPMwTxNytg_CUH6t3GI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258901/vpavic_210119_4378_0228.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s One UI software on the Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="X9ND6z"&gt;As I noted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;in my review of the Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is heading in the wrong direction with its software. It’s a shame because the fundamentals of Samsung’s version of Android, One UI, are still great. It makes Android feel a little cleaner and brighter and gives it key features to help manage gigantic screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Iz3Go"&gt;But instead of building on that strength, Samsung is bogging it down. There are too many arcane settings and too many nearly meaningless icons in the quick settings panel. In the US, S21 users will have to be savvy enough to know to download and use Android Messages instead of Samsung Messages if they want unfettered, unbroken access to RCS messaging (most of the rest of the world gets Android Messages by default). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q0JNaz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One UI still has the right fundamentals but is heading in the wrong direction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ziztFW"&gt;Also, Samsung’s digital assistant, Bixby, is only worth using if you’ve connected the rest of your digital life to Samsung’s ecosystem. I suspect most in the US have not, and so the whole thing just seems redundant next to Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxUqcd"&gt;Most egregiously of all, Samsung’s default apps often have ads at the top. Tapping the gigantic weather widget at the top of the default home screen reveals an ad in Samsung’s weather app. I don’t know what tiny marginal profit Samsung makes from these ads, but I don’t think the hit to its reputation is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5xTyl"&gt;All of these hassles with Samsung’s software can either be avoided or undone by a knowledgeable user. And in general, I think most users will find their way to that knowledge — but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a hassle in the first place. I can be more productive on a well-configured Samsung phone than on virtually any other phone, but it shouldn’t require this much configuration and ad-dodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuDtdwJTwbMBxwvpw_1cGz7AwFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t8u2Le"&gt;Add up all of the choices and components in the Galaxy S21, and you can’t avoid the conclusion that it is a rehashed Galaxy S20 with a faster processor and a nicer exterior. That’s a fairly dour way of looking at it, but it is the truth, and I don’t think it should damn the phone. Sometimes the year-over-year updates are minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eSqdNI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung brought the price down, but you should wait for carriers to discount it even further&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qF1o2d"&gt;That minor update means there’s little reason to rush out to buy the Galaxy S21. It’s a phone to get when you need to replace your old and busted phone, and if your phone is more than a couple of years old, it’ll make a huge difference. There’s another reason not to rush out to get the S21: Samsung’s phones are famous for getting deep discounts from carriers. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it would be a mistake to pay full price for an S21, but I would say you should look — or even wait — for a deal if you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MnS8u"&gt;The most interesting choice Samsung made this year is instead of making a lower-cost “Fan Edition” of its flagship phone, it just made that flagship the lower-cost version. That’s a reasonable choice for Samsung to make, but it also means that you as a consumer have one less choice. Once again, if you want Samsung’s very best phone this year, you’re going to have to buy Samsung’s biggest phone — and this year, the differences are even more stark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iFdWeP"&gt;But if you’re not interested in the latest, greatest, and biggest, and you don’t mind the way Samsung handles Android, the Galaxy S21 is a fine choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review: the real deal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;More phone, less money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5nU2FD"&gt;Samsung’s “Ultra” phones are meant to be the absolute pinnacle of the company’s (non-folding) mobile technology. And so the Galaxy S21 Ultra — the third Ultra phone after the S20 and Note 20 Ultras — spares very few expenses. The price is lower than before, starting at $1,199.99, but the phone itself is a perfect example of what happens when Samsung goes all-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7yZKC"&gt;It’s also a perfect example of how Samsung often whiffs on its first attempt at something but presses on anyway, eventually achieving the original vision it couldn’t the first time. The original Galaxy S20 Ultra from last year promised much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"&gt;more than its parts could achieve&lt;/a&gt;. The Note 20 Ultra fixed the worst bugs but didn’t improve image quality. Thus far, the “ultra” line hasn’t been especially ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcKQIL"&gt;This year, I’m hard pressed to find major faults with the Galaxy S21’s hardware. (Software, unfortunately, is another story.) The S21 Ultra is a huge phone and an expensive one, so it won’t appeal to many — but if you’re okay with those qualities, then it is also the best Android phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTFr8V"&gt;I guess third time’s the charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mxblBx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10294570"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeqTG9TtdMdfvxPoil_iBKPmKfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248903/vpavic_210119_4377_0153.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has Gorilla Victus glass on the back&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PjLD7I"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KioJJN"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is another in a long line of truly massive Samsung phones. The screen measures 6.8 inches diagonally, which is basically tablet territory. If you are keeping score — and you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that Samsung is — the S21 Ultra’s screen spec is 0.1 inches bigger than the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. (If you account for the curved corners on the screen, the viewing area on both phones is technically smaller.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra vs. the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The Galaxy is narrower and easier to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ub7Vke"&gt;Big Android phones are common now, though, so Samsung’s job is to not only make a powerful phone but to make one that feels well-made. Mission accomplished: the S21 Ultra looks great and feels better. It’s much more comfortable to hold than the iPhone 12 Pro Max because it is a little narrow and because it has curved edges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4P3DSB"&gt;Samsung’s main design change was to blend the metal rails on the sides into the camera array on the back. It looks as good as last year’s mesa-like camera bump looked bad. I’d become a little blind to just how weird and bad most camera bumps look, and the Ultra is a reminder that they can be better designed. Though, of course, there are five big holes (four cameras, one for the laser-focusing system) which are kind of a lot to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vf1R7"&gt;There’s no getting around that this is a massive, relatively heavy phone. But Samsung also has a ton of experience making gigantic phones, and it has applied everything it has learned here. For example, contrary to the current trend, the screen is still just a little curved on the sides. I think it was the right call — it narrows the bezels on the left and right just that much more, making the phone easier to hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWC08e"&gt;As you may have heard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230934/samsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color"&gt;Samsung is proud&lt;/a&gt; of its new, matted “phantom black” finish on the Gorilla Victus Glass on the back of the phone. It is indeed very black and it repels fingerprints well. However, I am a little worried about its durability. We have already put a tiny scratch on ours that shows through as silver simply by setting the phone down on concrete to take a photo of it. Something to watch out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WyL0Dn"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra specs and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PwU1iw"&gt;Funny story: usually when Samsung introduces a new flagship phone, its reps will talk my ear off about the technology and quality of its new, big screen. This year, the company simply pointed out that it supports an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz at its native 3200 x 1440 resolution and left it at that. If there had been a mic to hold on the video conference call, it could have been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gkodi8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10294644"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="voXCV1"&gt;Left unsaid because Samsung rightly knew it could be assumed: this is the best screen on a smartphone. Samsung’s default color balance choice is a little intense, but there’s a Natural option and even the ability to custom tune the Vivid option to your liking. It can reach up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness in HDR video, as well. Samsung’s “Eye Comfort” setting for turning down blue light at night is still a little ham-fisted compared to the iPhone, but that’s my only real complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxYFFS"&gt;Internally, the S21 line is the first set of mass market phones with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor. Samsung says it is utilizing the extra features in this chip to improve image processing and add the variable refresh rate (which runs from 10Hz up to 120Hz) at full resolution. It also supports Wi-Fi 6E and both flavors of 5G. The chip doesn’t benchmark as well as the iPhone’s A14 Bionic, but in single core marks it beats other Android phones with the older 865 chip handily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEnRZB"&gt;More important to me is that it feels fast. I never perceived any major lag anywhere in the phone. It also might be providing some battery efficiency improvements. For my testing, I turned on every bell and whistle: max resolution, adaptive refresh rate, high brightness, always-on screen. Even when shooting a ton of photos, 4K and 8K video, and playing games, the 5,000mAh battery lasted through the next morning consistently. With less intense usage this is easily a two-day phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX1JV"&gt;If you’re looking at this phone, you will want to step up from the default 128GB of storage. The 256GB option only costs $50 more, while 512GB (which also has 16GB of RAM instead of 12) costs $180 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5QYh7"&gt;Getting more storage on this phone is important because unlike previous S-series phones, there’s no microSD card slot on the S21 Ultra. Perhaps it was inevitable as a cost-cutting measure (along with nixing the AC adapter and MST payment tech that worked with standard credit card readers), but it’s a bummer nonetheless. A phone that encourages you to take 8K video and 108-megapixel photos needs more than 128GB of storage, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Waqhzv"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is also the first S-series phone to get support for Samsung’s S Pen stylus, though it’s sold separately and you’ll need to figure out a way to carry it (Samsung will happily sell you a bundle with a case). Later this year, Samsung will sell an S Pen Pro that adds in Bluetooth so you can use it as a remote for you phone if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaOBGT"&gt;I didn’t get the S Pen to test so I can’t speak to whether it’s any good, but I don’t have any reason to expect it would be too different from the stylus experience on the Note line of phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUxWWM"&gt;But of all the specs I’ve listed — both good and disappointing — the one that had the biggest tangible effect on my experience was the new in-screen fingerprint sensor from Qualcomm. It’s both bigger and faster, and it means I can just quickly tap to unlock the phone without needing to aim that carefully. Because we unlock our phones so often, even tiny changes make a huge difference in reducing a sense of friction. It finally feels on par with rear-mounted fingerprint sensors. And of course, it works when you’re wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoWSDaQkXbibQNYSNs1u0nCpZ5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248894/vpavic_210118_4377_0068.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are five cameras on the S21 Ultra, plus a laser autofocus sensor on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qTt71x"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aUvczA"&gt;It should come as no surprise that Samsung can make a big phone with good specs and a great screen. What is really supposed to make the Galaxy S21 Ultra “ultra” is the camera system — it’s the most important differentiator from the other Galaxy S phones and the place where Samsung wants to rack up the biggest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXrdLm"&gt;However, racking up megapixels and zoom lenses does not guarantee either good photos or a good experience. Look no further than the original Ultra phone, last year’s Galaxy S20 Ultra. It suffered from serious focusing issues and generally didn’t justify its higher price. The Note 20 Ultra added laser autofocus, but it still didn’t do as much as it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eOnsL"&gt;To justify its price and size, the Galaxy S21 Ultra needed to overcome years of stasis and finally bring Samsung up to par with the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGCJVH"&gt;It has. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate, but sometimes a little brighter than the scene" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRLQcWk_QOs2kA5dXrdDNe9AJY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248967/05_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210115_20210115_161844.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 Ultra’s color is usually accurate but sometimes a little brighter than the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACRGWL"&gt;The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best I’ve used on any Android phone and is extremely competitive with the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And with telephoto shots, it usually wins outright. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyLohX"&gt;I came into this review with a lot of skepticism. Anytime a company promises camera improvements — especially when they are promised on the back of more megapixels and more cameras — skepticism is the right attitude. On both of those fronts, Samsung is not shying away from promises. There are five image sensors, none of them throwaways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="m4U46A"&gt;Main wide angle: 108-megapixel, OIS, f/1.8, 0.8μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6LTiHt"&gt;Ultrawide: 12-megapixel, 120-degree field of view, f/2.2, 1.4μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E20Cfr"&gt;Telephoto 1: 10-megapixel, Optical 3X, OIS, f/2.4, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dKvA2i"&gt;Telephoto 2: 10-megapixel, Optical 10X, OIS, f/4.9, 1.22μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mFSNmO"&gt;Selfie camera: 40-megapixel,  80-degree field of view, f/2.2, 0.7 μm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="k8JYGg"&gt;The fifth hole on the back of the phone is for the laser autofocus sensor, which was added to help with some of the focus issues on the main sensor. That main 108-megapixel sensor is also a second-generation sensor, capable of 12-bit color and featuring what Samsung says is a new “remosaicing” process for converting 108-megapixels into the default 12-megapixel images. (Getting 12-bit color requires diving into the settings and using Pro mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-i2k1W8B-bukc8aH95jdokoLNfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248987/20210116_20210116_144203.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco skyline, shot on S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1nvMyM"&gt;I am happy to report that nearly every problem I had with the original Galaxy S20 Ultra’s camera system has been resolved. Focusing is fast and accurate, the focal plane seems bigger, there’s no discernible shutter lag, and most of all: the pictures look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRuNy3"&gt;The main sensor also simply feels more predictable. It focuses where I tap, and parts I’d expect to get some bokeh have a nice blur. In the dark, it switches over to night mode and produces images that have significantly less noise than before (though a touch more noise than the iPhone 12 Pro Max). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qdfmu0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDc9ce"&gt;Samsung continues to tune photos differently than I prefer. Compared to the iPhone, it aims to make things a little brighter and the colors a little more intense, while Apple seems to more confidently let shadows be shadows. However, the S21 Ultra often provides better sharpness and detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RokZzh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10294723"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BALGwk"&gt;Where the S21 Ultra really shines is on zooming. It has two telephoto lenses and I found myself believing in the utility of having both. Proper optical zoom at 3X makes a big difference, and Samsung uses data from multiple lenses up to 10X. Samsung still has its gimmicky “Space Zoom” that works up to 100X, but I couldn’t get anything usable beyond 30X and even then it required a lot of light to create something passable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gklCV5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s2rJyX"&gt;As for video, we are equally impressed. The S21 Ultra does a very good job with dynamic range and adjusting exposure on the fly as you pan the camera through a scene. Stabilization is improved, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccDt9N"&gt;Some of you might be surprised that I haven’t mentioned the Pixel 5 yet. Well, it has fallen behind. Both the S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max have switched to physically larger sensors and it has revealed the limits of computational photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cSoRMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10294732"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WufM3c"&gt;As for the head-to-head with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, here’s where I have landed. If you were to take 50 photos or videos, 30 of them would be a toss-up based on your personal preference, seven or eight would be clearly better on the S21, and 12 or 13 would be better from the iPhone. They’re very close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcGQ70"&gt;But Samsung has those telephoto options. And it also has compensated for the relative dearth of high-quality third-party Android photo apps by building in its own features. Samsung has added a “director’s mode” that lets you switch lenses on the fly while shooting video in 1080p, but I found that I preferred shooting in 4K. You can shoot in 8K and pull out a still photo, you can use “Single Take 2” to let the AI try to make a bunch of amusing photos and video effects. Samsung’s Pro modes for both photo and video are excellent. You can shoot in RAW, too, although it is a standard RAW, not an Apple-style ProRAW that has some of the benefits of HDR mixed in. (I’ll leave a full Samsung RAW vs. iPhone ProRAW competition for others.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Even in Portrait Mode, face smoothing can finally be fully disabled." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjxf2Pc6F-HxO9kAmY_1u7Xe9kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249027/31_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_20210118_20210118_113001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uYFCT9"&gt;Overall, there are just a thousand different ways you can work with this camera, and it can be a little overwhelming. But the good news is that the experience of just snapping a photo will yield better results than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWajv1"&gt;I’ve saved my favorite news for last: Samsung has finally, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; given us the option to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; turn off face smoothing. Behold, my wrinkles and blemishes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;No more Hamcam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eK90LX"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Aw49cl"&gt;Here’s how Samsung’s versions of Android work: they get way way too messy and complicated, everybody complains, and eventually Samsung simplifies things. Then the cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLX0xk"&gt;Right now, we’re still heading toward the land of complication. Samsung’s One UI interface is still good for big screens, but there are just so many options in quick settings, many of which mean nothing to the average person. Unforgivably, there are still ads built into Samsung’s default apps. The biggest thing on the default home screen is a weather widget. Tap it and the next biggest thing you’re likely to see is the kind of ad that’s normally at the bottom of a crappy, overloaded website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7eHWoK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the Galaxy S21 Ultra has a downfall, it’s in how Samsung’s version of Android has become messy and displays ads in some apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CvhqQQ"&gt;Bixby, Samsung’s digital assistant, is still the default, and it’s difficult to switch away from it (you need third-party software). Surprisingly, it’s somewhat better than the last time I used it, but it’s still brittle. When I asked it to set a second alarm for 15 minutes, it consistently canceled my first alarm and set one for one second. If you set it up and set SmartThings up for your smart home and live an entirely Samsung-based life, Bixby is passable. But it’s also not necessary. The Google Assistant is still here and still better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jE6yOU"&gt;Then there’s texting. In the US, Samsung ships these phones with Samsung Messages by default, whereas everybody else in the world gets Android Messages and therefore RCS. Some US carriers support RCS on Samsung Messages, but badly. AT&amp;amp;T’s version of RCS doesn’t interoperate with other carriers yet, for example. I know Samsung isn’t to blame for RCS’s problems, but as the biggest Android seller in the US, you’d like to think the company would try to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3OPDt"&gt;But if you know your way around Android, you can make the S21 Ultra a really amazing and powerful phone. Dodge or disable all those ads and install all the non-Samsung versions of software, and it’s a powerful and sometimes elegant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8fd0L"&gt;Samsung is also better at letting customers customize its software for gigantic phone screens than Apple is. You can split-screen apps, convert apps to little pop-up floating windows, turn on a slide-over bar with access to your clipboard and calendar, and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYtUfN"&gt;Getting to all that power requires wading through a lot of complexity, but I’ve always found it to be worth the effort. I just wish Samsung wouldn’t make it so difficult in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5oxfkCuVQEPp3NmhYJqj8Jl5nLU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248892/vpavic_210118_4377_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="t2V5QP"&gt;Usually, a review of a superpowered phone from Samsung consists of a bunch of promises and then a bunch of reality checks on those promises. With the Galaxy S21 Ultra, there are fewer caveats than before. The battery lasts beyond a full day. There’s a beautiful new design. It has the fastest speeds, best camera system, and nicest screen of any Android phone right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWSJ51"&gt;If you’re wondering how the smaller Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus compare, we’ll have follow-up reviews on those — but as a spoiler, I’ll just tell you both are much more iterative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLSVCS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best Android phone right now, if you don’t mind the size and the price&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfLF1x"&gt;The biggest reality check is the software, which suffers from Samsung’s heavy-handed attempts to build its own ecosystem and further monetize an already expensive phone. I doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra will convince many iPhone users to switch — the ecosystem lock-in on iOS is too strong for that and getting the most out of Samsung’s version of Android is daunting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Wif2B"&gt;If you can navigate the software, the size, and the price tag, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best Android phone available today. I don’t know how long it will be able to hold on to that crown, but it’s got it now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YGWnV0"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is finally worthy of the name.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Nord N10 5G review: tall phone, small price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For $300, it’s right on the money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EO9rwg"&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G does something unique: bring 5G to a $299.99 phone without cutting too many corners. That’s a full $200 lower than other budget-oriented competitors like the Google Pixel 4A 5G and Samsung Galaxy A51 5G. Alongside its lower-tier N100 sibling, it’s the first phone in OnePlus’ midrange Nord series to arrive in the US, available from T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, and unlocked from OnePlus.com and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5m2r0"&gt;It’s definitely noteworthy that the N10 5G will bring 5G to the under-$300 market. But at least for now, 5G isn’t something most people should care about, much less pay more for. Fortunately, the N10 5G has more going for it. It has a big screen with a high refresh rate, a tall aspect ratio that might make it easier for people with smaller hands to use, and OnePlus’ light-touch take on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziaFwm"&gt;So what sacrifices did OnePlus make to create a $300 phone? The quick version is this: it offers an LCD rather than an OLED screen, uses a less robust processor than midrange and flagship phones, and doesn’t include any water resistance. And you won’t find features that are becoming more common on midrange devices, like wireless charging and telephoto cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTe6sc"&gt;The question for the N10 5G is whether you’d be happy with a decent all-around device that doesn’t shine in any particular area, or if you should look to one of its budget competitors that goes all in on a feature like battery life or photo quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="39E53z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10267045"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HhPuLh"&gt;As you’d expect from a $300 phone, the rear of the device is plastic — a glossy, smudge-attracting panel. The phone itself feels appropriately weighty and while it doesn’t scream ‘flagship’ it doesn’t feel too cheap either. I actually kind of like the plastic finish; I feel like it’s a little easier to grip and not as prone to slipping as glass. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back that was quick and reliable in my testing. Overall, it was pretty comfortable to hold and use, despite what its dimensions initially suggested to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81ztms"&gt;Somewhat unusually, the N10 5G offers a very tall 20:9 aspect ratio on its screen. It’s a 6.49-inch, 1080 x 2400 LCD, which makes for a device with a generous screen that doesn’t feel too bulky in your hand. Personally I like a small phone, but this felt like a bigger phone I could actually use. I don’t feel like I’m straining to like an Instagram post when I hold it in one hand. It’s a tight fit in my coat pocket but I could live with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PeP8IP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I like a small phone, but this felt like a bigger phone I could actually use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNm4BX"&gt;This screen offers a 90Hz refresh rate that’s faster than the 60Hz typically seen at this price point. This makes for smooth scrolling through apps and makes the phone that bit nicer to use than you might expect for $300. However, the screen does use LCD technology, which lacks the rich contrast of OLED panels you’ll find in many competitors that cost just a little more. It’s good enough in day-to-day use, and it’s viewable in direct sunlight, but it’s not your best option if you watch a lot of dimly lit period dramas on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QB1jgY"&gt;The N10 uses a Snapdragon 690 5G processor, one of Qualcomm’s budget 6-series chips, which includes support for the phone’s headline feature: 5G. It’s worth noting that the 690 supports low and mid-band 5G frequencies, but doesn’t offer mmWave connectivity (that’s the super-fast but hard to find variety of 5G). This is also a good time to remind you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;not to buy a new phone just for 5G&lt;/a&gt;. But if you must, be sure to check your carrier’s coverage map before you opt for this or any other 5G phone, and temper your expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3QtPB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus has said it will update the N10 5G to Android 11, but that’s it for major updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IZLjjy"&gt;The N10 5G ships with Android 10, which is one version behind the very latest update. OnePlus has said &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-n100-single-update-android-11"&gt;it will give the N10 and N100 an update&lt;/a&gt; to Android 11, but that’s it for major updates — users will have to settle for two years of security updates. That’s not uncommon at this price point, but it’s an important point to consider. If you plan to pay for it in installments and upgrade within a couple of years anyway, that’s no great loss. If you’d rather get a few solid years out of your device, then the N10 won’t be your best option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHx7Kb"&gt;OnePlus’ Oxygen OS brings a fairly clean implementation of Android to the N10 5G. You can customize the font and theme, and choose between full gesture control or a navigation bar with fixed controls for home, back and recents. It’s not the pure experience of a Pixel phone, but it doesn’t feel overly cluttered for my taste. I don’t love the OnePlus-themed clock widget on the home screen by default, but it’s mercifully removable, as are the handful of OnePlus-specific apps like Community that I’m not sure I would use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gOsD68"&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3Tdrt7"&gt;You can’t build a $300 phone without making some compromises, and a cheaper processor is one way to do that. The Snapdragon 690 at the heart of the N10 is a newer chip for budget devices, and in my use it turned in decent performance. Occasionally I noticed it stuttering when I scrolled quickly past some very image and video-rich screens, and the camera app sometimes took a few seconds to open. In the camera app itself I saw some slowdowns in the image preview when panning quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6mI1E"&gt;But for the most part I streamed videos, used Google Maps, played games, ordered coffee, and scrolled through Instagram without issue. Speed is definitely one area where OnePlus had to make some concessions, and though performance lagged noticeably at times, I wouldn’t call it a deal-breaker for most people who would consider the N10 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfY-9ttE8I0k8ON-H9HxuxO1r0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214160/ajohnson200104_4354_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The headphone jack lives!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ByqJne"&gt;The N10 5G is configured with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with a MicroSDXC slot for even more space. All three of those specs are more generous than many comparable devices at this price point, and for some may offset the relative pain of the slow processor. Dual speakers provide stereo sound for videos, but audio quality isn’t great. Wired headphones are an option, though, since the N10 5G includes a real, live headphone jack. (OnePlus aficionados should be aware that there’s no ringer switch here, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUCR3A"&gt;The N10 5G isn’t all about battery the way the battery-for-days N100 and Moto G Power are, but its 4,300mAh battery delivers a solid day’s worth of use — and often more than that. I usually got about a day and a half of moderate use out of a full charge. OnePlus includes a 30W fast charger in the box, which is also uncommon at this price point, and it is truly fast: it took the device from 7% to 50% in 20 minutes in my experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvKZ3-57f7JmZbGR2-SzAORFbS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214161/ajohnson200104_4354_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The N10 5G’s quad camera array&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ksbep7"&gt;Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="e4FOwl"&gt;You’ll find four cameras (plus a flash) on the N10 5G’s rear camera bump. Here’s a quick rundown of the phone’s cameras:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s2CZqb"&gt;A 64-megapixel main camera with a f/1.79 lens and no optical stabilization (electronic only) that produces 16-megapixel images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JiQ1C5"&gt;An 8-megapixel ultrawide with a f/2.25 lens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="53DsHf"&gt;A 2-megapixel f/2.4 macro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CfUZDR"&gt;A 2-megapixel f/2.4 monochrome camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xpRtl1"&gt;A front-facing 16-megapixel f/2.05 selfie camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5YxLvi"&gt;This seems like a lot of cameras, especially since two of them are unlikely to be used frequently. The monochrome camera only kicks in when shooting in black and white, which is accessed by scrolling through the filter options to the very last one. Likewise, the macro camera is activated via the main shooting screen by tapping the flower icon. It’s sort of fun to mess around with, but even in decent lighting image quality is pretty bad. Images from the ultrawide camera are a bit soft if you look closely, but it’s not noticeable enough to ruin an Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1la41a"&gt;The good news is that the main camera is just fine in decent lighting — good, even, considering this is a $300 phone. Colors are on the punchy side without straying into oversaturation, and detail is mostly acceptable in even moderately low light conditions like a well-lit interior. Things get a little noisy and smudgy in low light, but the 64-megapixel sensor (which kicks out 16-megapixel images) does a nice job of hanging on to at least some detail. Nightscape mode does bring back an impressive amount of light in darker situations, but you can’t get away with shooting in near darkness like you can with the Pixel’s Night Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n1xacH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10267032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LsTARh"&gt;I did find that it struggled to find focus at times, and it’s definitely not up to the task of capturing moving subjects in low light, like pets and children. It also lacks a true telephoto camera, and will instead use digital zoom if you switch to the tele setting on the main shooting screen. Resulting images are very soft and have an unpleasant, overprocessed digital look about them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnfF8f"&gt;Overall, it’s a camera that doesn’t try to do too much, which is a good thing. If you mostly photograph static scenes and don’t push it too hard, you can expect images that will look just fine on social media. But if you’re looking for any kind of modest zoom or top-notch performance in low light, you’d best look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The included fast charger for the N10" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8J9DgFd6y1oMe3nqpSh_CfUwOQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214159/ajohnson200104_4354_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The included fast charger for the N10&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LuXxtR"&gt;Bottom line: this is a very cheap 5G phone with a big screen and decent all-around performance. OnePlus has made some smart sacrifices to get to that $300 price point, and the result is a device with many nice attributes but without a major standout feature. If there’s a particular feature that you prioritize on your phone, like multi-day battery life or an above-average camera, then you can do better around the same price or a little more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f5zlPJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you want a very inexpensive 5G phone that doesn’t have any deal-breaking flaws, the N10 5G is it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l7rOhH"&gt;If you can live without 5G for now (and we think you probably can!) you can get a phone with a little something extra for around the same price. For big battery life you could look to the N100 or Moto G Power. For an above average camera, look at the Google Pixel 4a. That phone is also a good candidate if device longevity or better performance are important to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="u9eprq"&gt;If you want a very inexpensive 5G phone that doesn’t have any deal-breaking flaws, the N10 5G is it. Even if you’re not interested in 5G, which most people probably aren’t, this $300 device still delivers in important ways: a good screen, acceptable performance, a good enough camera, and decent battery life. Not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="833z64"&gt;There are a lot of great smartphone options available at any given moment, so it can be a challenge to sort through them all if you’re trying to choose the absolute best one. The stakes here can’t be understated: your phone is the most important gadget in your life, and you’ll probably be living with the one you buy for at least a year, if not two or three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQGOEA"&gt;Most of the time, the best phone stands out from the pack in all the areas that matter: performance, value, camera, and support. And most of the time, that’s usually the most expensive phone on the market. But as it turns out, you don’t have to buy the priciest phone to get the best experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0USm3"&gt;This guide focuses on the best phones on the market, regardless of price. If you’re looking for something on a smaller budget, please &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bEJfKg"&gt;There are many new iPhones to choose from this year, each with different characteristics and prices. The one that most people should buy is the iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5fl1U"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro, but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five different colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2sVfnG"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good — you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XJXAT"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something most people won’t miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR video for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1vQlwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9527699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eK0QNl"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Y0X1g"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJZ9AM"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hHkViI"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zwDSsW"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21172039/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review-camera-5g-screen-android"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 / S20 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qLPa8Y"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4xfZgU"&gt;If you’re looking for an Android phone, the one that we recommend for most people is Samsung’s Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus. Even though these models came out way back in March 2020, they still balance performance, features, design, and build quality better than anything else you can get right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPUenF"&gt;The S20 devices have excellent performance and great battery life. They have 120Hz displays that make every interaction as smooth as it can be. They also support 5G networks, just like any other flagship phone this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S71nF"&gt;Both models have standard, ultrawide, and telephoto cameras on the rear, which provide a lot of flexibility when you’re composing photos. They may not be quite as good as the cameras you can get on an iPhone 12 or 12 Pro Max, but they are still very good and most people will find they take excellent photos and video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JEKgzH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The S20 and S20 Plus have the right mix of performance, design, and features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t0nxLN"&gt;Samsung actually has another model in the S20 line that’s larger and more expensive than the S20 or S20 Plus: the S20 Ultra. We don’t recommend it: its camera system looks more advanced on a spec sheet but is less reliable and not as enjoyable to use and we don’t think it’s worth the extra $400 you’ll pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR9r50"&gt;Choosing between the S20 and S20 Plus comes down to basically one thing: do you want an oversized screen or not? The S20 has a large 6.2-inch screen; the S20 Plus has an enormous 6.7-inch screen. The latter will definitely be harder to use in one hand and might not slip into your pocket as easily, but the screen is gorgeous to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pt5XrR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560504"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGXnzc"&gt;Perhaps the best part of the S20 models is that you can get them for a good price, now that they’ve been on the market for more than six months. At launch, the S20 was about $1,000, while the S20 Plus was $1,200, both for 128GB models. But now you can regularly find the S20 in the $700 to $800 range, with the S20 Plus typically $200 more. At those prices, you can’t find a better Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9WVvG1"&gt;Rumors are pointing to Samsung releasing a new S21 model line as soon as January 2021. That can mean two things: if you are only looking for the latest and greatest, you might want to wait. But it could also mean we’ll see even more significant discounts on the S20 line than we already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gzg6sU"&gt;Best midrange Android phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BHvw0G"&gt;The midrange phone market (models priced between $500 and $700) has exploded this year, but the one that stands out from the pack is Samsung’s Galaxy S20 FE. The reason is because it barely feels like a midrange phone; with just a couple of tweaks, this could easily pass for a premium flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0zWPa"&gt;Like the other S20 models, the FE has a 120Hz display that makes every touch, scroll, or interaction feel smooth. It also has a top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor — you’re not giving up anything in terms of performance here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utHVpW"&gt;Its camera system has the familiar wide, ultrawide, and telephoto setup, with all three cameras having 12-megapixel sensors. In good light, they all take reliably good phones; where you’ll notice a difference between this and more expensive phones is when it starts to get dark. But Samsung’s night mode does work surprisingly well and helps out quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pRofCu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHfnRH"&gt;The biggest thing that separates the S20 FE from the other S20 models is its materials: instead of a glass back, it has a cheaper plastic one. It still feels well-made and sturdy, though, and once you put a case on it you won’t even notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkgjI7"&gt;At its regular price of $700, the S20 FE is an excellent performing phone with a good value. But like most Samsung phones, you often can get it with a significant discount, making it an even more impressive value. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a9366L"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YEmUyn"&gt;Best small phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XOIazq"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs — you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW9lbN"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s still small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to reach all of it with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8rvOC"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fEqbqa"&gt;Best battery life you can get&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0OxORr"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJK8J3"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. The Note 20 Ultra is a productivity powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBHFzE"&gt;There are other phones on the market with equally as big or even bigger batteries than the Note 20 Ultra, but they aren’t as premium or feature rich and they require you to make noticeable compromises elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cqDZyL"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UnCwn5"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HMWyVS"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8SOLCW"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Lzlez"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iPhone SE provides the most bang for your buck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIIlAI"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sJumlJ"&gt;Best budget phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jUoPHA"&gt;The budget phone (under $500) that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Specifically, we recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNXHmP"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried-and-true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqRVDv"&gt;But in exchange for that very familiar phone body, you get a lot of value. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its processor, Apple’s A13 Bionic. That matters not just because of speed, but because it also means the phone will have a much longer lifetime in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n2bsbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPHfUO"&gt;Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means that in a few years the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhPqRw"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2020 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ODEAze"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zGSyayDrR2mXPWMiM9i0d_4YCk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691996/vpavic_200728_4113_0127.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s PIxel 4A is the best Android phone under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means that the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books, to browsing the web, to watching video, to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than you’re used to. It is also delicate — there’s no rated dust or water resistance and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: at $2,000, the Fold 2 is literally twice as expensive as other high-end phones. You’re paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="B1aeyk"&gt;Buying a smartphone for under $500 is a lesson in setting priorities. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point, but luckily you will be able to buy a great phone that does the things that matter the most to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qMTFV"&gt;Phones at this price point are better than ever, many coming with features that used to be reserved just for flagships. But instead of getting it all, you should think about the features that you care about and focus on finding a phone that nails them. Some phones emphasize a big screen, others a quality camera, and one of them emphasizes speed and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opZnVh"&gt;The trend of inexpensive phones getting better has been happening for a few years now, with companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung making devices that absolutely can meet your needs for less. Other companies like TCL have started trying to build their own brand by marketing directly, and OnePlus is also making a return to the lower end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O271rc"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the Apple iPhone SE. It serves the needs of most people and does a competent job at everything, but its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77wmze"&gt;If you prefer an Android phone or are looking to spend less, then the options start to bifurcate a little bit. The Google Pixel 4A has an excellent camera and good software, but it doesn’t have the large screen many people are looking for. To get that, your best bet is Samsung’s Galaxy A51 smartphone, which does boast a big, beautiful screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAV1gP"&gt;Those phones are pretty much available worldwide, but if you’re in the markets where OnePlus has more presence, the OnePlus Nord is a newcomer that beats out the competition by hitting a higher baseline in all its categories rather than excelling at just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejzg03"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a flagship: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight As in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xGSQd4"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Specifically, we recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yS33o"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJSrTq"&gt;But in exchange for that very familiar phone body, you get a lot of value. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its processor, Apple’s A13 Bionic. That matters because it is literally the fastest processor you can get on any phone, anywhere. It’s the exact same chip found in Apple’s $999-and-up iPhone 11 Pro. Normally speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means that in a few years the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPInwx"&gt;Battery life is good, but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, a relative rarity at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape of the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8 there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbhSVu"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2020 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEIcsk"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four, five, or even six years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s clean iOS software, and huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ea8Tfu"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxMxyh"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means that the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMP3dB"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgAIi6"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EQNFx"&gt;Unfortunately, in three years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbtrpB"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uLYmxs"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US right now. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jllZvZ"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high-refresh-rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMIHtL"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is solid, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzsRwZ"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQiNib"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t support the right LTE bands.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A51 has a huge screen and is otherwise a pretty decent phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHeLLf"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A51&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n49IDp"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9zHmts"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCBvU5"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BPSfp"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReiNOy"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ot0H0"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you’d like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant OneUI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZjXl5"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;If you really think you need 5G&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WqKDDc"&gt;If you live in the US, chances are the 5G networks in your area are not going to live up to the high-flying promises carriers have been making. But if you really do think you’d benefit from 5G, the best phone under $500 that supports it is Google’s Pixel 4A 5G. At $499, it comes in just under the wire on our price limit — but the Verizon version costs an extra $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbBb7l"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great still camera, solid battery life, and clean Google software. It has some other benefits, though. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W2PnU"&gt;It also has a larger screen, clocking in at 6.2 inches diagonally. It doesn’t feel too gigantic when you hold it, but you can tell it’s a larger phone. Google chose this size not to give you that bigger screen, but because it needed the extra space to hold all the components and antennas required for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m13wf6"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajp1K5"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little Google touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K241jf"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but right now those networks still need to be built out a little bit more. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pxVQdv"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pn815f"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uP3407"&gt;Motorola makes a pair of phones that are siblings: the G Stylus and the G Power. The difference between them is right there in the names: the G Stylus comes with a stylus and the G Power has a larger battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3BFGL"&gt;We prefer the G Power because a 5,000mAh battery on a $249 phone is a shockingly good deal. You will, of course, notice a bunch of other compromises in exchange for that huge battery, but if you definitely need a phone that will last, the G Power is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pvfy9"&gt;The G Power has a 6.4-inch FHD+ display which looks decent, but it unfortunately only has 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. You’ll get by on both, but you’ll run into hassles just a bit more quickly than on phones with more. The processor is a Snapdragon 665, which will be enough to run whatever app you want, it just won’t launch it quickly and overall the phone may feel too slow in two or three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDBZ93"&gt;As for cameras, the G Power keeps the trend of a main sensor, an ultrawide, and a macro on the back. The main sensor is 16 megapixels and performs much better than the $250 price would lead you to expect. If you’ve used inexpensive Motorola phones before, you’ll likely find that the G Power offers a big step up in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHrfLr"&gt;If you’re very confident you want a stylus, your best bet is to see if you can find a refurbished or gently used Samsung Galaxy Note. It does a much better job providing a software ecosystem of compatible apps for its stylus. If you can’t, the G Stylus pretty much matches what we’ve said about the G Power, just with less battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aQnAQL"&gt;The phone that looks professional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="woKhbI"&gt;TCL is probably best known for its televisions, but it has served as the white label manufacturer for smartphones for many years. Now, it’s trying to make a name for itself in smartphones with new, low-cost options like the TCL 10L and the TCL 10 Pro. The Pro is the upgrade pick and retails for $449.90, though you can often find it on sale for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnR7sq"&gt;The 10 Pro looks like it means business. Instead of iridescent colors and big camera bumps, it’s thin, flat, and gray. It has a 6.47-inch display, but overall feels smaller than some phones on this list. You also get a headphone jack and a big, 4,500mAh battery that should get you through a full day without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikA6Gl"&gt;The best spec on the 10 Po is its 6GB of RAM, which is plenty for multitasking and should keep your most recent apps from shutting down in the background. There’s the appropriate 128GB of storage, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uQsKq"&gt;The 10 Pro’s understated looks also extend to the Android software, which has a few extra little features but generally tends to stay out of your way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6q4BYj"&gt;As for cameras, they’re somewhat uninspiring: there’s a 64-megapixel main sensor, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro. The photos you’ll get have that over-processed look that sometimes makes images look artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OWbWI"&gt;Overall, the best thing about the TCL 10 Pro is that it has plenty of RAM for multitasking and a thin shape that isn’t bombastic. If you can find a good deal on one, it’s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SqJJAi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 12 mini review: fit to size</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not the best iPhone for most people, but it’s going to be a favorite for many&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WcAaL9"&gt;If you asked me which of the four different models of the new iPhone 12 you should buy without providing any further context on your needs or desires, I would tell you to buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;regular iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; without question. It has the best balance of screen size, storage, cameras, battery life, and value. It is, in my opinion, the best iPhone 12 for most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9n4e0"&gt;But the iPhone 12 mini is my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYK1Ka"&gt;For the first time in many years, Apple is making an intentionally small phone. The key, though, is that unlike other small phones, Apple isn’t putting worse parts in it. The iPhone 12 mini has all the same features as the larger iPhone 12. It has the same cameras, same processor, same everything save for two things: screen size and battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIhcXD"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini starts at $729 for a 64GB model in the US, but $50 more gets the 128GB model and that’s a much better option. It’s a small phone, but it’s not a cheap phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gykqHc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21319942"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="43W7tD"&gt;iPhone 12 mini hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ezSvny"&gt;It’s traditional to refer to phones by their screen size and for the iPhone 12 mini, that number is 5.4 inches diagonally. But that number doesn’t tell the story at all. The phone is smaller than the traditional 4.7-inch-home-button iPhone design we saw from the iPhone 6 on through the 6S, 7, 8, and 2020 SE models, even though the screen itself is larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdEc46"&gt;That’s because the 12 mini, just like the rest of the iPhone 12 line, has switched over to Apple’s more modern OLED screens and Face ID notch for unlocking. Those two features allow Apple to design the phone with minimal bezels and maximal screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skoj7q"&gt;Despite the smaller screen size, you don’t miss out on as much as you might expect. Compared to the regular iPhone 12 with a 6.1-inch screen, there are maybe one or two lines of text that are cut off. What you actually miss out on is that sense of immersion you can get from a bigger screen when you’re playing a game or watching a movie. Those were the only times this screen felt cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVgW3X"&gt;If there is a knock on the screen, it’s that it doesn’t offer a high refresh rate like many Android phones — including the Pixel 5, which isn’t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far off from the iPhone 12 mini’s size. I’m more annoyed that the Pro iPhones don’t have it, though — here on the mini, I think battery life is more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 12 mini (top) and the regular iPhone 12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwy2JC"&gt;To me, the iPhone 12 mini is most reminiscent of the iPhone 5. Yes, it is bigger and has a glass rear panel instead of aluminum, but it shares the squared-off aluminum sides and general feeling of being an object that was designed to be proportional to your hand. This is a phone that you can get a grip on, literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4HKzs"&gt;The phone feels well built, with tight tolerances and subtle touches like carefully beveled edges. The rear glass is glossy and the rails are matte — on our black review unit the rails have a kind of slate finish instead of being true black. The camera bump on the back and the Face ID notch on the front are proportionally big compared to the smaller size of the phone, but not annoyingly so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3gVG7"&gt;Because it’s a bit narrower, it’s easier to reach the opposite side of the screen with your thumb. Because it’s a bit shorter, a lot of people will be able to reach the top for the swipe-down gestures without contorting their hands into awkward claws or risking dropping the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJnBWp"&gt;It has a much, much better chance of fitting into small pockets — the kind that are all too common on pants designed for women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTnMPk"&gt;As a man with big pockets and big hands, I do not have the strongest feelings about why it’s been so frustrating not to have a small iPhone option. But I sympathize with those who do and agree with the sentiment 100 percent — I’m glad Apple recognized it and I hope other phone companies do what they often do and follow Apple’s lead.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 12 mini (left) and iPhone 12 (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IF4Fhd"&gt;iPhone 12 mini battery and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="oytonH"&gt;Apple chose to make the iPhone 12 mini hew closely to the features and specs of the regular iPhone 12. It’s a laudable goal, but as I used it I found myself second-guessing that decision a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1M24VJ"&gt;It’s corny to say I’m impressed by how much Apple packed into such a small space — but I am. The iPhone 12 mini has the fastest processor on any phone, it has the same dual-camera system as the iPhone 12, and most remarkably it has all the components and antennas necessary for both sub-6 and (in the US) mmWave 5G. It is fast, multitasks well, and doesn’t feel like a compromise when you use it. It really is an amazing feat of technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLCTCf"&gt;It’s amazing until the battery dies, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="j4vFG8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life is a noticeable step down; you’ll need to pay attention to it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 (left) and the iPhone 12 mini (right).

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzJ8T4vTcwufYzJDT6F-WEzdfLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023425/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmD5mH"&gt;I don’t want to sugarcoat it nor be overly dire about it, but the battery life on the iPhone 12 mini is noticeably worse than on the iPhone 12, which itself was a step down from the battery-champ iPhone 11. For me, it’s good enough, but it does mean I’m already using it differently than I use bigger phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZE83A"&gt;Without making any effort at it, I have consistently drained the iPhone 12 mini’s battery by early evening. I’d say it’s fair to expect the 12 mini to clock up something near four hours of screentime with stuff like web browsing, Facebook, and taking photos. Intense games give you a chance to watch the battery percent tick down minute by minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLbEgW"&gt;So it’s not &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s definitely not great. My feeling after a little less than a week is that getting through a day requires a little bit of battery management. Holding yourself back from putting an hour into an Apple Arcade game, knowing where your next opportunity to charge might be, and above all being more willing to turn on the low power mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO3WQz"&gt;Of course it works with Apple’s new magnet-based MagSafe system for cases and wireless charging. Using MagSafe, the iPhone 12 mini maxes out at 12W wireless charging instead of the 15W you get on the larger iPhones, but since the battery is smaller, the overall charge time ends up being about the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpeMJ2"&gt;Exactly how small is small? Apple never provides exact battery size specs — and I get the reasoning even though I disagree with it. Lots of factors affect battery life, and the iPhone 12 mini has the benefit of a smaller OLED screen. But it also has 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEIynG"&gt;The reality of 5G in the US continues to be very different from the hype. It’s radically dependent on which network you’re on and what part of the country or city you’re in. Often the speeds are equivalent to LTE. If you stand out on the right street corner and get mmWave, you can indeed get speeds that are astonishing — until you walk down the street and they drop back to the same LTE we’ve used for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmXO6K"&gt;I often have to remind people that phone design isn’t inevitable. Apple chose to keep this iPhone 12 mini the same thickness as the iPhone 12 and it chose to keep the extra parts necessary for mmWave 5G. I would rather lose both of those things in exchange for a bigger battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7SwCsS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163820/best-gadgets-2020-tech-samsung-apple-ps5-iphone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RECsS4OxTS94oW5e6NbJSEYwpGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023094/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hXag4T"&gt;iPhone 12 mini cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7Pk60E"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini has the exact same camera setup as the regular iPhone 12. There’s the 12-megapixel main wide-angle camera with a f/1.6 aperture for letting in more light paired with a somewhat worse 12-megapixel ultrawide camera. Unlike the Pro models, there’s no telephoto lens nor a LIDAR sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUq6uV"&gt;I am happy to report that the results are just like the specs: the same. The iPhone 12 mini reverts to Night mode less often than even the iPhone 11 Pro and the Pixel 5. Apple has made some improvements in image processing this year with its A14 Bionic processor that results in more detail in more lighting conditions (aka the Deep Fusion “Sweater Mode”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G8rqE5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9567090"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrC3Eu"&gt;It’s a very good camera system, and that’s not usually something I get to say when I’m talking about a smaller phone. Usually smaller means cut corners and the camera is often the place where those corners get cut. Not so here: video is excellent at handling different lighting conditions, portrait mode is usually more than good enough for Instagram, and you can trust the camera to take the photos you expect when you tap the shutter. And you can expect them to get saved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKylTg"&gt;Next year, though, I hope Apple pays a little more attention to the secondary camera sensors. The selfie camera is fine, but it’s increasingly disappointing compared to the advances on the main camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QClTF7"&gt;I can take some dramatic shots with the ultrawide — the tree you see above is objectively boring but looks dope with this lens. Still, if you zoom in even a little, you can see that on a technical level the ultrawide is also far behind the main sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6toh3O1DbuZe2BqBtVjxfYcviuQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023090/vpavic_4279_20201107_0081.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ow8iP0"&gt;As I said above, I don’t have ergonomic reasons to need a smaller phone. My advice for most people is to get the regular iPhone 12 for its better battery and bigger screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVj89V"&gt;And yet, I love the iPhone 12 mini. It is my favorite of the new iPhone 12 models. Despite real concerns with the battery, it’s the one I have decided to get for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="okzHp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first iPhone in a long time to be designed around ergonomics instead of screen size&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6WevGI"&gt;For me, the reason to prefer the iPhone 12 mini is hard to state in words, but I’ll give it a shot. With every phone, you can tell what it was designed &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt;. There’s some key feature that everything else has to contend with, that sets the hardware narrative. For many years now, that feature was the screen. Making it big, bright, beautiful, and bezel-less was the big thing driving phone design, and all other considerations were secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HoQY0y"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini feels like the first iPhone in a long time with a different goal. It was designed around the human hand and real pockets. It is an object that doesn’t aim to be judged against other smartphones (which are mostly big now), but to be judged simply as an object you need to hold. You judge a spatula or can opener or whatever by whether it’s easy to grip, by whether it fits in your hand. It’s about time we got back to judging smartphones that way, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymQNkg"&gt;That design decision means that other things — like battery life — are secondary. But it’s nevertheless a strange kind of relief to hold it. You know the feeling when a buzzing noise you’d grown accustomed to suddenly stops and you realize you’ve been annoyed all day but couldn’t say why? It’s like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LSftQm"&gt;Whether we admit it or not (and whether we hate it or not), we’ve subtly been adapting ourselves to ever-growing phone sizes. The iPhone 12 mini is adapted to &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s biggest iPhone brings along an impressive camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FxiRSL"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is a big phone. The biggest iPhone ever made, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLWAdK"&gt;The Pro Max’s 6.7-inch display is the largest screen ever on an iPhone. It has the biggest camera sensor of any iPhone, including the three other iPhone 12 models Apple announced this year. It has a 5G radio, and it’s got a bigger battery. It is without question the most iPhone you can get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYHAou"&gt;And while it’s expensive, it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more expensive than the smaller iPhone 12 Pro: it’s just $100 more at every storage level, starting at $1,099 with 128GB of storage and going up to $1,399 for 512GB of storage. For that money, you get a larger display, a bigger battery, and a very different camera system. I’ll just cut to the chase and say it’s absolutely worth it over the standard 12 Pro if you can deal with the size — but it’s a lot of size. And the camera is worth exploring in depth, because there’s a lot going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJYgv9"&gt;Like I said, it’s the most iPhone you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="232UTY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9567008"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTtRTY"&gt;There’s just no getting around it: the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a very big phone. The measurements don’t tell the whole story — by the numbers, it’s just a little bit bigger than the 11 Pro Max, but the new design with flat sides makes it feel much larger than it is, and makes it slightly harder to hold than a phone with curved sides. It’s also a bit heavier than other big phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it feel even bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="deppjt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: ahead of its time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 review: raising the bar","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"},{"title":"Apple iPhone 12 mini review: fit to size","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Y9gCon"&gt;The combination of the size and flat sides basically demands a case to make it easier to hold, which makes the whole thing even bigger. It’s still workable, but it is right on the edge of being too big. I think the size is a reflection of increased choice: this year Apple has more phone sizes available than ever before, including the diminutive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21319336"&gt;iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, so it had the ability to push the Max even farther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aCYSC"&gt;But: it’s still big. I strongly recommend finding a way to &lt;strong&gt;safely&lt;/strong&gt; see the 12 Pro Max’s size in person before making a call on ordering one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The 12 Pro Max has a larger main camera sensor than the other iPhone 12 models.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="92VGL1"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1z7hgk"&gt;Aside from the large size, the main thing that sets the iPhone 12 Pro Max apart from the rest of the iPhone 12 line is the camera system, which is substantially different and more capable than the cameras on the smaller 12 and 12 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8voeoj"&gt;The basics are the same as the 12 Pro: three cameras including a wide, an ultrawide, and a tele, with a LIDAR sensor that enables portrait photos on the wide camera in Night mode. Night mode is available at all three zoom levels now, which is an improvement over the iPhone 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxK0Oq"&gt;The ultrawide camera is the same as on the 12 and 12 Pro, and it’s a noticeable improvement over the ultrawide on the 11 Pro. I think it’s useful and fun to have an ultrawide, but it still takes medium-quality photos compared to the main camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cQfOUPRckCDbMFdNR_uI5T8jBYo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022555/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The telephoto lens on the 12 Pro Max is also slightly different, with a longer field of view.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ue1FUxVTE9deql-HVqDBz3n20JY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022570/bfarsace_201106_4269_014.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The camera bump on the 12 Pro Max is larger than the 12 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C3iGuY"&gt;It’s the main wide camera and the telephoto that are very different on the 12 Pro Max. The wide has the same f/1.6 lens as the 12 and 12 Pro, but it also has a 47-percent larger physical sensor that can capture more light with less noise. The wide camera is also stabilized differently than the other iPhone 12 models, which have traditional lens-based optical image stabilization to reduce vibrations and thus blur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywkc5A"&gt;The 12 Pro Max uses sensor-shift stabilization, which moves the sensor itself around to reduce vibrations. Apple tells me the move to sensor-shift stabilization on the 12 Pro Max was more about making this sensor size work to its standards than overall performance, but that the system on the 12 Pro Max is slightly more effective at reducing a wider range of vibrations than the OIS on the 12 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iIoYH"&gt;(As an aside for camera nerds, Apple keeps calling this “sensor-shift OIS,” which doesn’t quite make sense because the lens isn’t involved. It’s more like the in-body stabilization you’ll find on Sony and Panasonic mirrorless cameras. But I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvxisg"&gt;The bigger sensor also has an impressive maximum ISO, which is a measure of light sensitivity. The iPhone 11 Pro had a top ISO of 3,072, the regular iPhone 12 Pro has a top ISO of 5,808, and the 12 Pro Max has a top ISO of 7,616. As the numbers go up, the amount of noise at any given ISO tends to go down, which means images from the iPhone 12 Pro Max are generally less noisy than the 12 Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="YW9SmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 12 Pro Max’s main camera is one of the most confident smartphone cameras I’ve ever used&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yn9hg"&gt;The upshot of all this is simple: the wide camera on the iPhone 12 Pro Max is one of the most confident smartphone cameras I’ve ever used. It can take great photos in a huge variety of situations, and rarely feels pushed beyond its limits.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;In broad daylight it’s hard to tell the pics from any modern high-end phone apart. | Left to right: Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple iPhone 12 Pro, Google Pixel 5, Samsung Note 20 Ultra&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bkNXbX"&gt;You won’t always see the benefit from that increased capability; it really depends on what kind of light you’re taking photos in. In sunlight and other bright situations, photos from the 12 Pro Max and 12 Pro look identical to me — we’re at the point where photos from all the major flagships are starting to look the same. Yes, there are differences: the Pixel 5 is a little more contrasty, the iPhone still boosts shadows the most aggressively, and the Note 20 does some weird things with reds and yellows, but when any of these cameras gets enough light, they produce photos that are more alike than different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95zl33"&gt;But when the light gets dimmer, the 12 Pro Max really starts to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIG2oD"&gt;Take this photo I took at sunset: all the phones did a fine enough job, but the 12 Pro Max has far less noise, better and more accurate colors, and more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DxyxEGagiVYUwOJPgixC7YOd1pM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022621/PXL_20201103_215341153.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKnKrJ2HLDuorkH9V5HjvjpCTKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022620/note20ultra20201103_165422.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple iPhone 12 Pro, Google Pixel 5, Samsung Note 20 Ultra. The Pro Max captures better colors and more detail as the light starts to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Upbh6"&gt;Under slightly darker conditions, most of the phones automatically shifted to their respective night modes, where they take multiple long exposures and merge them together. But the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s bigger sensor, with its higher maximum ISO, means it doesn’t automatically go into Night mode as often. And when the iPhone 12 Pro Max &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; go into Night mode, it does so with shorter exposures than the 12 Pro — in situations where the 12 Pro would take a three-second exposure, the 12 Pro Max only needed a one-second shot, resulting in a sharper photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="b2p5s2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9566760"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DGN5kF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9567014"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLvqOf"&gt;(Night mode itself has been improved across the iPhone 12 line: the iPhone 11 took Night mode shots by merging together frames with a one-second maximum exposure time, but the iPhone 12 lineup can capture two-second stabilized frames, allowing for better shadows with less noise. And if the phone detects that it’s on a tripod, it will turn off image stabilization and capture three-second frames, for a maximum 30-second night mode shot composed of ten three-second frames. The iPhone 11 would take thirty one-second frames.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfzXNt"&gt;The LIDAR sensor lets you shoot portraits in Night mode using the wide camera, which, combined with the better overall low light performance, means that Night mode portraits are better and more detailed on the 12 Pro Max than the 12 Pro and Pixel 5. It’s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tF4SCw"&gt;Overall, when it comes to low light, it feels like no contest: the iPhone 12 Pro Max consistently took better, more detailed, and less noisy photos than the Pixel 5 and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Look at how muddy the Pixel 5 looks in this basic sunset photo compared to the Pro Max, and look at how washed out the image of the truck from the Note 20 looks. Apple has noticeably moved ahead of the pack here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="gOieSX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9566923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="BN5phb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9566928"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6buSS"&gt;You might be expecting some dramatic change to depth of field because of the brighter aperture and bigger sensor — I certainly was — and while close-up photos do have a slightly increased background blur, it’s not particularly more noticeable to my eye than the 12 Pro. If you’re looking for that dramatic DSLR-style bokeh, you’ll still need to turn on Portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0g5Q7"&gt;The benefits of the bigger sensor are less apparent in video — and really, they’re only really noticeable if you’re watching on a larger screen like a TV. At night, you’ll see a little more detail and less noise in the shadows compared to the 12 Pro, and there’s the tiniest more detail in bright light, but you have to go looking for it. We already thought the 12 Pro was far ahead of the pack in terms of video, and the 12 Pro Max is maybe a tiny bit better, but it’s not nearly as dramatic as the improvement in stills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx2MS"&gt;(I did a deep dive on Dolby Vision in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;12 Pro review&lt;/a&gt;, and all the promise is there, as are the compatibility challenges, so go watch that video for more. And there’s still a lot of lens flare going on. Apple told me that there shouldn’t be any increased lens flare over the iPhone 11 line, but that the improved low-light performance means people are noticing it more, which feels roughly equivalent to saying “I’m a perfectionist” when someone asks you for your biggest weakness. Sure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FSn4v"&gt;The telephoto camera is less straightforwardly improved. It is essentially the same sensor as the 12 Pro, but with a longer 2.5x zoom and a less-bright f/2.2 lens instead of the 2x f/2.0 lens on the regular 12 Pro. So: a longer zoom that can pick up less light. It’s a tradeoff, but I found I really enjoyed having the tighter zoom, and I went to use it more than the telephoto on my 11 Pro. It performed slightly worse in lower light than the 2x zoom on 12 Pro, but I think it still has the upper hand compared to the Note 20 Ultra and Pixel 5 — Apple’s Smart HDR 3 is really good this year, with excellent noise reduction and vibrant colors that are still accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="owE6nE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:9567049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G9cAgv"&gt;All in all, the combination of the larger sensor, faster lens, improved stabilization, LIDAR, and processing power means that the iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera I’ve ever used — it produces terrific, colorful photos with excellent detail in lighting situations where other phones start to struggle. We’ve seen Android phone makers like Samsung and Huawei use much bigger sensors this year with a variety of complicated techniques to make them work, but Apple’s approach of pairing a moderate sensor size jump with its focus on improved processing has kept it in the lead. I’m intrigued by Apple’s new ProRAW format that promises the editing flexibility of RAW images from this sensor with the processing of Smart HDR… but it’s not out yet, so we’ll have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crCsTZ"&gt;Lastly, I have to mention the selfie camera, which is stubbornly the same as the other iPhone 12s. Many people will use the selfie camera more often than the telephoto or ultrawide cameras; it’s well overdue for a serious improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STO1HxuiN5bphgE700cOHR4bOmc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022554/bfarsace_201106_4269_001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The 6.7-inch OLED screen is the largest ever for an iPhone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oEcEKF"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max Display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dYBf8C"&gt;Apart from the cameras, the rest of the iPhone 12 Pro Max is very similar to the iPhone 12 Pro. The display is obviously bigger, but it’s just as bright and colorful, and the pixel density is essentially the same. And there’s not a ton more information presented on the big screen by default. I think that’s a shame — this thing is veering into tablet territory in terms of size, and I’d like to see Apple allow app developers to make better use of all this real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hvt8KS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every other flagship phone this year has a 120Hz display, it’s odd for the top of the line iPhone to not have it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vre03b"&gt;Disappointingly, the iPhone 12 Pro Max still has a 60Hz-refresh-rate display, while virtually every Android phone above $600 is now at 120Hz. This was maybe passable on the standard 12, but on the 12 Pro and especially the Pro Max, I think it’s a miss — it’s the most expensive iPhone with the biggest battery, and the display shouldn’t be one tick behind the competition. Maybe next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcPAUr"&gt;The 12 Pro Max adds the same MagSafe magnetic wireless charging system as the other iPhone 12s, but Apple’s charging adapters are expensive and suffer from the usual USB-C spec confusion. I am &lt;em&gt;eagerly&lt;/em&gt; anticipating the first wave of MagSafe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;car mounts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545486/moment-magsafe-iphone-12-case-mount-announced"&gt;other accessories&lt;/a&gt; — MagSafe has all the potential to be terrific, but Apple’s ability to build and nurture accessory ecosystems around its connector ideas is iffy at best. (See: the near-total lack of iPad keyboards that use the Smart Connector.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1OAnyY"&gt;5G on the iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1BunY0"&gt;I tested the 12 Pro on Verizon’s network, which offers ultrafast millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G on various street corners and sports stadiums around the country, so for the 12 Pro Max I used AT&amp;amp;T’s network. And 5G in the US continues to be a deeply mixed bag that is barely worth discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4LJaq"&gt;Speeds where I could find AT&amp;amp;T’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21014816/att-low-band-5g-network-broad-10-cities-launch-speeds-internet"&gt;standard 5G service&lt;/a&gt; were not so much better than really good LTE, and AT&amp;amp;T’s mmWave network is essentially nowhere to be found. And AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G plan automatically enables a “feature” called Stream Saver which streams all video at 480p because this so-called “unlimited” plan has complicated limits. So you’ve got a huge phone with a beautiful display and a fast connection that displays most video in… DVD resolution. C’mon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1j01B4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;5G in the US is more hype than reality and you can ignore it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNYFEl"&gt;I don’t mean to just dunk on AT&amp;amp;T: Sascha Segan at PC Mag just released data showing that 5G in the US is &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status"&gt;slower than anywhere else in the world&lt;/a&gt;. So 5G is not only hard to find, it’s slower. If there was ever a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte"&gt;race to 5G&lt;/a&gt;,” the United States has lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fId2yo"&gt;Anyway, I cannot stress this enough: 5G in the United States is more hype than reality, and you should not buy a phone because of it. Just ignore it for another year. It’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA_uvgR0fz0wgC4CBVIGimC7eLc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022556/bfarsace_201106_4269_027.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The big size of the Pro Max allows for a big battery, which translates into big battery life.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3gBIeu"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro Max Performance and Battery Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8BJfG2"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is a big phone, and as such, it has a big battery. And so battery life is terrific. At home, on WiFi, I saw screen-on times of as long as 14 hours as I doomscrolled through our interminable election, with an average of well over eight hours in more reasonable (and healthy) use over the course of a week. Now, I’m not leaving my house as much as I did before the pandemic, and I didn’t test a lot on 5G or even LTE, but with numbers like that, I’d expect battery life overall to be tremendous in almost any circumstance. Big phone, big battery, big battery life. It makes the lack of a 120Hz display puzzling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37pUx3JgB0PUKctA6KREwo-rwJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022582/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the most iPhone you can buy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="cIvgGf"&gt;I’m just going to say it again: the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a very big phone. Big ambition, big camera sensor, big… size. I’ve been using it for a week, and I still haven’t gotten used to how big it is. I’m curious to see how accessory makers handle the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUeO4x"&gt;But the size allows for what I think is easily the best and most capable smartphone camera on the market right now, and a battery that seems to last forever. If you can deal with the size, I think it’s worth passing over the 12 Pro and getting the 12 Pro Max. Those are two dramatic and meaningful improvements for the money. This is a tremendous phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="39txgl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best iPhone... if you can deal with its size&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="COmL5P"&gt;But I can’t shake the feeling that the iPhone 12 Pro Max very much feels like the perfect phone for the life I led &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the pandemic. I used to spend a lot of time commuting, and on airplanes, and otherwise out and about getting work done on my phone. I used to go to a lot of events at night and take a lot of photos in bars. My notes indicate that I used to care a lot about mobile network speeds. This phone would have made significant improvements to all those things, but right now it just feels like another screen for social media on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCaoBt"&gt;I have a kid, and I always buy the latest phone to have the best camera. And there’s no question that this is the best camera. But if you’re feeling that usual tug to upgrade and you don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to, I do think you can wait this one out. Maybe 5G will be better next year. Maybe we’ll get that 120Hz display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="27J05I"&gt;Also: did I mention that it’s big?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="y5soJj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9534129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
